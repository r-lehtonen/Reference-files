# Reference-files
When doing a bibliographic search in different databases, we obtain several BibTex or csv files, with many duplicate articles. 
So the purpose of this script was to make it easier to join files and remove duplicates. 
As example we used 3 files with data of bibliographic search in ScienceDirect, Web of Science and PubMed.
In ScienceDirect and Web of Science we used the option save as BibTex. In PubMed this option is not available, so I saved as csv
or download direct with the pubmedR package.
A word cloud can be construted with the abstracts.
