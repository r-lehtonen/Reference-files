abstract={Government-sanctioned use of nerve agents (NA) has escalated dramatically in recent years. Oxime reactivators of organophosphate (OP)-inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) serve as antidotes toward poisoning by OPNAs. The oximes used as therapeutics are quaternary compounds that cannot penetrate the blood–brain barrier (BBB). There remains an urgent need for the development of next generation OPNA therapeutics. We have developed two high-throughput screening (HTS) assays using a fluorogenic NA surrogate, O-ethyl methylphosphonyl O-4-methyl-3-cyano-coumarin (EMP-MeCyC). EMP-MeCyC detoxification and EMP-BChE reactivation screening campaigns of ~155,000 small molecules resulted in the identification of 33 nucleophile candidates, including non-quaternary oximes. Four of the oximes were reactivators of both Sarin- and VX-inhibited BChE and directly detoxified Sarin. One oxime also detoxified VX. The novel reactivators included a non-quaternary pyridine amidoxime, benzamidoxime, benzaldoxime and a piperidyl-ketoxime. The VX-inhibited BChE reactivation reaction rates by these novel molecules were similar to those observed with known bis-quaternary reactivators and faster than mono-quaternary pyridinium oximes. Notably, we discovered the first ketoxime reactivator of OP-ChEs and detoxifier of OPNAs. Preliminary toxicological studies demonstrated that the newly discovered non-quaternary oximes were relatively non-toxic in mice. The discovery of unique non-quaternary oximes opens the door to the design of novel therapeutics and decontamination agents following OPNA exposure. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The novel di((camphorsulfonyl)oxy)iodo]benzene (DCIB) was synthesized from [Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene in the mild conditions. The α-sulfonoxylation of various ketones with novel hypervalent iodine was reported in excellent yield. α-Hydroxyketones were synthesized from α-sulfonoxy compounds (caphorsulfonoxy ketones) with Li/NH3(g) at -20 °C in THF. Then, some biochemical studies including several enzyme inhibition linked some global diseases were carried out. For this purpose, the inhibitory potentials of synthesized novel camphorsulfonoxy ketones were investigated against hCA I, and hCA II isoenzymes, AChE, and BChE enzymes. When the results were evaluated, novel α-sulfonoxy ketones were found to have strong inhibition effects on these metabolic enzymes. IC50 values and Ki values were determined for each compounds and compared with putative and positive controls. The synthesized α-sulfonoxy ketone compounds showed Ki values of in range of 73.2–406.0 µM against hCA I, and 57.12–526.05 µM against hCA II closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes in living organisms. On the other hand, Ki values were found in range of 28.80–140.3 µM against AChE, and 7.186–40.0 µM against BChE enzymes. Within the scope of the study, the inhibition types of the α-sulfonoxy ketones with novel hypervalent iodine were evaluated.

abstract={Background: Genetic-based individual differences remain a promising area for studying cancer susceptibility. BCHE gene encodes the butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzyme, which has been linked to inflammation and tumor genesis. The commonest missense mutation of BCHE gene is the rs1803274 G/A polymorphism. We aimed to analyze BCHE rs1803274 gene polymorphism in terms of distribution among breast cancer patients, its effect on enzyme activity and its correlation with clinic pathological parameters. Methods: 160 breast cancer female patients matched by age with 120 female healthy controls were recruited. CA 15–3 and CEA were measured by ELISA. BChE activity was measured by spectrophotometry. BCHE rs1803274 polymorphism was analyzed by real time- PCR. Results: Significant higher prevalence of GA genotype and A allele were observed in patients [P < 0.001, OR (95% CI); 3.12 (1.67–5.85), P < 0.001, OR (95% CI); 2.86 (1.68–4.87) respectively]. This significance was observed under the dominant mode of inheritance (P < 0.001, OR (95% CI); 3.22 (1.78–5.85). GA + AA patients showed significant association with tumor grade, stage, and metastasis (P < 0.001). GA + AA patients exhibited significantly lower BChE activity compared to GG patients (3648.5 (2968–4332) mU/ml and 7128.5 (6332–8341) mU/ml respectively, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Higher frequency of the A-variant of BCHE rs1803274 and the associated low activity of BChE in breast cancer patients could represent susceptibility elements for development of breast cancer. Moreover, the rs1803274 is linked to some tumor features, which could be a proof of its prognostic value. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Different and alternative renewable-source materials, commonly called bioplastics, have been proposed due to the high production and consumption of petroleum-derived plastics and to their high toxicity in the biota. However, their toxicological safety has not yet been assessed in a comprehensive way; therefore, their effects on several animal groups remain completely unknown. Thus, we aimed at testing the following hypothesis: the exposure of Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles to polylaic acid biomicroplastic (PLA BioMP) at environmentally relevant concentrations (760 and 15,020 μg/L) induces physiological changes in them. Based on the collected data, biopolymer uptake changed tadpoles' growth and development features, reduced their lipid reserves (it was inferred by decreased triglyceride levels), as well as increased reactive oxygen and nitric oxide species production after 14-day exposure. The proportional increase in total glutathione levels, and in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, was not enough to counterbalance the production of reactive species. In addition, the two tested concentrations caused cholinesterase effect, which was marked by increased acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. This finding is indicative of the neurotoxic action of PLA BioMP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the harmful consequences of exposing amphibian representatives to the herein tested biopolymers. Therefore, this finding encourages further studies and contributes to demystify the idea that bioplastics are “harmless” to the aquatic biota in freshwater environments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of this project was to introduce novel bioactive compounds through the design and synthesis of two mono-Schiff bases, 4- [(5-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)imino]methylbenzene-1,3-diol (L1) and 2- [(5-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)imino]methyl}-6-methoxyphenol (L2) and one bis-Schiff base, 2,2′-{1H-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diylbis [nitrilomethylylidene]}bis(6-methoxyphenol) (L3) together with their complexes of transition metals [VO(IV), Cr(III), Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)]. The molecular structures of as-synthesized Schiff bases were explicitly confirmed by physical, spectral, analytical and computational studies. Quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed at B3LYP/6-311+G(d.p) level to explore the optimized geometrical structures, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), Mulliken atomic charges (MAC) and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis of the as-synthesized ligands. The FMO energy gaps were rationalized to be 0.162, 0.158 and 0.138 eV for ligands (L1), (L2) and (L3), respectively which can efficiently polarize their chemical structures. As-synthesized metal complexes have good agreement with their purposed structures with octahedral geometry except vanadium complexes, which have square pyramidal geometry. As-synthesized compounds were also evaluated through thermogravimetry and fluorescence analysis. Additionally, the compounds were also scrutinized for antibacterial activity against five bacterial strains (Halomonas halophila, Chromohalobacter israelensis, Escherichia coli, Chromohalobacter salexigens and Halomonas salina) and enzyme inhibition bioassay against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The results showed that the complexes (15) and (1) were the most active inhibitors of BChE and AChE enzymes with 94.60% and 90.90% activity, respectively. Moreover, all the compounds also exhibited significant antibacterial activity. It has been found that the metal complexes displayed more biological activity in contrary to parent ligands as a result of chelation. © 2021},

abstract={Although many polymers are known by their toxicity, we know nothing about the impact of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on anurofauna. Its presence in different products and disposal in aquatic environments turn assessments about its impact on amphibians an urgent matter. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that short-time exposure (72 h) of tadpoles belonging to the species Physalaemus cuvieri (Anura, Leptodactylidae) to PEG induces oxidative stress and neurotoxicity on them. We observed that polymer uptake in P. cuvieri occurred after exposure to 5 and 10 mg/L of PEG without inducing changes in their nitrite levels neither at the levels of substances reactive to thiobarbituric acid. However, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species production was higher in animals exposed to PEG, whose catalase and superoxide dismutase levels were not enough to counterbalance the production of these reactive species. Therefore, this finding suggests physiological changes altering REDOX homeostasis into oxidative stress. In addition, the increased activity of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, and reduction in superficial neuromasts, confirmed PEG's neurotoxic potential. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on PEG's biological impact on a particular amphibian species. The study has broadened the understanding about ecotoxicological risks associated with water pollution by these polymers, as well as motivated further investigations on its impacts on amphibians’ health and on the dynamics of their natural populations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Characterization of all compounds used was supported by a series of spectroscopic techniques such as UV–Vis, FT-IR 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-MS, etc. The confirmation of the molecular structure of 4-(1-methyl-1H-imidazole-2-thiol) phthalonitrile (1) by single crystal x-ray diffraction experiment was performed for the first time in this work. Besides, the intra/inter-molecular interactions inside the obtained crystal structure have been investigated. Afterward, the effects of the central metal atoms and solvents on the photophysicochemical properties of the phthalocyanines were analyzed to investigate their potential to use as a photosensitizer in photodynamic theraphy (PDT). The obtained results show that the phthalocyanines have therapeutic outcomes for cancer treatment. It has been seen that all compounds have a better ability to inhibit compared to existing tried inhibitors. Among these, the best inhibitors against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes are (4) (Ki 47.71±9.14 µM and IC50 68.22) and (3a) (Ki 20.12±3.75 µM and IC50 19.24), respectively. Also, against α-Glycosidase, (4) showed the highest effect (Ki 9.13±1.05 µM and IC50 11.22).

abstract={Cholinesterases act as bio scavengers to clear organophosphorus (OP) compounds and prodrugs. The butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) gene has been found in several types of teleost fish but this gene has yet to be identified in cyprinid fish. Indeed, BChE homologs have not been found in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genomic database. Here, we demonstrate that BChE activity is present in zebrafish, in line with other groups' findings. Using in-gel native-PAGE enzymatic activity staining and LC-MS/MS technique, an atypical BChE-like protein was identified in zebrafish. The si:ch211-93f2.1 gene was cloned, and His-tagged recombinant protein was expressed using the Pichia yeast system. The purified protein (molecular weight ~ 180 kDa) showed BChE activity, and degraded acetylcholinesterase (ACh) at a higher rate than BCh. However, phylogram analysis shows that this novel cholinesterase shared an evolutionary origin with carboxylic esterase rather than BChE. The zebrafish BChE-like protein shares structural characteristics with cholinesterase and carboxylesterase. The 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), nicosulfuron, and triacetin exhibited a higher binding affinity to the zebrafish BChE-like protein than BCh and ACh. With the identification of BChE-like protein in zebrafish, this study could shed light on the origin of BChE and may contribute towards the development of a BChE knockout zebrafish model for sensitive drug or toxin screening. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Exogenously administered human serum butyrylcholinesterase (Hu BChE) affords protection by binding to organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents and pesticides in circulation. The resulting Hu BChE-OP conjugate undergoes ‘aging’ and the conjugate circulates until cleared from the body. Thus, we evaluated the effects of Hu BChE-OP conjugates on the general health and operant behavior of macaques. Rhesus macaques trained to perform a six-item serial probe recognition (SPR) task were administered 30 mg/kg of Hu BChE-soman conjugate (n = 4) or Hu BChE-VX conjugate (n = 4) by intramuscular injection. Performance on the SPR task was evaluated at 60–90 min after conjugate administration and daily thereafter for the next 4 weeks. Diazepam (3.2 mg/kg), a positive control, was administered 5 weeks after conjugate administration and performance on the SPR task was evaluated as before. Blood collected throughout the study was analyzed for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BChE activities. Residual BChE activity of conjugates displayed a similar pharmacokinetic profile as free Hu BChE. Neither of the Hu BChE-OP conjugates produced clear or pronounced degradations in performance on the SPR task. In contrast, diazepam clearly impaired performance on the SPR task on the day of administration in 7 of 8 macaques (and sometimes longer). Taken together, these results suggest that Hu BChE-OP conjugates are safe and provide further support for the development of Hu BChE as a bioscavenger for use in humans. © 2021},

abstract={Natural product is a well-known source of bioactive compounds. Herein, a steroidal compound stigmasta-7,22-diene-3-one (stigmastadienone) has been isolated from Isodon rugosus. The potency of isolated compound has been tested for several in-vitro targets. The acetyl and butyrylcholinesterase assays were performed using Ellman's procedure. For the in-vitro antidiabetic potential, α-glucosidase inhibitory assay was performed. Similarly, the cyclo and lipoxygenase pathways were studied to find its potential role in the management of inflammation and analgesia. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) assays were performed for the antioxidant potentials. Docking studies were performed against acetylcholinesterase, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase targets. In anticholinesterase assays, stigmastadienone exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 13.52 and 11.53 μg/ml for acetyl and butyrylcholinesterase respectively. The observed IC50 values for that of galantamine were 6.07 and 4.42 μg/ml for acety and butyrylcholinesterase respectively. In inhibiting α-glucosidase enzyme, the compound showed mediocre IC50 of 109.40 μg/ml compared to the standard acarbose (7.60 μg/ml). The stigmastadienone proved to be an excellent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) attaining IC50 values of 4.72 and 3.36 μg/ml respectively. The standard drugs IC50 values for COX-2 (celecoxib) and 5-LOX (montelukast) were 3.81 and 2.74 μg/ml respectively. The enzymatic activities of stigmastadienone were also supplemented with antioxidant results, specifically it was more dominant against DPPH and ABTS free radicals. Docking studies showed that only the carbonyl oxygen is able to form hydrogen bond interaction with the residues. In conclusions, the stigmastadienone has been isolated from Isodon rugosus for the first time. Moreover, the compound has been evaluated for several biochemical pathways which suggest its pharmacological role on the explored targets. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The impacts on human health and the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic COVID-19 have been devastating. However, its environmental consequences are poorly understood. Thus, to assess whether COVID-19 therapy based on the use of azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during the pandemic affects wild aquatic life, we exposed (for 72 h) neotropical tadpoles of the species Physalaemus cuvieri to the water containing these drugs to 12.5 μg/L. We observed that the increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase in tadpoles exposed to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) was predominant to keep the production of NO, ROS, TBARS and H2O2 equitable between the experimental groups. In addition, the uptake of AZT and the strong interaction of AZT with acetylcholinesterase (AChE), predicted by the molecular docking analysis, were associated with the anticholinesterase effect observed in the groups exposed to the antibiotic. However, the unexpected increase in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in these same groups suggests its constitutive role in maintaining cholinergic homeostasis. Therefore, taken together, our data provide a pioneering evidence that the exposure of P. cuvieri tadpoles to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) in a predictably increased environmental concentration (12.5 μg/L) elicits a compensatory adaptive response that can have, in the short period of exposure, guaranteed the survival of the animals. However, the high energy cost for maintaining physiological homeostasis, can compromise the growth and development of animals and, therefore, in the medium-long term, have a general negative effect on the health of animals. Thus, it is possible that COVID-19 therapy, based on the use of AZT, affects wild aquatic life, which requires greater attention to the impacts that this drug may represent. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by a chronic hyperglycemia state, increased oxidative stress parameters, and inflammatory processes. Aims: To evaluate the effect of caffeic acid (CA) on ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzymatic activity and expression of the A2A receptor of the purinergic system, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymatic activity and expression of the α7nAChR receptor of the cholinergic system as well as inflammatory and oxidative parameters in diabetic rats. Methods: Diabetes was induced by a single dose intraperitoneally of streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg). Animals were divided into six groups (n = 10): control/oil; control/CA 10 mg/kg; control/CA 50 mg/kg; diabetic/oil; diabetic/CA 10 mg/kg; and diabetic/CA 50 mg/kg treated for thirty days by gavage. Results: CA treatment reduced ATP and ADP hydrolysis (lymphocytes) and ATP levels (serum), and reversed the increase in ADA and AChE (lymphocytes), BuChE (serum), and myeloperoxidase (MPO, plasma) activities in diabetic rats. CA treatment did not attenuate the increase in IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression (lymphocytes) in the diabetic state; however, it increased IL-10 and A2A gene expression, regardless of the animals' condition (healthy or diabetic), and α7nAChR gene expression. Additionally, CA attenuated the increase in oxidative stress markers and reversed the decrease in antioxidant parameters of diabetic animals. Conclusion: Overall, our findings indicated that CA treatment positively modulated purinergic and cholinergic enzyme activities and receptor expression, and improved oxi-inflammatory parameters, thus suggesting that this phenolic acid could improve redox homeostasis dysregulation and purinergic and cholinergic signaling in the diabetic state. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recent advances in cholinesterase inhibitors opened new venues for the treatment of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Certain azole antifungals like miconazole were reported to have cholinesterase inhibitory effects and hence ameliorate cognitive deficits. In this study, we tested a set of azole antifungal derivatives selected through virtual screening of an inhouse library for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory effects. Compound 61 showed potent and selective AChE inhibition (IC50 = 8.77 µM). The study also yielded dual AChE/BChE inhibitors in addition to a number of potent AChE inhibitors. Enzyme kinetics assays revealed that AChE inhibitors were competitive inhibitors. All the active compounds were imidazole derivatives and the modeling study showed that imidazole at protonated state contributed greatly to the binding interactions with some key residues of AChE and BChE active site. The active derivatives had negligible cytotoxic effects on murine fibroblast viability. According to our results, compounds featuring the classical scaffold of azole antifungal drugs could hold high potential for anticholinesterase drug design. © 2021},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a regulator for the cholinesterase activity in serum, is an important index for clinical diagnosis of organophosphorus poisoning and liver related disease. However, the assays for BChE activity are highly dependent on expensive and bulk equipment and professional operators, which limits its straightforward and portable detection. In this work, we proposed a straightforward and sensitive photothermal assay for the detection of BChE activity, avoiding the use of expensive instrument, professional operators, and separation process. Polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles can be produced through the oxidation of dopamine by MnO2 nanosheets, which show a rather strong photothermal features. Hydrolyzation of substrate into thiocholine and butyrate happens after introducing BChE. The generated thiocholine and butyrate inhibit the formation of PDA nanoparticle through reducing MnO2 into Mn2+ and creating an acidic environment, respectively. Those effects lead to the decreasing of photothermal efficiency of the reaction system, resulting in the decreasing on temperature change. Quantitative detection of BChE activity is achieved by recording the temperature change of system, using a common device, with a limit of detection of 40.65 U/L calculated. The presented results provide a clue for developing straightforward and portable photothermal assay for BChE, which shows great potential for their clinical applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SpAD), acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, co-regulators of acetylcholine, are associated with β-amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in patterns suggesting a contribution to neurotoxicity. This association has not been explored in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). We investigated whether cholinesterases are observed in the neuropathological hallmarks in FAD expressing the presenilin 1 Leu235Pro mutation. Brain tissues from three FAD cases and one early-onset SpAD case were stained and analyzed for β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. AD pathology was prominent throughout the rostrocaudal extent of all 4 brains but α-synuclein-positive neurites were present in only one familial case. In FAD and SpAD cases, cholinergic activity was associated with plaques and tangles but not with α-synuclein pathology. Both cholinesterases showed similar or decreased plaque staining than detected with β-amyloid immunostaining but greater plaque deposition than observed with thioflavin-S histofluorescence. Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase are highly associated with AD pathology in inherited disease and both may represent specific diagnostic and therapeutic targets for all AD forms. © 2021},

abstract={Salivary biomarkers were studied in 17 healthy Large White sows from early gestation to the end of lactation. Saliva samples were obtained at 34 ± 3 days from insemination (G30), 24 ± 4 days before farrowing (G90), within the first 24 h after farrowing (L1) and at the end of a lactation period of 21 days (L21). The measurements in saliva included stress-related biomarkers (cortisol, chromogranin A, α-amylase, butyrylcholinesterase [BChE] and lipase [Lip]), inflammatory biomarkers (adenosine deaminase isoenzymes 1 [ADA1] and 2 [ADA2], and haptoglobin [Hp]) and oxidative stress biomarkers (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing ability, uric acid, advanced oxidation protein products [AOPP] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]), as well as routine biochemistry analytes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], γ-glutamine transferase [GGT], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], creatine kinase [CK], urea, creatinine, triglycerides, lactate, calcium and phosphorus). The main changes were observed at farrowing, with increases in biomarkers of stress (cortisol and BChE), inflammation (ADA isoenzymes and Hp) and oxidative stress (AOPP and H2O2), as well as muscle and hepatic enzymes (CK, AST, ALP, GGT and LDH). Lactate and triglycerides increased at the end of gestation and remained at high concentrations until the end of lactation. Lip was higher in gestation than at lactation. Thus, changes in biomarkers of stress, immune function, oxidative stress, hepatic and muscle integrity, and energy mobilization occur in sow saliva during pregnancy, farrowing and lactation. These changes, caused by physiological conditions, should be taken into consideration when these biomarkers are used for the evaluation of sow health and welfare. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Objectives: The only proteins known to be modified by O-linked lipidation are Wnts and ghrelin, and enzymatic removal of this post-translational modification inhibits ligand activity. Indeed, the Wnt-deacylase activity of Notum is the basis of its ability to act as a feedback inhibitor of Wnt signalling. Whether Notum also deacylates ghrelin has not been determined. Methods: We used mass spectrometry to assay ghrelin deacylation by Notum and co-crystallisation to reveal enzyme–substrate interactions at the atomic level. CRISPR/Cas technology was used to tag endogenous Notum and assess its localisation in mice while liver-specific Notum knock-out mice allowed us to investigate the physiological role of Notum in modulating the level of ghrelin deacylation. Results: Mass spectrometry detected the removal of octanoyl from ghrelin by purified active Notum but not by an inactive mutant. The 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of the Notum-ghrelin complex showed that the octanoyl lipid was accommodated in the hydrophobic pocket of the Notum. The knock-in allele expressing HA-tagged Notum revealed that Notum was produced in the liver and present in the bloodstream, albeit at a low level. Liver-specific inactivation of Notum in animals fed a high-fat diet led to a small but significant increase in acylated ghrelin in the circulation, while no such increase was seen in wild-type animals on the same diet. Conclusions: Overall, our data demonstrate that Notum can act as a ghrelin deacylase, and that this may be physiologically relevant under high-fat diet conditions. Our study therefore adds Notum to the list of enzymes, including butyrylcholinesterase and other carboxylesterases, that modulate the acylation state of ghrelin. The contribution of multiple enzymes could help tune the activity of this important hormone to a wide range of physiological conditions. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Neurodegenerative diseases have been characterized by loss of neuron structures as well as their functions. This study was designed to assess molecular docking of flavonoids from Andrographis paniculata as potential acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Eight identified possible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and monoamine oxidase from Andrographis paniculata were retrieved from the PubChem database. The molecular docking, ADMET, and Lipinski’s rule of five were examined using different bioinformatic tools. It was shown that only rutin has the highest binding affinity (-12.6 kcal/mol) than the standard used. ADMET results demonstrated that all the eight compounds are druggable candidates except rutin. Also, only tangeritin has a blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation potential. Hence, it can be deduced that all flavonoid compounds from Andrographis paniculata are orally druggable, which can make them useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases better than donepezil. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Looking for an effective anti-Alzheimer's agent is very challenging; however, a multifunctional ligand strategy may be a promising solution for the treatment of this complex disease. We herein present the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel hydroxyethylamine derivatives displaying unique, multiple properties that have not been previously reported. The original mechanism of action combines inhibitory activity against disease-modifying targets: β-secretase enzyme (BACE1) and amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation, along with an effect on targets associated with symptom relief - inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and γ-aminobutyric acid transporters (GATs). Among the obtained molecules, compound 36 exhibited the most balanced and broad activity profile (eeAChE IC50 = 2.86 μM; eqBuChE IC50 = 60 nM; hBuChE IC50 = 20 nM; hBACE1 IC50 = 5.9 μM; inhibition of Aβ aggregation = 57.9% at 10 μM; mGAT1 IC50 = 10.96 μM; and mGAT2 IC50 = 19.05 μM). Moreover, we also identified 31 as the most potent mGAT4 and hGAT3 inhibitor (IC50 = 5.01 μM and IC50 = 2.95 μM, respectively), with high selectivity over other subtypes.

abstract={An expanded series of alkyl 2-arylhydrazinylidene-3-oxo-3-polyfluoroalkylpropionates (HOPs) 3 was obtained via Cu(OAc)2-catalyzed azo coupling. All were nanomolar inhibitors of carboxylesterase (CES), while moderate or weak inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Steady-state kinetics studies showed that HOPs 3 are mixed type inhibitors of the three esterases. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that two functional groups in the structure of HOPs, trifluoromethyl ketone (TFK) and ester groups, bind to the CES active site suggesting subsequent reactions: formation of a tetrahedral adduct, and a slow hydrolysis reaction. The results of molecular modeling allowed us to explain some structure-activity relationships of CES inhibition by HOPs 3: their selectivity toward CES in comparison with cholinesterases and the high selectivity of pentafluoroethyl-substituted HOP 3p to hCES1 compared to hCES2. All compounds were predicted to have good intestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier permeability, low cardiac toxicity, good lipophilicity and aqueous solubility, and reasonable overall drug-likeness. HOPs with a TFK group and electron-donor substituents in the arylhydrazone moiety were potent antioxidants. All compounds possessed low cytotoxicity and low acute toxicity. Overall, a new promising type of bifunctional CES inhibitors has been found that are able to interact with the active site of the enzyme with the participation of two functional groups. The results indicate that HOPs have the potential to be good candidates as human CES inhibitors for biomedicinal applications. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents represent a class of highly toxic chemical warfare agents banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Nevertheless, in the past few years they have been used repeatedly for warfare, assassination and attempted murder. In addition, the chemically related OP pesticides were frequently used for suicide and may be deployed for terroristic attacks. Therefore, sensitive and selective bioanalytical methods are indispensable to investigate biological specimens as pieces of evidence to prove poisoning. OP agents form long-lived covalent reaction products (adducts) with endogenous proteins like human serum albumin (HSA) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The adducted nonapeptide (NP) obtained by proteolysis of the BChE-adduct is one of the most sensitive and important biomarkers. We herein present a novel class of NP-adducts propionylated at its N-terminal phenylalanine residue (F195). The biomarker derivative is produced by addition of propionic anhydride to the NP-adduct inducing its quantitative conversion in aqueous buffer within 5 min at room temperature. Afterwards the mixture is directly analyzed by micro-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem-mass spectrometry (µLC-ESI MS/MS). The sensitivity of the method is comparable to that of the non-derivatized NP-adduct. These characteristics make the method highly beneficial for forensic analysis especially in cases in which the OP agent does not form adducts with HSA that are typically targeted as a second biomarker of exposure. This novel procedure was successfully applied to nerve agent-spiked samples sent by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) as well as to plasma samples of real cases of pesticide poisoning. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={To date, Alzheimer's disease is the most alarming neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. This illness is multifactorial in nature and cholinesterase inhibitors have been the ones used in clinical treatments. In this context, many of these drugs selectively inhibit the acetylcholinesterase enzyme interacting in both the active site and the peripheric anionic site. Besides, some agents have exhibited extensive benefits being able to co-inhibit butyrylcholinesterase. In this contribution, a strategy previously explored by numerous authors is reported; the synthesis of hybrid cholinesterase inhibitors. This strategy uses a molecule of recognized high inhibitory activity (tacrine) together with a steroidal alkaloid of natural origin using different connectors. The biological assays demonstrated the improvement in the inhibitory activity compared to the alkaloidal precursor, together with the reinforcement of the interactions in multiple sites of the enzymatic cavity. This strategy should be explored and exploited in this area. Docking and molecular dynamic studies were performed to explain enzyme-ligand interactions, assisting a structure–activity relationship analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The development of multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) may improve complex central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, a series of 7-O-1, 2, 3-triazole hesperetin derivatives was evaluated for their inhibition of cholinesterase, anti-neuroinflammatory, and neuroprotective activity. Among the hesperetin derivatives, compound a8 (7-O-((1-(3-chlorobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)hesperetin) possessed excellent anti-butyrylcholinesterase activity (IC50 = 3.08 ± 0.29 μM) and exhibited good anti-neuroinflammatory activity (IC50 = 2.91 ± 0.47 μM) against NO production through remarkably blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway and inhibiting the phosphorylation of P65. In addition, a8 showed a remarkable neuroprotective effect and lacked neurotoxicity up to 50 μM concentration. Furthermore, possessing significant self-mediated Aβ1-42 aggregation inhibitory activity, chelated biometals and reduced ROS production were found in compound a8. In the bi-directional transport assay, a8 exhibited a blood–brain barrier penetrating ability. In this study, the Morris water maze task showed that compound a8 significantly improved the learning and memory impairment of the scopolamine-induced AD mice model. Results highlighted the potential of compound a8 to be a potential MTDL for the development of anti-AD agents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Solanum erianthum D. Don. and S. torvum Swartz of the family Solanaceae have been extensively used for both food and pharmaceutical purposes. In this study, a metabolomic approach was used to compare the phytochemical composition and biological activity of the different plant parts of both species. The inhibitory activity against important enzymes (i.e., cholinesterases, tyrosinase, α-amylase and α-glucosidase), antimicrobial and antifungal potentials, in vitro antioxidant activity, as well as the phenolic and alkaloid profiles of the fruit, leaf and stem bark extracts of both species were studied. The results showed that the stem barks were characterized by the highest amounts of total phenolics (on average: 12.6 mg/g), whilst the S. erianthum leaves were the best source of total alkaloids (2.1 mg/g). Overall, the stem bark extracts of both species were found to be a good source of antioxidant compounds. All the extracts were effective against acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase, while only the leaf extracts of both plants were a good source of butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. The extracts have significant anti-microbial and anti-fungal potentials. A modest anti-diabetic effect was measured for α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Strong correlations (p <0.01) were found between the bioactives and the biological activities. Therefore, this study showed the potential of untargeted metabolomics to investigate the bioactive profile of plant extracts, thus providing discrimination between S. erianthum and S. torvum. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are considered to be one of the inexpensive and very important bioactive materials widely used in drug delivery, as a photo-catalyst material, antibacterial, bioimaging, anticancer, anti-inflammation, wound healing, and diabetes treatment. Therefore, we have prepared ZnO NPs using Alchemilla vulgaris (Lady's mantle) leaves and investigated their anti-enzymatic properties. Phases of the ZnO NPs were determined from X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. The shape and size of the green synthesized NPs were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and it confirms the cauliflower shape with an average size of 120 nm. But the beads inside the cauliflower shape are 20 nm in size. The prepared ZnO NPs show the cumulative median particle size of 550 nm. The thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed at different heating rates to study the percentage of weight loss, and activation energy. The activation energy was calculated to be 4.98 kJ/moles using Kissinger method. We also studied the enzyme inhibition effect of ZnO NPs containing biologically active groups on important metabolic enzymes like butyrylcholinesterase(BChE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and α-glycosidase (α-Gly) enzymes. The bandgap of ZnO NPs was also studied by UV–Vis spectroscopy via Tauc's method and it was determined to be 3.27 eV. The photocatalytic property of the ZnO NPs was executed against rhodamine B (RhB) under the illumination of an AM 1.5 solar simulator. © 2021},

abstract={Cholinergic system dysfunction, oxidative damage, and alterations in ion pump activity have been associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s disease. 1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones have emerged as a class of compounds with potential therapeutic effects due to their potent anticholinesterase activity. Accordingly, this study investigated the effect of the 2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-3-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl)thiazolidin-4-one (DS12) compound on memory, cholinergic and oxidative stress parameters, ion pump activity, and serum biochemical markers in a scopolamine-induced memory deficit model. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: I-Control; II-Scopolamine; III-DS12 (5 mg/kg) + scopolamine; and IV-DS12 (10 mg/kg) + scopolamine. The animals from groups III and IV received DS12 diluted in canola oil and administered for 7 days by gavage. On the last day of treatment, scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30 min after training in an inhibitory avoidance apparatus. Twenty-four hours after scopolamine administration, the animals were subjected to an inhibitory avoidance test and were thereafter euthanized. Scopolamine induced memory deficits, increased acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative damage, and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Pretreatment with DS12 prevented these brain alterations. Scopolamine also induced an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity in lymphocytes and whereas butyrylcholinesterase in serum and treatment with DS12 prevented these changes. In animals treated with DS12, no changes were observed in renal and hepatic parameters when compared to the control group. In conclusion, DS12 emerged as an important multitarget compound capable of preventing neurochemical changes associated with memory deficits.

abstract={The members of the genus Sideritis have a wide variety of phytochemicals and thus the genus are gaining interest to fabricate nanoparticles (via green synthesis) as sources reducing or stabilizer agents. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by an easy and eco-friendly method using aqueous extracts of three Sideritis species (Sideritis argyrea (SA), S. brevidens (SB), and S. lycia (SL)). These AgNPs were investigated in terms of cholinesterase (AChE: acetylcholinesterase and BChE: butyrylcholinesterase) and tyrosinase activities. The presence of (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes in Bragg's reflections verified the fcc (face-cantered-cubic) crystalline AgNPs. Sideritis species-directed AgNPs were characterized by surface plasmon resonance at 428–440 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations were showed the spherical and monodispersed of the AgNPs with an average particle size of 22–26 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were revealed functional groups responsible for the reduction of silver ions. Also, for the AgNPs were confirmed by the characterizations of Zeta Potential and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Chlorogenic acid (CGA) was found as major component for all three species. We demonstrated that Sideritis-directed AgNPs showed excellent inhibitory activity against BChE, while Sideritis extracts have no effective inhibitory activity against AChE. Among AgNPs, SA AgNPs exhibited the greatest tyrosinase inhibitory activity with the value of 33.02 mg kojic acid equivalents (KAE)/g, following CGA AgNPs (18.31 mg KAE/g) and SB AgNPs (5.46 mg KAE/g). Regarding the extracts, they had similar tyrosinase inhibition activity (33.61–36.34 mg KAE/g). Our findings suggest that the green synthesis by using Sideritis extracts could be open a new horizon in the biotechnological applications such as bioactivity and drug delivery. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hypericum empetrifolium Willd is a member of the Hypericaceae family, mainly known in southern Greece, and western Turkey. Being a centuries-old medicinal plant, the aerial parts of the plant have been used for the treatment of herpes, kidney stones, gastric ulcer, and also for their anti-helminthic, and diuretic purposes traditionally. Aim of the study: The current study aimed to investigate the phytochemical profiles of the essential oil, and two ethanol extracts prepared from the aerial parts (H. empetrifolium aerial parts extract – HEA), and roots of the plant (H. empetrifolium roots extract – HER), and to provide data on antioxidant, anticholinesterase, antityrosinase, antiurease, cytotoxic, and antimicrobial activities of the extracts. Materials and methods: In this study, volatile and phenolic compounds of the HEA and HER were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS, respectively. Antioxidant potential of the extracts was clarified by using DPPH radical scavenging assay, ABTS cation radical assay, and the CUPRAC assay. Acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, urease, and tyrosinase inhibitory activity assays were used to determine enzyme inhibition capacity of the extracts. Cytotoxic activity of the extracts was established by using XTT assay. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. Results: The major compounds of the essential oil were revealed as alloaromodendrene (24.7%), α-pinene (14.7%), β-pinene (10.7%), and α-terpineol (7.7%) by the GC-MS analysis. According to the LC-MS/MS analysis results, quinic acid was the most abundant constituent in both extracts with 20612.42 ± 169.02 μg/g extract in HEA extract, and with 2254.34 ± 18.49 μg/g extract in HER extract, respectively. The HEA extract was also found to be rich in terms of chlorogenic acid (5583.14 ± 38.52 μg/g extract), isoquercitrin (3076.77 ± 40.92 μg/g extract), and malic acid (2822.90 ± 31.90 μg/g extract). HEA extract exhibited a significant antioxidant effect with an IC50 value of 11.98 ± 0.22 μg/mL according to the DPPH radical scavenging assay. Similar results were obtained with the ABTS cation radical assay, and the CUPRAC assay. HER extract showed a strong butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory effect with 88.69 ± 0.62% at 200 μg/mL concentration. Both extracts were considered to have moderate anti-tyrosinase activity compared to the standard at 200 μg/mL. The best antimicrobial activity was obtained for HEA against C. parapsilosis with an MIC value of 4.88 μg/mL. HEA also exhibited antifungal activity against C. tropicalis with 19.53 μg/mL. Only HER exhibited low cytotoxicity on A498 renal cell lines with 60.6% cell viability. Conclusion: Unquestionably, H. empetrifolium Willd has ethnopharmacological importance according to these results, and further investigations are required to evaluate other therapeutic properties of the plant. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Caesalpinia bonduc and C. decapeleta var. japonica have great importance in traditional medicine systems but scientific information's are still lacking for their potentials. To explore their bioactivity, we assessed the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory abilities of the dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts prepared from the leaves and bark. The cytotoxicity and anticancer properties of the extracts were also assessed in vitro. The water extract of C. decapeleta leaves possessed highest phenolic content (108.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract), while the highest flavonoid content was recorded for the C. bonduc leaf methanolic extract (27.89 mg rutin equivalent (RE)/g extract). In general, C. decapeleta extracts possessed higher radical scavenging potential compared to C. bonduc extracts. C. decapeleta DCM leaves extract (10.20 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g extract) showed highest inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase. The cytotoxicity of the most potent methanolic and aqueous extracts were assessed against four cell lines. The chemical profiles of both species appeared to be different. C. bonduc was abundant in organic and phenolic acids as well as their esters. Flavonoid glycosides, bonducellin and its derivatives and caesalminaxins were identified. Whereas, C. decalpetala possessed many galloylated compounds. The cytotoxicity of C. bonduc and C. decapetala extracts was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) based assay on VERO (kidney of an adult African Green monkey cells), HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma cells), RKO (human colon carcinoma cells), FaDu (human hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma cells) cell lines. C. bonduc bark water extract exhibited the highest cytotoxicity towards HeLa (50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC50): 28.5 μg/mL) cancer cell line, as compared to normal VERO cells (CC50:35.87 μg/mL). For C. decapetala, the highest cytotoxicity was found for bark methanol extract on the HeLa cells with CC50 of 46.08 μg/mL and selectivity index of 3.33. In the gene ontology analysis, prostate cancer, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling, proteoglycans in cancer pathways might support the results of the cytotoxic assays. These results showed that the tested Caesalpinia species, showing potent inhibitory action against butyrylcholinesterase, might represent novel phytotherapeutic avenues for the management of Alzheimer's disease. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is detected in plaques preferentially in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and may be associated with stress disorders. However, the physiological function of BChE in the central nervous system remains to be further investigated. BChE knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice with orally or intranasal administration of (R)-bambuterol were used to explore the effect of BChE on behavior changes. (R)-bambuterol is a specific and reversible inhibitor of BChE. The behavior changes were evaluated and compared among 3-10 month old mice. Our finding showed that BChE KO and (R)-bambuterol administration enhanced episodic memory, including fear conditioning memory and fear extinction memory in fear conditioning and fear extinction test. BChE KO and (R)-bambuterol administered mice rescued age-related spatial memory and general activity in the water maze test and open field test. The brain metabolomics were imaged using a desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI). The image of DESI-MS demonstrated that glutamine content increased in the brain of BChE KO mice. In conclusion, this study found that inhibition of BChE ameliorated episodic and spatial memories. This study also suggested that (R)-bambuterol as a BChE inhibitor has the potential application in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and early cognitive decline. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Aim: Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a crucial therapeutic target because it is associated with multiple pathological elements of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An integrated computational strategy was employed to exploit effective BChE inhibitors. Methods & results: Ten compounds derived from the Enamine database by structure-based pharmacophore virtual screening were further evaluated for biological activity; out of the ten, only five had an IC50 of less than 100 μM. Among these five compounds, a new molecule, 970180, presented the most potency against BChE, with an IC50 of 4.24 ± 0.16 μM, and acted as a mixed-type inhibitor. Molecular dynamic simulations and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion prediction further confirmed its high potential as a good candidate of BChE inhibitor. Furthermore, cytotoxicity of molecule 970180 was not observed at concentrations up to 50 μM, and the molecule also showed a prominent neuroprotective effect compared with tacrine at 25 and 50 μM. Conclusion: This study provides an effective structure-based pharmacophore virtual screening method to discover BChE inhibitors and provide new choices for the development of BChE inhibitors, which may be beneficial for AD patients. © 2021},

abstract={The authors report on the synthesis and biological evaluation of new compounds whose structure combines tacrine and indole moieties. Tacrine-indole heterodimers were designed to inhibit cholinesterases and β-amyloid formation, and to cross the blood-brain barrier. The most potent new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were compounds 3c and 4d (IC50 = 25 and 39 nM, respectively). Compound 3c displayed considerably higher selectivity for acetylcholinesterase relative to human plasma butyrylcholinesterase in comparison to compound 4d (selectivity index: IC50 [butyrylcholinesterase]/IC50 [acetylcholinesterase] = 3 and 0.6, respectively). Furthermore, compound 3c inhibited β-amyloid-dependent amyloid nucleation in the yeast-based prion nucleation assay and displayed no dsDNA destabilizing interactions with DNA. Compounds 3c and 4d displayed a high probability of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The results support the potential of 3c for future development as a dual-acting therapeutic agent in the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease. © 2021},

abstract={Cholinesterases, involved in acetylcholine catabolism in the central and peripheral nervous system, have been strongly linked with neurodegenerative diseases. Current therapeutic approaches using synthetic drugs present several side effects. Hence, there is an increasing research interest in naturally-occurring dietary polyphenols, which are also considered efficacious. Food processing by-products such as brewer’s spent grain (BSG) would be a potential bio-source of polyphenols. In this study, polyphenol-rich BSG extracts using 60% acetone and 0.75% NaOH solutions were generated, which were further subjected to liquid–liquid partitioning using various organic solvents. The water-partitioned fractions of the saponified extracts had the highest total polyphenol content (6.2 ± 2.8 mgGAE/g dw) as determined by Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, while the LC-MS/MS showed ethyl acetate fraction with the highest phenolics (2.9 ± 0.3 mg/g BSG dw). The best inhibitions of acetyl-(37.9 ± 2.9%) and butyryl-(53.6 ± 7.7%) cholinesterases were shown by the diethyl ether fraction of the saponified extract. This fraction contained the highest sum of quantified phenolics (99 ± 21.2 µg/mg of extract), and with significant (p < 0.01) inhibitory contribution of decarboxylated-diferulic acid. Amongst the standards, caffeic acid presented the highest inhibition for both cholinesterases, 25.5 ± 0.2% for acetyl-and 52.3 ± 0.8% for butyryl-cholinesterase, respectively, whilst the blends insignificantly inhibited both cholinesterases. The results showed that polyphenol-rich BSG fractions have potentials as natural anti-cholinesterase agents. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Decreased cholinergic tone associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines has been observed in several human diseases associated with low-grade inflammation. We examined if this attenuated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) mechanism contributed to increased neuroinflammation observed in depression. Methods: We measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cholinergic markers (AChE and BChE activities) in 28 individuals with longstanding late-life major depression (LLMD) and 19 controls and their relationship to central and peripheral levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8). Additionally, we examined if these cholinergic indices were related to CSF markers of microglial activation and neuroinflammation (sTREM2 and complement C3). Results: Compared with controls, LLMD patients had a significant reduction in CSF BChE levels. Lower CSF BChE and AChE activities were associated with lower CSF markers of microglial and neuroinflammation (sTREM2 and C3). In addition, in LLMD patients we found an inverse relationship between peripheral marker of inflammation (plasma IL-6) and CSF BChE and AChE levels. Conclusions: Our results suggest an upregulation of the CAP mechanism in LLMD with an elevation in peripheral markers of inflammation and concomitant reduction in markers of glial activation associated with a higher cholinergic tone. Future studies should confirm these findings in a larger sample including individuals with acute and more severe depressive episodes and across all ages. © 2021},

abstract={Coculturing two or more fungi is a useful strategy to awaken the silent genes to produce structurally diverse and bioactive natural products. Through the coculture of Pestalotiopsis sp. and Penicillium bialowiezense, six new isoprenylated chromane derivatives, including two pairs of enantiomeric ones (1a/1b–2a/2b) and two optical pure ones (3–4), two new isoprenylated phenol glucoside derivatives (6–7), as well as eight known structural analogues (5 and 8–14), were obtained. The structures of these new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray crystallography, and ECD calculation. The Δ10,11 double bond of pestaloficin D (5) was revised to E-configurated based on the extensive spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 1a/1b and 2a/2b were the first examples of enantiomeric isoprenylated chromane derivatives, which were successfully separated by chiral HPLC. Additionally, all the isolated compounds were evaluated for the in vitro β-glucuronidase (GUS) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities. Compounds 1a and 1b showed significant β-glucuronidase inhibitory potency with IC50 values of 7.6 and 10.3 μM, respectively. Compound 14 exhibited moderate BChE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 21.3 μM.

abstract={A series of novel dihydropyranoindole derivatives containing sulphonamide group were designed, synthesized and evaluated for in-vitro anti-cholinesterase activity. The result showed that all the compounds exhibited potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity (IC50 = 0.41–8.79 µM) while demonstrated moderate to good activity for butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) (IC50 = 1.17–30.17 µM).

Furthermore, cell viability studies were also performed against N2a cells along with neuroprotection studies against H2O2 in the same cell line. Antioxidant studies using DPPH radical and H2O2 were also performed which revealed that all compounds possessed some antioxidant activity. Also, DNA damage protection assay for compound 5o was performed implying that compound 5o was protective in nature. ADME studies were also performed which demonstrated good pharmacokinetics.

abstract={Stabilization of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase by the divalent cations Ca+2, Mg+2, and Mn+2 was investigated. All three substantially protect the enzyme from thermal inactivation. Electron paramagnetic resonance revealed one high-affinity binding site for Mn+2 and several much weaker sites. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a single irreversible thermal transition. All three cations raise both the temperature of the transition and the activation energy, with the transition becoming more cooperative. The crystal structures of the Ca+2 and Mg+2 complexes with Torpedo acetylcholinesterase were solved. A principal binding site was identified. In both cases, it consists of four aspartates (a 4D motif), within which the divalent ion is embedded, together with several water molecules. It makes direct contact with two of the aspartates, and indirect contact, via waters, with the other two. The 4D motif has been identified in 31 acetylcholinesterase sequences and 28 butyrylcholinesterase sequences. Zebrafish acetylcholinesterase also contains the 4D motif; it, too, is stabilized by divalent metal ions. The ASSAM server retrieved 200 other proteins that display the 4D motif, in many of which it is occupied by a divalent cation. It is a very versatile motif, since, even though tightly conserved in terms of RMSD values, it can contain from one to as many as three divalent metal ions, together with a variable number of waters. This novel motif, which binds primarily divalent metal ions, is shared by a broad repertoire of proteins.

abstract={Osteoarthritis (OA) poses a major health and economic burden worldwide due to an increasing number of patients and the unavailability of disease-modifying drugs. In this review, the latest understanding of the involvement of the cholinergic system in joint homeostasis and OA will be outlined. First of all, the current evidence on the presence of the cholinergic system in the normal and OA joint will be described. Cholinergic innervation as well as the non-neuronal cholinergic system are detected. In a variety of inflammatory diseases, the classic cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway lately received a lot of attention as via this pathway cholinergic agonists can reduce inflammation. The role of this cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in the context of OA will be discussed. Activation of this pathway improved the progression of the disease. Secondly, chondrocyte hypertrophy plays a pivotal role in osteophyte formation and OA development; the impact of the cholinergic system on hypertrophic chondroblasts and endochondral ossification will be evaluated. Cholinergic stimulation increased chondrocyte proliferation, delayed chondrocyte differentiation and caused early mineralisation. Moreover, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase affect the endochondral ossification via an acetylcholine-independent pathway. Thirdly, subchondral bone is critical for cartilage homeostasis and metabolism; the cholinergic system in subchondral bone homeostasis and disorders will be explored. An increase in osteoblast proliferation and osteoclast apoptosis is observed. Lastly, current therapeutic strategies for OA are limited to symptom relief; here the impact of smoking on disease progression and the potential of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as candidate disease-modifying drug for OA will be discussed. © 2021 Osteoarthritis Research Society International},

abstract={The genus Limonium includes important halophyte plants containing a variety of bioactive compounds of therapeutic interest. In the present work, the untargeted phytochemical profiles of both aerial part and root extracts from six Limonium species namely, L. bellidifolium, L. globuliferum, L. gmelinii, L. lilacinum, L. sinuatum and L. iconicum from Turkey were determined. Furthermore, several biological activities (in vitro antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory effects) were investigated. Overall, significant amounts of total phenolics (43.64-238.18 mg g-1) and flavonoids (1.61-129.69 mg g-1) were recorded. Particularly, the root extracts of L. gmelinii, L. iconicum and L. globuliferum showed the highest total phenolic content (204.13-238.18 mg g-1), whilst the highest total flavonoid content was recorded in the root extracts of L. gmelinii (129.69 mg g-1). Overall, the tested extracts demonstrated potent radical scavenging activities in both DPPH (2,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (90.10-507.94 mg g-1 and 163.39-1175.34 mg g-1, respectively). However, the highest scavenging potential (p < 0.05) was displayed by the root extracts of L. iconicum. Conversely, the metal chelating ability assay revealed that L. lilacinum root extract showed the highest activity (21.03 mg g-1). Interestingly, all the extracts were found to be active inhibitors of cholinesterases (AChE (acetylcholinesterase): 4.20-5.11 mg GALAE (galantamine equivalent) per g; BChE (butyrylcholinesterase): 3.89-10.75 mg GALAE per g), amylase (0.52-1.09 mmol ACAE (acarbose equivalent) per g) and tyrosinase (119.41-155.67 mg KAE (kojic acid equivalent) per g), unlike for glucosidase (2.31-2.41 mmol ACAE per g). Taken together, these findings demonstrated a diverse chemical profiles and biological of the extracts, to be potentially considered as phytotherapeutic or functional ingredients due to their antioxidant properties and inhibition of key enzymes involved in several diseases. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={A new series of N-aryltacrine derivatives were designed and synthesized as cholinesterase inhibitors by the late-stage modification of tacrine, using the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction. In vitro inhibition assay against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) demonstrated that most of the synthesized compounds had potent AChE inhibitory activity with negative inhibition of BuChE. Among them, N-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-tacrine (3g) and N-(4-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-tacrine (3o) showed the most potent activity against AChE (IC50 values of 1.77 and 1.48 μM, respectively). The anti-AChE activity of 3g and 3o was 3.5 times more than that of tacrine (IC50 value of 5.16 μM). Compound 3o also displayed anti-BuChE activity with an IC50 value of 19.00 μM. Cell-based assays against HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cell lines revealed that 3o had significantly lower hepatotoxicity compared to tacrine, with additional neuroprotective activity against H2O2-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells. The advantages including synthetic accessibility, high potency, low toxicity, and adjunctive neuroprotective activity make compound 3o a new promising multifunctional candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={In the last years, in order to achieve a better treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), much focus has been put on the development of cholinesterase (Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitor drugs. Thus, the aim of this study is to discover promising active compounds for Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase enzymes inhibitors based on QSAR model and drug-likeness evaluation. In this study, a series of DL0410 and its 50 derivatives are accounted for the set up of two QSAR models. This allows an exploration of the main molecular descriptors that control the inhibitory activity of specific compounds towards cholinesterase enzymes: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Simultanerously, the models can help to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds within its applicability domain. A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis is carried out to derive QSAR models. The results indicate that the QSAR models of Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity are robust and have a very good prediction capacity, testified by values of R2 equal to 0.935 and 0.895, respectively. The analysis carried out by adopting the QSAR models succeed in screening 15 potential compounds with higher biological activity. Subsequently, the investigated compounds has been subjected to the drug-likeness evaluation and reactivity study. The results show that most of the compounds do not present any bioavailability problem when administered orally. The results also allow determining the compounds that have not clearance problems, those that are the most stable and the most reactive among those tested. These findings indicate that the newly designed candidate drugs have promising potential toward AChE and BuChE enzyme inhibition and should be experimentally investigated. © 2020},

abstract={In view of the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, a new series of methylindolinone-1,2,3-triazole derivatives (7a-n) were efficiently prepared and evaluated for their in vitro cholinesterase inhibitory activity. Although most synthesized compounds showed weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, they depicted moderate to good activity against butyrylcholinesterase. The IC50 value for anti-BuChE activity of compound 7k was calculated as 4.78 μM which was more potent than the reference drug donepezil (5.19 μM). Based on the molecular docking evaluation, it was found that compound 7k could bind simultaneously to the peripheral and catalytic sites of BuChE. Also, the optimal compound 7k was further assessed as a BACE1 inhibitor and neuroprotective agent. © 2020},

abstract={Twelve carbazole-coumarin hybrids were synthesized and biologically evaluated as dual binding site acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The structures of the carbazole-coumarin hybrids were confirmed by IR, NMR, HRMS and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The compound 3j had the crystal system of triclinic and the space group of P-1. The cholinesterase inhibitory activity of synthesized compounds was measured using colorimetric Ellman's method. Compound 3h exhibited good acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 6.72 μM) and a high selectivity over butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Compound 3k showed the best BuChE inhibitory activity with the IC50 of 0.50 μM. The SAR studies revealed that the linker length played a crucial role in determining AChE inhibitory activity and the structure of the coumarin moieties affected the BuChE-inhibition activities of the hybrids. Molecular docking study of compound 3h indicated that it interacts with the crucial amino acids present at the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. Compound 3h would be a promising drug candidate to treat AD as a selective and dual binding site inhibitor of AChE. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={New compounds containing indanone and carbamate moieties were designed based on the hybrid pharmacophore approach. The designed compounds were synthesized and fully characterized by using different methods such as IR, Mass, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HPTLC. In vitro inhibitory activities of all synthesized compounds were evaluated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The compound 3-[(5,6-dimethoxy-1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl) methyl] phenyl (4-methoxyphenyl) carbamate (4h) showed the best inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 1.20 and 0.30 μM against AChE and BChE, respectively. In addition, this compound showed a β-amyloid self-aggregation inhibitory effect (86.8%), stronger than that of donepezil (45.5%). Moreover, significant neuroprotective activity on PC12 cells against H2O2 induced cell death was demonstrated for compound 4h at 10 and 100 µM concentrations. Kinetic studies using the 4h confirmed a partial non-competitive mixed type of inhibition mechanism on both enzymes. Considering the suggested inhibition mechanism, molecular docking was used to predict the possible allosteric binding mode of 4h with both AChE and BChE enzymes. The presented indanone-carbamate scaffold can be structurally modified and optimized through medicinal chemistry-based approaches for designing novel multi-target anti-Alzheimer agents. © 2020},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifactorial, progressive neurodegeneration with impaired behavioural and cognitive functions. The multitarget-directed ligand (MTDL) strategies are promising paradigm in drug development, potentially leading to new possible therapy options for complex AD. Herein, a series of novel MTDLs phenylsulfonyl-pyrimidine carboxylate (BS-1 to BS-24) derivatives were designed and synthesized for AD treatment. All the synthesized compounds were validated by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, HRMS, and BS-19 were structurally validated by X-Ray single diffraction analysis. To evaluate the plausible binding affinity of designed compounds, molecular docking study was performed, and the result revealed their significant interaction with active sites of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The synthesized compounds displayed moderate to excellent in vitro enzyme inhibitory activity against AChE and BuChE at nanomolar (nM) concentration. Among 24 compounds (BS-1 to BS-24), the optimal compounds (BS-10 and BS-22) displayed potential inhibition against AChE; IC50 = 47.33 ± 0.02 nM and 51.36 ± 0.04 nM and moderate inhibition against BuChE; IC50 = 159.43 ± 0.72 nM and 153.3 ± 0.74 nM respectively. In the enzyme kinetics study, the compound BS-10 displayed non-competitive inhibition of AChE with Ki = 8 nM. Respective compounds BS-10 and BS-22 inhibited AChE-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation in thioflavin T-assay at 10 μM and 20 μM, but BS-10 at 10 μM and 20 μM concentrations are found more potent than BS-22. In addition, the aggregation properties were determined by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) and was found that BS-10 and BS-22 could significantly inhibit self-induced as well as AChE-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation. The effect of compounds (BS-10 and BS-22) on the viability of MC65 neuroblastoma cells and their capability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in PAMPA-BBB were further studied. Further, in silico approach was applied to analyze physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties of the designed compounds via the SwissADME and PreADMET server. Hence, the novel phenylsulfonyl-pyrimidine carboxylate derivatives can act as promising leads in the development of AChE inhibitors and Aβ disaggregator for the treatment of AD. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Piperine is an alkaloid that has extensive pharmacological activity and impacts other active substances bioavailability due to inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, stimulation of amino acid transporters and P-glycoprotein inhibition. Low solubility and the associated low bioavailability of piperine limit its potential. The combination of piperine with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) causes a significant increase in its solubility and, consequently, an increase in permeability through gastrointestinal tract membranes and the blood–brain barrier. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to characterize interactions between piperine and HP-β-CD. The observed physicochemical changes should be combined with the process of piperine and CD system formation. Importantly, with an increase in solubility and permeability of piperine as a result of interaction with CD, it was proven to maintain its biological activity concerning the antioxidant potential (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate assay), inhibition of enzymes essential for the inflammatory process and for neurodegenerative changes (hyaluronidase, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase). © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={A series of novel C4-C7-tethered biscoumarin derivatives (12a–e) linked through piperazine moiety was designed, synthesized, and evaluated biological/therapeutic potential. Biscoumarin 12d was found to be the most effective inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE, IC50 = 6.30 µM) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, IC50 = 49 µM). Detailed molecular modelling studies compared the accommodation of ensaculin (well-established coumarin derivative tested in phase I of clinical trials) and 12d in the human recombinant AChE (hAChE) active site. The ability of novel compounds to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) was predicted with a positive outcome for compound 12e. The antiproliferative effects of newly synthesized biscoumarin derivatives were tested in vitro on human lung carcinoma cell line (A549) and normal colon fibroblast cell line (CCD-18Co). The effect of derivatives on cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, quantification of cell numbers and viability, colony-forming assay, analysis of cell cycle distribution and mitotic activity. Intracellular localization of used derivatives in A549 cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Derivatives 12d and 12e showed significant antiproliferative activity in A549 cancer cells without a significant effect on normal CCD-18Co cells. The inhibition of hAChE/human recombinant BChE (hBChE), the antiproliferative activity on cancer cells, and the ability to cross the BBB suggest the high potential of biscoumarin derivatives. Beside the treatment of cancer, 12e might be applicable against disorders such as schizophrenia, and 12d could serve future development as therapeutic agents in the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={This study examined the modulatory effect of pigeon pea-wheat biscuits on lipid profile, lipid peroxidation level, α-glucosidase, and butyrylcholinesterase activities in type-2 diabetic patients. Composite flours were formulated using pigeon pea (PP) and wheat flour (WF) in ratio 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. Sixty diabetic patients (DP) were treated with biscuit samples and the effect of the biscuits on the serum lipid profile, α-glucosidase, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities were evaluated. The result revealed that total cholesterol ranged from [100-PP (13.94 ± 1.05 mg/dl)-REF (40.46 ± 3.09 mg/dl)]; triglyceride [100-PP (28.00 ± 1.14)-REF (115.00 ± 7.05)], low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) [100-PP (0.75 ± 0.30)-REF (13.30 ± 2.04)], high-density lipoprotein level(HDL-C) [REF (4.16 ± 0.49)-100-PP (7.59 ± 1.62)], LDL-C/HDL-C [100-PP (0.098 ± 0.01)-REF (8.72 ± 1.20)]. Alanine aminotransferase [CAB (3.10 ± 0.51 U/L)-REF (6.90 ± 0.84 U/L)]; aspartate aminotransferase [100-PP (9.50 ± 0.61 U/L)-REF (19.75 ± 1.50 U/L)]; alkaline phosphate (ALP) [CAB (26.99 ± 2.13 U/L)-BASELINE (UT) (92.40 ± 5.41 U/L]. α-glucosidase [100-PP (1.20 ± 0.07)-REF (0.37 ± 0.02)] and BChE [100-PP (1.12 ± 0.09)-REF (1.30 ± 0.01)] and Malondialdehyde [100-PP (0.33 ± 0.08)-REF (0.37 ± 0.04)]. 100-PP had an outstanding antihyperlipidemic potentials, not injurious to liver and might serve as good functional food that could help in preventing the risk of developing heart coronary disease, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Practical applications: This study provides vital information on the possible effect of pigeon pea-wheat biscuits on the serum lipid profile and peroxidation levels, α-glucosidase and butyrylcholinesterase of diabetic patients. The biscuits produced had lowering effect on cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein but improved high-density lipoprotein. All the biscuits have good lipid profile which may lower the risk of developing coronary heart diseases and vascular heart diseases in diabetes. However, 100-PP biscuit had an outstanding antihyperlipidemia action on the serum lipid levels of the patients. Also, it had the highest α-glucosidase, MDA, and BChE inhibitory potential. ALT, AST, and ALP serum activities of the patient's serum were greatly improved after treatment with the biscuits. 100-PP could lower the risk of developing heart coronary disease, atherosclerosis, and stroke. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={The present study demonstrates a simple approach to enhancing thermal stability of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by using natural polymers. Analysis of thermal inactivation of the tetrameric BChE in starch and gelatin gels at 50–64◦C showed that thermal inactivation followed second-order kinetics and involved two alternating processes of BChE inactivation, which occurred at different rates (fast and slow processes). The activation enthalpy ∆H# and the activation entropy ∆S# for BChE in starch and gelatin gels were evaluated. The values of ∆H# for the fast and the slow thermal inactivation of BChE in starch gel were 61 ± 3, and 22 ± 2 kcal/mol, respectively, and the values of ∆S# were 136 ± 12 and −2.03 ± 0.05 cal·K−1·mol−1, respectively. Likewise, the values of ∆H# for BChE in gelatin gel were 58 ± 6 and 109 ± 11 kcal/mol, and the values of ∆S# were 149 ± 16 and 262 ± 21 cal·K−1·mol−1, respectively. The values of the activation parameters obtained in this study suggest that starch gel produced a stronger stabilizing effect on BChE exposed to elevated temperatures over long periods compared with gelatin gel. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The phenothiazine dye, methylene blue, is reported to be an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Inhibitors of these enzymes are established medications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, whilst methylene blue has been investigated for its potential to slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Based on these observations, 31 dye compounds that are structurally related to methylene blue were evaluated as inhibitors of human AChE and equine BuChE. This study attempted to derive structure–activity relationships for the inhibition of AChE and BuChE by dye compounds, whilst discovering good potency inhibitors amongst the dyes. The results showed that several dyes exhibit good potency AChE (11 compounds) and BuChE (15 compounds) inhibition with IC50 &lt; 10 µM. Methylene green (IC50 = 0.467 µM) and new methylene blue N (IC50 = 0.799 µM) were found to be particularly potent AChE inhibitors, whilst acridine orange (IC50 = 0.220 µM), 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue (IC50 = 0.277 µM), acridine yellow G (IC50 = 0.509 µM), Nile blue (IC50 = 0.678 µM) and pyronin B (IC50 = 0.946 µM) proved to be highly potent BuChE inhibitors. These dye compounds thus exhibit improved inhibition compared to methylene blue [IC50(AChE) = 2.74 μM; IC50(BuChE) = 2.27 μM]. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Producing recombinant proteins in transgenic plant cell suspension cultures in bioreactors provides controllability, reproducibility, scalability, and low-cost production, although low yields remain the major challenge. The studies on scaling-up to pilot-scale bioreactors, especially in conventional stainless-steel stirred tank bioreactors (STB), to produce recombinant proteins in plant cell suspension cultures are very limited. In this study, we scaled-up the production of rice recombinant butyrylcholinesterase (rrBChE), a complex hydrolase enzyme that can be used to prophylactically and therapeutically treat against organophosphorus nerve agents and pesticide exposure, from metabolically regulated transgenic rice cell suspension cultures in a 40-L pilot-scale STB. Employing cyclical operation together with a simplified-process operation (controlling gas sparging rate rather than dissolved oxygen and allowing natural sugar depletion) identified in lab-scale (5 L) bioreactor studies, we found a consistent maximum total active rrBChE production level of 46–58 µg/g fresh weight in four cycles over 82 days of semicontinuous operation. Additionally, maintaining the overall volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) in the pilot-scale STB to be equivalent to the lab-scale STB improves the maximum total active rrBChE production level and the maximum volumetric productivity to 85 µg/g fresh weight and 387 µg L−1 day−1, respectively, which are comparable to the lab-scale culture. Here, we demonstrate pilot-scale bioreactor performance using a metabolically regulated transgenic rice cell culture for long-term, reproducible, and sustained production of rrBChE. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD), is among the most growing neurodegenerative diseases, which is mainly caused by the acetylcholine neurotransmitter loss in the hippocampus and cortex. Emerging of the dual Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors has increased for treating Alzheimer disease. In this study, we would like to report the design and synthesis of a new sequence of 1-benzyl-4-((4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)methyl) pyridin-1-ium derivatives (BOPs) assessed as BuChE and AChE inhibitors.

Among all synthesized compounds, 1-(3-bromobenzyl)-3-((4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)methyl) pyridin-1-ium bromide (BOP-1) was found to be the most active compound with dual activity for inhibition of AChE (IC50 = 5.90 ± 0.07μM), and BuChE (IC50 = 6.76 ± 0.04μM) and 1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-3-((6,7-dimethoxy-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)methyl) pyridin-1-ium chloride (BOP-8) showed the highest AChE inhibitory activity (IC50s = 1.11 ± 0.09 μM).

abstract={The objective of the present study was to evaluate the renal function of rural workers in a city of northeastern Brazil. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 208 workers in Boquim, Sergipe, Brazil. Renal function markers and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were evaluated and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined. The sample consisted mainly of illiterate males with a low usage of personal protective equipment and no training. Approximately 40% had some level of renal failure. Relative risk (1.59) of GFR alteration was higher in workers with more than 5 yr of exposure, mainly to organophosphates. Workers more than 60 yr of age presented a 17.06 greater risk for manifesting acute intoxication. Butyrylcholinesterase reduction was associated with reports of intoxication (relative risk of 11.36). We concluded that exposure to pesticides represented a risk factor for the development of nephrotoxic effects and alteration of renal function, which reinforced the need to implement measures to protect rural workers.

abstract={BACKGROUND: Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are the most extended current chronic diseases and also Alzheimer pathology which is a progressive degenerative neurological disorder. Therefore, finding effective enzyme inhibitors responsible for the development of these diseases are essential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fruit purée (Cydonia oblonga, Ziziphus jujube and Malus domestica) and pomegranate juice cultivar (‘Mollar de Elche’ and ‘Wonderful’) of dried pomegranate sheets (DS) on the inhibition of enzymes associated with metabolic (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase activity), and neurological disorder (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity). Quality properties (colour coordinates, texture properties and sensory characteristics) of DS were also studied. In addition, it was researched the effect of storage conditions (4 months at 4 and 20 °C) on phenolic content. RESULTS: DS from jujube had the highest antioxidant capacity and were characterized by the highest storage stability with respect to phenolic compounds. The α-amylase and α-glucosidase half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50, in mg mL−1) inhibition of DS ranged from 107 to 216 and from 55.2 to values indicating no effect, respectively. The inhibition toward pancreatic lipase (IC50 &lt; 5 mg mL−1), acetylcholinesterase (ranged 9.15–22.2%) and butyrylcholinesterase (ranged 20.6–48.6%) was increased with the presence of total flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids content (identifying mainly in DS from quinces). It is noteworthy that none of the samples presented off-flavour notes, supporting the high quality of the products. CONCLUSION: DS can be an innovative supplement to a diet as a snack used in the prevention of neurological changes and disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={A series of six N-carbamimidoyl-4-(3-substituted phenylureido)benzenesulfonamide derivatives were synthesized by reaction of sulfaguanidine with aromatic isocyanates. In vitro and in silico inhibitory effects of the novel ureido-substituted sulfaguanidine derivatives were investigated by spectrophotometric methods for α-glycosidase (α-GLY), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). N-Carbamimidoyl-4-{[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)carbamoyl]amino}benzene-1-sulfonamide (2f) showed AChE and BChE inhibitory effects, with KI values of 515.98±45.03 nM and 598.47±59.18 nM, respectively, while N-carbamimidoyl-4-{[(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyl]amino}benzene-1-sulfonamide (2e) showed strong α-GLY inhibitory effect, with KI values of 103.94±13.06 nM. The antidiabetic effects of the novel synthesized compounds are higher than their anti-Alzheimer's effects, because the inhibition effect of the compounds on the α-GLY with diabetic enzyme is greater than the effect on esterase enzymes. Indeed, inhibition of the metabolic enzymes is important for the treatment of DM and AD. © 2021 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland},

abstract={The mechanism of toxic action for organophosphates (OPs) is the persistent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) resulting in accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent hyperstimulation of the nervous system. Organophosphates display a wide range of acute toxicities. Differences in the OP's chemistries results in differences in the compound's metabolism and toxicity. Acute toxicities of OPs appear to be principally dependent on compound specific efficiencies of detoxication, and less dependent upon efficiencies of bioactivation and sensitivity of AChE. Serine esterases, such as carboxylesterase (CaE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), play a prominent role in OP detoxication. Organophosphates can stoichiometrically inhibit these enzymes, removing OPs from circulation thus providing protection for the target enzyme, AChE. This in vitro study investigated age-related sensitivity of AChE, BChE and CaE to twelve structurally different OPs in rat tissues. Sensitivity of esterases to these OPs was assessed by inhibitory concentration 50s (IC50s). The OPs displayed a wide range of inhibitory potency toward AChE with IC50s in the low nM-μM range with no differences among ages; however, the CaE IC50s generally increased with age reflecting greater protection in adults. These results suggest age-related differences in acute toxicities of OPs in mammals are primarily a result of their detoxication capacities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide that acts selectively as an agonist on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is used for crop protection worldwide, as well as for non-agricultural uses. Imidacloprid systemic accumulation in food is an important source of imidacloprid exposure. Due to the undisputable need for investigations of imidacloprid toxicity in non-target species, we evaluated the effects of a 28-day oral exposure to low doses of imidacloprid (0.06 mg/kg b. w./day, 0.8 mg/kg b. w./day and 2.25 mg/kg b. w./day) on cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress responses and primary DNA damage in the blood and brain tissue of male Wistar rats. Exposure to imidacloprid did not cause significant changes in total cholinesterase, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities in plasma and brain tissue. Reactive oxygen species levels and lipid peroxidation increased significantly in the plasma of rats treated with the lowest dose of imidacloprid. Activities of glutathione-peroxidase in plasma and brain and superoxide dismutase in erythrocytes increased significantly at the highest applied dose. High performance liquid chromatography with UV diode array detector revealed the presence of imidacloprid in the plasma of all the treated animals and in the brain of the animals treated with the two higher doses. The alkaline comet assay results showed significant peripheral blood leukocyte damage at the lowest dose of imidacloprid and dose-dependent brain cell DNA damage. Oral 28-day exposure to low doses of imidacloprid in rats resulted in detectable levels of imidacloprid in plasma and brain tissue that directly induced DNA damage, particularly in brain tissue, with slight changes in plasma oxidative stress parameters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: This study sought to describe the phenotype and genotype characteristics of patients referred to our laboratory to undergo further assessment due to a suspicion of a prolonged effect of suxamethonium attributed to BChE deficiency. Methods: All patients referred to our laboratory from January 2016 to December 2019 due to the suspicion of a prolonged effect of suxamethonium were included in this study. The determination of BChE activity and genotyping using complete nucleotide sequencing of the entire complementary DNA-coding region with flanking intron–exon boundaries were completed. Results: During this four-year period, 58 patients were referred to our laboratory for the investigation of prolonged neuromuscular block due to BChE deficiency. Among them, 52 showed a BChE deficiency related to BCHE gene mutations. The most commonly detected genotype was compound homozygous atypical variant (p.Asp98Gly)/homozygous Kalow variant (p.Ala569Thr) (p.[Asp98Gly;Ala567Thr];[p.Asp98Gly;Ala567Thr]). Further, we recorded four new BCHE variants, which seem to be associated with prolonged post suxamethonium apnoea: p.(Trp205Cys), p.(Leu222His), p.(Glu469Gln), and p.(Lys276Ter). Conclusion: During a four-year period, among the 58 patients referred to our laboratory, we have found four new BCHE variants, which seem to be associated with prolonged post suxamethonium apnoea (p.(Trp205Cys), p.(Leu22His), p.(Glu469Gln), and p.(Lys276Ter)). © 2021 Société française d'anesthésie et de réanimation (Sfar)},

abstract={Biotherapeutics have achieved global economic success due to their high specificity towards their drug targets, providing exceptional safety and efficiency. The ongoing shift away from small molecule drugs towards biotherapeutics heightens the need to further improve the pharmacokinetics of these biological drugs. Three pervasive obstacles that limit the therapeutic capacity of biotherapeutics are proteolytic degradation, circulating half-life, and the development of anti-drug antibodies. These challenges can culminate in limited efficiency and consequently warrant the need for higher drug doses and more frequent administration. We have explored the coupling of biotherapeutics to long-lived and biocompatible red blood cells (RBCs) to address limited pharmacokinetics. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), for example, provides prophylactic protection against organophosphate nerve agents (OPNAs), yet the short circulation life of the drug requires extraordinary doses. Herein, we report the rapid and tunable chemical engineering of BChE to RBC membranes to create a cell-based delivery system that retains the enzyme activity and enhances stability. In a three-step process that first pre-modifies BChE with a cell-reactive polymer chain, primes the cells for engineering, and then grafts the conjugates to the cells, we attached over 2 million BChE molecules to the surface of each RBC without diminishing the bioscavenging capacity of the enzyme. Critically, this membrane-engineering approach was cell-tolerated with minimal hemolysis observed. These results provide strong evidence for the ability of engineered RBCs to serve as an enhanced biotherapeutic delivery vehicle. Statement of Significance: Organophosphate nerve agents (OPNAs) are one of the most lethal forms of chemical warfare. After exposure to OPNAs, a patient is given life-saving therapeutics, such as atropine and oxime. However, these drugs are limited, and the patient can still suffer from irreparable injuries. Given the toxicity of OPNAs, access to a prophylactic is vital. We have created an enhanced delivery system for prophylactic butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by engineering this biotherapeutic to the red blood cell (RBC) surface. In three simple steps that first pre-modifies BChE with a cell-reactive polymer, primes the cells for engineering, and then grafts the conjugates to the cells, we attached over 2 million BChE molecules to a single RBC while retaining the enzyme's activity and enhancing its stability. © 2021},

The new cyanopyridine derivatives showed Ki values in the range of 40.73 ± 6.54 to 87.05 ± 16.98 µM against AChE, 29.17 ± 4.88 to 124.03 ± 22.43 µM against BChE, and 3.66 ± 0.93 to 26.33 ± 5.05 µM against α-Gly.

Also, these cyanopyridine derivatives with the best inhibition score were docked into the active site of the indicated metabolic enzymes. Finally, molecular docking calculations were made to compare the biological activities of the compounds against AChE (−8.81 kcal/mol for molecule 11d), BChE (−3.52 kcal/mol for molecule 11d), and α-Gly (−2.98 kcal/mol for molecule 11a).

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants (suxamethonium or mivacurium) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene. Here, we report the characterization of four BCHE mutations associated with prolonged effect of suxamethonium (amino acid numbering based on the matured enzyme): p.20delValPheGlyGlyThrValThr, p.Leu88His, p.Ile140del and p.Arg386Cys. Expression of recombinant BCHE mutants, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how these mutations induce BChE deficiency. Three of the mutations studied (p.20delValPheGlyGlyThrValThr, p.Ile140del and p.Arg386Cys) lead to a “silent” BChE phenotype. Recombinant BCHE expression studies for these mutants revealed BChE activity levels comparable to untransfected cells. Only the last one (hBChE-L88H) presented BChE activity in the transfected cell culture medium. This BChE mutant (p.Leu88His) is associated with a lower kcat value compare to the wild-type enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations analyses suggest that a destabilization of a structure implicated in enzyme activity (Ω-loop) can explain the modification of the kinetic parameter of the mutated protein. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

Structures and models of both enzymes from various organisms, including rays, mice, and humans, are discussed to highlight key structural similarities in the active site gorges of the two enzymes, such as flexibility, binding site location, and function, as well as differences, such as gorge volume and binding site residue composition. Catalytic studies are also described, with an emphasis on the mechanism of acetylcholine hydrolysis by each enzyme and novel mutants that increase catalytic efficiency. The in-hibitory activities of myriad compounds have been computationally assessed, primarily through Monte Carlo‐based docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Pharmaceutical compounds examined herein include FDA‐approved therapeutics and their derivatives, as well as several other prescription drug derivatives. Cholinesterase interactions with both narcotics and organophos-phate compounds are discussed, with the latter focusing primarily on molecular recognition studies of potential therapeutic value and on improving our understanding of the reactivation of cholinester-ases that are bound to toxins. This review also explores the inhibitory properties of several other or-ganic and biological moieties, as well as advancements in virtual screening methodologies with re-spect to these enzymes. © 2021 by the authors.

BChE was inhibited by only methyl rosmarinate and kokusaginine (IC50 = 41.46 ± 2.83 and 61.40 ± 3.67 µg/mL, respectively). IC50 values for galantamine as the reference drug were 1.33 ± 0.11 µg/mL for AChE and 52.31 ± 3.04 µg/mL for BChE. Molecular docking experiments showed that the orientation of smilagenin and kokusaginine was mainly driven by the interactions with the peripheral anionic site (PAS) comprising residues of hAChE, while kokusaginine and methyl rosmarinate were able to access deeper into the active gorge in hBChE.

abstract={Lichen secondary metabolites are characterized by huge pharmacological potential. Our research focused on assessing the anticancer and neuroprotective activity of Hypogymnia physodes acetone extract (HP extract) and physodic acid, its major component. The antitumor properties were evaluated by cytotoxicity analysis using A-172, T98G, and U-138 MG glioblastoma cell lines and by hyaluronidase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition. The neuroprotective potential was examined using COX-2, tyrosinase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity tests. Moreover, the antioxidant potential of the tested substances was examined, and the chemical composition of the extract was analyzed. For physodic acid, the permeability through the blood–brain barrier using Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay for the Blood–Brain Barrier assay (PAMPA-BBB) was assessed. Our study shows that the tested substances strongly inhibited glioblastoma cell proliferation and hyaluronidase activity. Besides, HP extract diminished COX-2 and tyrosinase activity. However, the AChE and BChE inhibitory activity of HP extract and physodic acid were mild. The examined substances exhibited strong antioxidant activity. Importantly, we proved that physodic acid crosses the blood–brain barrier. We conclude that physodic acid and H. physodes should be regarded as promising agents with anticancer, chemopreventive, and neuroprotective activities, especially regarding the central nervous system diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Oxime reactivators of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) represent an integral part of standard antidote treatment of organophosphate poisoning. Oxime K869 is a novel bisquaternary non-symmetric pyridinium aldoxime with two pyridinium rings connected by a tetramethylene bridge where two chlorines modify the pyridinium ring bearing the oxime moiety. Based on in vitro assays, K869 is a potent AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) reactivator. For the investigation of the basic pharmacokinetic properties of K869 after its intramuscular application, new HPLC-UV and LC-MS/MS methods were developed and validated for its determination in rat body fluids and tissues. In this study, the SPE procedure for sample pretreatment was optimized as an alternative to routine protein precipitation widely used in oxime pharmacokinetics studies. K869 oxime is quickly absorbed into the central compartment reaching its maximum in plasma (39 ± 4 μg/mL) between 15 and 20 min. The majority of K869 was eliminated by kidneys via urine when compared with biliary excretion. However, only a limited amount of K869 (65 ± 4 ng/g of brain tissue) was found in the brain 30 min after oxime administration. Regarding the brain/plasma ratio calculated (less than 1%), the penetration of K869 into the brain did not exceed conventionally used oximes. © 2021 American Pharmacists Association®},

abstract={Although carbon nanotubes’ (CNTs) toxicity in different experimental systems (in vivo and in vitro) is known, little is known about the toxic effects of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on aquatic vertebrates. We herein investigated the potential impact of CNFs (1 and 10 mg/L) by using Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles as experimental model. CNFs were able to induce nutritional deficit in animals after 48-h exposure to them, and this finding was inferred by reductions observed in body concentrations of total soluble carbohydrates, total proteins, and triglycerides. The increased production of hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in tadpoles exposed to CNFs has suggested REDOX homeostasis change into oxidative stress. This process was correlated to the largest number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in the blood of these animals. On the other hand, the increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activity has suggested that the antioxidant system of animals exposed to CNFs was not enough to maintain REDOX balance. In addition, CNFs induced increase in acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity, as well as changes in the number of neuromasts evaluated on body surface (which is indicative of the neurotoxic effect of nanomaterials on the assessed model system). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the impact of CNFs on amphibians; therefore, it broadened our understanding about ecotoxicological risks associated with their dispersion in freshwater ecosystems and possible contribution to the decline in the populations of anurofauna species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The members of the genus Inula have been widely used in traditional medicinal. In the present study, 11 Inula species were investigated for their phytochemical composition, antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory effects. While quinic acid was the principal compound in I. anatolica, I. britannica, I. inuloides, I. oculus-christi, I. peacockiana, I. sechmenii, I. thapsoides and I. viscidula extracts (22.43–42.02 mg/g dry extract (DE)), I. aucheriana and I. discoidea extracts contained rutin as their most abundant compound (23.28 and 79.10 mg/g extract, respectively). Interestingly, all the Inula extracts were active inhibitors of the five key clinical enzymes (acetylcholinesterase (3.56–5.13 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g), butyrylcholinesterase (1.49–7.34 mg GALAE/g), tyrosinase (112.31–122.13 mg kojic acid equivalent (KAE)/g), α-glucosidase (0.77–2.08 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g) and α-amylase (0.73–0.90 mmol ACAE/g)). Furthermore, the extracts were observed to exhibit substantial antioxidant capacity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH): 58.99–188.22 mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g); 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS): 90.51–220.97 mg TE/g; cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC): 169.88–460.53 mg TE/g; ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP): 81.57–237.99 mg TE/g; metal chelating activity: 8.31–25.39 mg ethylenediamine tetraacetate equivalent (EDTAE)/g; phosphomolybdenum: 1.55–2.49 mmol TE/g).

abstract={A library of novel 4‐{[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]amino}‐2‐hydroxybenzoic acid amides was designed and synthesized in order to provide potential acetyl‐ and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE/BChE) inhibitors; the in vitro inhibitory profile and selectivity index were specified. Benzyl (3‐hydroxy‐4‐{[2‐(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]carbamoyl}phenyl)carbamate was the best AChE in-hibitor with the inhibitory concentration of IC50 = 36.05 μM in the series, while benzyl {3‐hydroxy‐4‐[(2‐methoxyphenyl)carbamoyl]phenyl}‐carbamate was the most potent BChE inhib-itor (IC50 = 22.23 μM) with the highest selectivity for BChE (SI = 2.26). The cytotoxic effect was evaluated in vitro for promising AChE/BChE inhibitors. The newly synthesized adducts were subjected to the quantitative shape comparison with the generation of an averaged pharmacophore pattern. Noticeably, three pairs of fairly similar fluorine/bromine‐containing compounds can po-tentially form the activity cliff that is manifested formally by high structure–activity landscape index (SALI) numerical values. The molecular docking study was conducted for the most potent AChE/BChE inhibitors, indicating that the hydrophobic interactions were overwhelmingly generated with Gln119, Asp70, Pro285, Thr120, and Trp82 aminoacid residues, while the hydrogen bond (HB)‐donor ones were dominated with Thr120. π‐stacking interactions were specified with the Trp82 aminoacid residue of chain A as well. Finally, the stability of chosen liganded enzymatic systems was assessed using the molecular dynamic simulations. An attempt was made to explain the noted differences of the selectivity index for the most potent molecules, especially those bearing unsubstituted and fluorinated methoxy group. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Introduction: Key-enzyme inhibition is a recent approach for the treatment of some health disorders, including diabetes, skin hyperpigmentation, Alzheimer's disease, and some microbial infections. Looking for potential natural multi-target inhibitors, flavonoid-rich extracts from the peel of Ficus carica fruits were simultaneously tested against five enzymes and various methods were used to evaluate their antioxidant activity. Methods: Extracts from peels from F. carica cultivars (Bakor Noir, Bouankik, Azenjer, and Tazegaght) were prepared using methanol acidified by 5% citric acid. Inhibitory activities of extracts at 10 mg/mL were measured in vitro against α-glucosidase, tyrosinase, urease, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase. Also, the antioxidant activity was evaluated using free radical scavenging, iron and copper chelating, and reducing assays. Results: Extracts were efficient in inhibiting tyrosinase and α-glucosidase (IC50 values from 0.09 to 0.45, and 1.18 to 3.38 mg/mL, respectively). However, a weak inhibition was observed against urease and cholinesterases. Among the antioxidant activities studied, extracts were more efficient for copper chelation and radical scavenging (IC50 values from 0.05 to 0.13, and 0.30 to 1.33 mg/mL, respectively). Phytochemical analysis revealed the extraction of large quantities of flavonoids (up to 50.4 mg/g of peels), mainly flavonols (up to 81% of total flavonoids). Given the specific extract composition, including two fractions (flavonoids and citric acid), a strong synergy was observed for enzyme inhibition and metal chelation. Conclusion: Flavonoid-rich extracts from F. carica could be considered as multifunctional bioactive ingredients to be used in anti-hyperglycemic and skin-whitening pharmaceutical formulations. © 2020},

abstract={The interaction of copper(II) with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug sodium meclofenamate (Na-mclf) in the presence or absence of the nitrogen-donor co-ligands pyridine (py) or 2,2′-bipyridylamine (bipyam), yielded the novel Cu(II) complexes [Cu2(mclf-O,O′)4(MeOH)2]·2MeOH (1·2MeOH), [Cu(mclf-O)2(py)3]·H2O·0.5MeOH (2·H2O·0.5MeOH) and [Cu(mclf-O,O′)2(bipyam)] (3). The characterization of the complexes was achieved by various techniques, including single-crystal X-ray crystallography. In order to study the binding mode and strength of the complexes to calf-thymus (CT) DNA, various techniques were employed which suggested intercalation between the DNA-bases as the most possible interaction mode. Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (EB) revealed the ability of the complexes to displace the EB from the EB-DNA adduct, verifying the intercalative binding mode. The affinity of the complexes to bovine and human serum albumin proteins (SAs) was investigated by fluorescence emission spectroscopy and the corresponding binding constants bear relatively high values, showing that the complexes bind tightly and possibly reversibly to SAs. The antioxidant activity of the complexes against 1,1-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radicals and the ability to reduce H2O2 proved to be of significant magnitude. The in vitro inhibitory activity against the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) was evaluated, in order to assess the anticholinergic ability of the complexes, which appeared promising. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Abstract: A series of Fe(II), Ni(II), and Pd(II) complexes were prepared with a novel Schiff base ligand containing pyridine moiety. The prepared compounds were characterized using FT-IR, 1H and 13 C NMR, UV–Vis, powder XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, mass spectra, magnetic susceptibility, and elemental analysis. The coordination geometry of Fe(II) and Ni(II) complexes were octahedral, where Fe(II) and Ni(II) metal ions were coordinated by an oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, a nitrogen atom of the azomethine moiety, and a phenolic oxygen atom. The Pd(II) complex had square planar geometry. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for their biochemical properties, including enzyme inhibition and antioxidant activities. According to the in vitro DPPH and FRAP antioxidant methods, the Schiff base ligand and its Fe(II)/Pd(II) complexes showed close antioxidant activities against the standards (BHA, BHT, ascorbic acid, and α-tocopherol). Enzyme inhibitions of the metal complexes were investigated against glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes. The best inhibition value (Ki) was observed for the Ni(II) complex against GST (2.63 ± 0.04 µM). Also, the Pd(II) complex showed the best inhibition value (10.17 ± 1.88 µM) against AChE. Molecular docking specified significant interactions at the active pockets of respective target enzymes. The Ni(II) complex exhibited good binding affinity against both BChE (− 9.0 kcal/mol and 9.36 ± 2.03 µM) and GST (− 7.0 kcal/mol and 2.63 ± 0.04 µM) enzymes.

abstract={Specimens of two endemic cyprinids, Squalius laietanus (Catalan chub) and Barbus meridionalis (Mediterranean barbel), were sampled from a reference site in a small stream of the Ripoll River (NW Mediterranean) outside of their reproductive season. Biomarkers involved in xenobiotic-mediated responses were individually contrasted in fish of both species and 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) analysed in muscle to reveal bioaccumulation trends. The parameters were in muscle: cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD and BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT). All markers are considered adaptive defence mechanism to face stress. Sensitivity to a model pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted in vitro in muscular acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to reveal species sensitivity to neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities related to protective mechanisms such as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the antioxidant defences GR and GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher in barbel while anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ between the two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS were higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub (lower IC50) which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic efficiency of CE. All these former biochemical particularities are discussed in terms of fish ecological performance in front of anthropogenic stressors. © 2020},

abstract={In the study, two novel compounds along with two new compounds were isolated from Grewia optiva. The novel compounds have never been reported in any plant source, whereas the new compounds are reported for the first time from the studied plant. The four compounds were characterized as: 5,5,7,7,11,13-hexamethyl-2-(5-methylhexyl)icosahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]chrysen-9-ol (IX), docosanoic acid (X), methanetriol mano formate (XI) and 2,2'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-methylbutanoic acid (XII). The anticholinesterase, antidiabetic, and antioxidant potentials of these compounds were determined using standard protocols. All the isolated compounds exhibited a moderate-to-good degree of activity against acetylcholinesterases (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). However, compound XII was particularly effective with IC50 of 55 μg/mL (against AChE) and 60 μg/mL (against BChE), and this inhibitory activity is supported by in silico docking studies. The same compound was also effective against DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals with IC50 values of 60 and 62 μg/mL, respectively. The compound also significantly inhibited the activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase in vitro. The IC50 values for inhibition of the two enzymes were recorded as 90 and 92 μg/mL, respectively. The in vitro potentials of compound XII to treat Alzheimer's disease (in terms of AchE and BChE inhibition), diabetes (in terms of α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition), and oxidative stress (in terms of free radical scavenging) suggest further in vivo investigations of the compound for assessing its efficacy, safety profile, and other parameters to proclaim the compound as a potential drug candidate.},

abstract={This study aimed to establish a rapid in vitro plant regeneration method from rhizome buds of Kaempferia parviflora to obtain the valuable secondary metabolites with antioxidant and enzyme inhibition properties. The disinfection effect of silver oxide nanoparticles (AgO NPs) on rhizome and effects of plant growth regulators on shoot multiplication and subsequent rooting were investigated. Surface sterilization of rhizome buds with sodium hypochlorite was insufficient to control contamination. However, immersing rhizome buds in 100 mg L−1 AgO NPs for 60 min elim-inated contamination without affecting the survival of explants. The number of shoots (12.2) pro-duced per rhizome bud was higher in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 8 μM of 6‐ Benzyladenine (6‐BA) and 0.5 μM of Thidiazuron (TDZ) than other treatments. The highest number of roots (24), with a mean root length of 7.8 cm and the maximum shoot length (9.8 cm), were obtained on medium MS with 2 μM of Indole‐3‐butyric acid (IBA). A survival rate of 98% was attained when plantlets of K. parviflora were acclimatized in a growth room. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) was used to determine the chemical profile of K. parviflora leaf extracts. Results showed that several biologically active flavonoids reported in rhizomes were also present in leaf tissues of both in vitro cultured and ex vitro (greenhouse‐grown) plantlets of K. parviflora. We found 40 and 36 compounds in in vitro cultured and ex vitro grown leaf samples, respectively. Greenhouse leaves exhibited more potent antioxidant activities than leaves from in vitro cultures. A higher acetylcholinesterase inhibitory ability was obtained for greenhouse leaves (1.07 mg/mL). However, leaves from in vitro cultures exhibited stronger butyrylcholinesterase in-hibitory abilities. These results suggest that leaves of K. parviflora, as major byproducts of black ginger cultivation, could be used as valuable alternative sources for extracting bioactive compounds. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. is extensively used in traditional medicinal systems by various cultures. Despite its frequent use in traditional medicine, there is still a paucity of scientific information on T. asiatica growing on the tropical island of Mauritius. Therefore, the present study was designed to appraise the pharmacological and phytochemical profile of extracts (methanol, ethyl acetate and water) and essential oil obtained from aerial parts of T. asiatica. Biological investigation involved the evaluation of in vitro antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory potentials. The chemical profile of the EO was determined using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, while for the extracts, the total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid content were quantified as well as their individual phenolic compounds by LC/MS/MS. Quinic acid, fumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, quercitrin and isoquercitrin were the main compounds in the extracts. Highest total phenolic (82.5±0.94 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE/g)) and flavonoid (43.8±0.31 mg rutin equivalent (RE/g)) content were observed for the methanol extract. The GC/MS analysis has shown the presence of 26 compounds with linalool (30.9 %), linalyl acetate (20.9 %) and β-phellandrene (7.9 %) being most abundant components in the EO. The extracts and EO showed notable antioxidant properties, with the methanol extract proved to be superior source of antioxidant compounds. Noteworthy anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and anti-butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) effects were recorded for the tested samples, while only the methanol and ethyl acetate extracts were active against tyrosinase. With respect to antidiabetic effects, the extracts and EO were potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase, while modest activity was recorded against α-amylase. Docking results showed that linalyl acetate has the highest affinity to interact with the active site of BChE with docking score of −6.25 kcal/mol. The findings amassed herein act as a stimulus for further investigations of this plant as a potential source of bioactive compounds which can be exploited as phyto-therapeutics. © 2021 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland},

abstract={Neurodegenerative diseases, for example Alzheimer's, are perceived as driven by hereditary, cellular, and multifaceted biochemical actions. Numerous plant products, for example flavonoids, are documented in studies for having the ability to pass the blood-brain barrier and moderate the development of such illnesses. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has achieved importance in the drug discovery world; innovative developments in the aspects of structure identification and characterization, bio-computational science, and molecular biology have added to the preparation of new medications towards these ailments. In this study we evaluated nine flavonoid compounds identified from three medicinal plants, namely T. diversifolia, B. sapida, and I. gabonensis for their inhibitory role on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, using pharmacophore modeling, auto-QSAR prediction, and molecular studies, in comparison with standard drugs. The results indicated that the pharmacophore models produced from structures of AChE, BChE and MAO could identify the active compounds, with a recuperation rate of the actives found near 100% in the complete ranked decoy database. Moreso, the robustness of the virtual screening method was accessed by well-established methods including enrichment factor (EF), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), Boltzmann-enhanced discrimination of receiver operating characteristic (BEDROC), and area under accumulation curve (AUAC). Most notably, the compounds' pIC50 values were predicted by a machine learning-based model generated by the AutoQSAR algorithm. The generated model was validated to affirm its predictive model. The best models achieved for AChE, BChE and MAO were models kpls_radial_17 (R2 = 0.86 and Q2 = 0.73), pls_38 (R2 = 0.77 and Q2 = 0.72), kpls_desc_44 (R2 = 0.81 and Q2 = 0.81) and these externally validated models were utilized to predict the bioactivities of the lead compounds. The binding affinity results of the ligands against the three selected targets revealed that luteolin displayed the highest affinity score of -9.60 kcal/mol, closely followed by apigenin and ellagic acid with docking scores of -9.60 and -9.53 kcal/mol, respectively. The least binding affinity was attained by gallic acid (-6.30 kcal/mol). The docking scores of our standards were -10.40 and -7.93 kcal/mol for donepezil and galanthamine, respectively. The toxicity prediction revealed that none of the flavonoids presented toxicity and they all had good absorption parameters for the analyzed targets. Hence, these compounds can be considered as likely leads for drug improvement against the same.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an obstinate and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, mainly characterized by cognitive decline. Increasing number of AD patients and the lack of promising treatment strategies demands novel therapeutic agents to combat various disease pathologies in AD. Recent progresses in understanding molecular mechanisms in AD helped researchers to streamline the various therapeutic approaches. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity has emerged as one of the potential treatment strategies. The present study discusses the identification of two potent AChE inhibitors (ZINC11709541 and ZINC11996936) from ZINC database through conventional in silico approaches and their in vitro validations. These inhibitors have strong preferences towards AChE than butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and didn't evoke any significant reduction in the cell viability of HEK-293 cells and primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, promising neuroprotective properties has also been displayed against glutamate induced excitotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. The present study proposes two potential drug lead compounds for the treatment of AD, that can be used for further studies and preclinical evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) include nerve agents and insecticides that potently inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an essential enzyme found throughout the nervous system. High exposure levels to OPs lead to seizures, cardiac arrest, and death if left untreated. Oximes are a critical piece to the therapeutic regimen which remove the OP from the inhibited AChE and restore normal cholinergic function. The current oximes 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and obidoxime (OBD) have two drawbacks: lack of broad spectrum protection against multiple OP structures and poor brain penetration to protect against OP central neurotoxicity. An alternative strategy to enhance therapy is reactivation of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). BChE is stoichiometrically inhibited by OPs with no apparent toxic result. Inhibition of BChE in the serum followed by reactivation could create a pseudo-catalytic scavenger allowing numerous regenerations of BChE to detoxify circulating OP molecules before they can reach target AChE. BChE in serum from rats, guinea pigs or humans was screened for the reactivation potential of our novel substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes, plus 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and OBD (100μM) in vitro after inhibition by highly relevant surrogates of sarin, VX, and cyclosarin, and also DFP, and the insecticidal active metabolites paraoxon, phorate-oxon, and phorate-oxon sulfoxide. Novel oxime 15 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited rat serum BChE while novel oxime 20 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited human serum BChE. All tested oximes were poor reactivators of OP-inhibited guinea pig serum BChE. The bis-pyridinium oximes were poor BChE reactivators overall. BChE reactivation may be an additional mechanism to attenuate OP toxicity and contribute to therapeutic efficacy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Forty different phytochemicals were identified, and twenty of them were quantified, whereas the main constituents were dihydro α ionol-O-[arabinosil(1-6) glucoside] (133 mg/g), dihydro β ionol-O-[arabinosil(1-6) glucoside] (80 mg/g), β-sitosterol (49 mg/g), and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside (26 mg/g). C. hirtus was extracted with different solvents-namely, water, methanol, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate-and the extracts were assayed using different in vitro tests. The methanolic extracts presented the highest 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values. All the tested extracts exhibited inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), with a higher activity observed for dichloromethane (AChE: 5.03 and BChE: 16.41 mgGALAE/g), while the methanolic extract showed highest impact against tyrosinase (49.83 mgKAE/g).

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an essential human cholinesterase relevant to liver conditions and neurodegenerative diseases, which makes it a pivotal biomarker of health. It therefore remains challenging and highly desired to elaborate efficient chemical tools for BChE with simple operations and satisfactory working performance. In this work, a background-free detection strategy was built by virtue of the judicious coupling of a specific BChE-enzymatic reaction and in situ cyclization. High sensitivity with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.075 μg/mL could be readily achieved from the blank background and the as-produced emissive indicators, and the specific reaction site contributed to the high selectivity over other bio-species even acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In addition to the multifaceted spectral experiments to verify the sensing mechanism, this work assumed comprehensive studies on the application. The bio-investigation ranged from cells to an organism, declaring a noteworthy prospect in disease diagnosis, especially for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common neurodegenerative disease with over-expressed BChE. Moreover, its excellent work for inhibition efficacy elucidation was also proved with the accuracy IC50 of tacrine for BChE (8.6 nM), giving rise to an expanded application for trace pesticide determination. ©},

abstract={Hypericum triquetrifolium and H. neurocalycinum were evaluated for their phytochemical content and in vitro bioactivity. NMR analyses were performed on the methanol extract of the aerial parts of H. triquetrifolium to establish the main classes of phytoconstituents. Then, LC-DAD-MSn analyses were performed in order to compare the composition of aerial parts and roots extracts of both Hypericum species, obtained using either methanol or water as solvents. Results, processed using multivariate data analysis, showed a significantly higher phenolic content of methanol extracts compared to water extracts, while minor qualitative differences were observed between the two. Distinctive flavonoid and PAC patterns were observed for H. triquetrifolium and H. neurocalycinum, and specific compounds were exclusively detected in one or the other species. Specifically, the phloroglucinols 7-epiclusianone, hyperfirin and hyperforin were present only in H. neurocalycinum, while hyperforin was detected only in H. triquetrifolium. Extracts were assayed using different in vitro tests to evaluate their antioxidant properties and their inhibitory activity against several enzymes, showing significant antioxidant and metal chelating activities. Furthermore, inhibitory properties against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and tyrosinase were observed. Multivariate approaches were used to correlate biological data with the phytochemical composition of the different extracts. The results, showing positive correlations between specific chemical constituents and the measured bioactivities, represent preliminary data that could guide future studies aimed at isolating bioactive constituents from H. neurocalycinum and H. triquetrifolium for further pharmacological evaluations. © Copyright © 2021 Dall’Acqua, Ak, Sinan, Elbasan, Ferrarese, Sut, Yıldıztugay, Peron, Schievano, Nancy Picot-Allain, Mahomoodally and Zengin.},

Selected samples, coming from fresh and defrosted berries, submitted to different homogenization techniques combined with thermal and microwave treatments, had been previously analyzed in their polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity. In the present work, these homogenates were evaluated in relation to their enzymatic inhibition activity towards acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, α-amylase, α-glucosidase and tyrosinase. All these enzymes, involved in the onset of diabetes, and neurodegenerative and other chronic diseases, were modulated by the tested samples. The inhibitory effect on tyrosinase and cholinesterase was the most valuable. Antifungal activity against Candida albicans, recently shown to play a crucial role in human gut diseases as well as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease, was also shown in vitro and confirmed by the in vivo text on Galleria mellonella. Overall, the obtained results confirm once again the health potential of strawberries; however, the efficacy is dependent on high quality products submitted to correct processing flow charts.},

Compound 11 a and 11 g with piperazine containing acetamide and butyrylamide chains have shown equal potency to that of tacrine with IC50 values 0.71±0.04 and 1.01±0.03 μM, and 0.52±0.03 and 0.73±0.04 μM, against AChE and BuChE respectively when compared to standard tacrine with IC50 of 0.23±0.4 μM and 0.31±0.03, whereas rivastigmine showed 0.47±0.2 and 0.65±0.02 μM against AChE and BuChE, respectively. Also, some of the potent compounds were tested for liver toxicity and were found to be much safer than tacrine. Thus, these new tacrine analogs with five, six and seven membered ‘C’ rings have emerged as new cholinesterase inhibitors for further exploitation as anti-Alzheimer's agents. Docking studies of all the molecules disclosed close hydrogen bond interactions within the binding site. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={In this paper, a novel strategy for biosensing butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity is developed based on manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets to modulate the photoluminescence of thiamine (TH). The oxidase-like activity of MnO2 nanosheets enables them to catalyze the oxidation of non-fluorescent substrate TH to generate strong fluorescent thiochrome (TC). When the target BChE is introduced to form thiocholine in the presence of S-butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCh), MnO2 nanosheets are reduced by thiocholine to Mn2+, resulting in the loss of their oxidase-like activity and the reduction of TC fluorescence. Based on this, a BChE activity fluorescence biosensor is constructed utilizing the luminescence behavior variation of TH and the oxidase-like activity of MnO2 nanosheets. The fluorescence biosensor shows a sensitive response to BChE, and the detection limit reaches 0.036 U L−1. In addition, the feasibility of the biosensor in real samples analysis is studied with satisfactory results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Structural information of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and its variants associated with several diseases are discussed here. Pure human BChE has been proved safe and effective in treating organophosphorus (OPs) poisoning and has completed Phase 1 and 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety studies. The introduction of specific mutations into native BChE to endow it a self-reactivating property has gained much progress in producing effective OPs hydrolases. The hydrolysis ability of native BChE on cocaine has been confirmed but was blocked to clinical application due to poor PK properties. Several BChE mutants with elevated cocaine hydrolysis activity were published, some of which have shown safety and efficiency in treating cocaine addiction of human. The increased level of BChE in progressed Alzheimer's disease patients made it a promising target to elevate acetylcholine level and attenuate cognitive status. A variety of selective BChE inhibitors with high inhibitory activity published in recent years are reviewed here. BChE could influence the weight and insulin secretion and resistance of BChE knockout (KO) mice through hydrolyzing ghrelin. The BChE-ghrelin pathway could also regulate aggressive behaviors of BChE-KO mice. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) can serve as biochemical markers of various pathologies like liver disfunction and poisonings by nerve agents. Ellman’s assay is the standard spectrophotometric method to measure cholinesterase activity in clinical laboratories. The authors present a new colorimetric test to assess AChE and BChE activity in biological samples using chromogenic reagents, treated 3D-printed measuring pads and a smartphone camera as a signal detector. Multiwell pads treated with reagent substrates 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenyl acetate, indoxylacetate, ethoxyresorufin and methoxyresorufin were prepared and tested for AChE and BChE. In the experiments, 3D-printed pads containing indoxylacetate as a chromogenic substrate were optimal for analytical purposes. The best results were achieved using the red (R) channel, where the limit of detection was 4.05 µkat/mL for BChE and 4.38 µkat/mL for AChE using a 40 µL sample and a 60 min assay. The major advantage of this method is its overall simplicity, as samples are applied directly without any specific treatment or added reagents. The assay was also validated to the standard Ellman’s assay using human plasma samples. In conclusion, this smartphone camera-based colorimetric assay appears to have practical applicability and to be a suitable method for point-of-care testing because it does not require specific manipulation, additional education of staff or use of sophisticated analytical instruments. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases related to the decrease of neurotransmitter acetylcholine in neurons is based on compounds that prevent or disrupt the action of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. A series of thirteen quinuclidine carbamates were designed using quinuclidine as the structural base and a carbamate group to ensure the covalent binding to the cholinesterase, which were synthesized and tested as potential human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors. The synthesized compounds differed in the substituents on the amino and carbamoyl parts of the molecule. All of the prepared carbamates displayed a time-dependent inhibition with overall inhibition rate constants in the 103 M-1 min-1 range. None of the compounds showed pronounced selectivity for any of the cholinesterases. The in silico determined ability of compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) revealed that six compounds should be able to pass the BBB by passive transport. In addition, the compounds did not show toxicity toward cells that represented the main models of individual organs. By machine learning, the most optimal regression models for the prediction of bioactivity were established and validated. Models for AChE and BChE described 89 and 90% of the total variations among the data, respectively. These models facilitated the prediction and design of new and more potent inhibitors. Altogether, our study confirmed that quinuclidinium carbamates are promising candidates for further development as CNS-active drugs, particularly for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={This research work examined and likened effect of eugenol a natural phenolic compound with butylated hydroxylanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) synthetic phenolic compounds with key biomolecules [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and monoamine oxidase (MAO)] relevant to Alzheimer's diseases (AD) in vitro. Ten millimolar each sample was prepared in a mixture of ethanol and water (1:1 v/v), and the interactions with AChE, BChE, and MAO were evaluated. Still, ferric reducing antioxidant property, ABTS radicals scavenging ability and lipid peroxidation were carried out. The results revealed eugenol, BHT, and BHA inhibited AChE, BChE, and MAO activities dose-dependently. Though, eugenol had greater inhibitory effect against AChE and BChE activities. Also, eugenol demonstrated higher antioxidant potential compared to BHT and BHA. The potent enzymatic inhibitory and antioxidant effects of eugenol indicate eugenol could be promising as an alternative food additive and neuromodulator in AD management. Practical application: BHT and BHA are synthetic antioxidant employed industrially as food preservative. BHT and BHA are employed in food packaging, drugs, and cosmetics. Although BHT and BHA are widely in use but have been found were associated with alteration in sleeping, induced changes in brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels with increased cholinesterase activity. Endocrine disrupting effects, reproductive disorder is more side effects associated with the use of BHT and BHA. However, eugenol a natural compound found in plants compares favorably with BHT and BHA as antioxidant with many more health promoting benefits such as neuroprotective effects, antiapoptotic effects, and prevent aluminum toxicity. Eugenol being a natural antioxidant with no side effects showing more promising effects over the synthetic phenolic compounds and could be an alternative for the BHT and BHA. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={The genus Verbascum, commonly known as "mullein", bears several species traditionally used to treat various infections, inflammations and wounds. In this study, extracts from V. bombyciferum, an endemic Verbascum species from Turkey, obtained by different solvents and extraction techniques, were investigated for their bioactive contents using spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and evaluated for their antioxidant, as well as enzyme inhibitory potentials. While spectrophotometric determination revealed the homogenizer assisted extraction/methanolic extract to yield the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents (41.80 ± 0.70 mg GAE/g and 39.44 ± 0.30 mg RE/g, respectively), the most significant total bioactive compounds (polyphenols) in the amount of 272.862 mg kg−1, established by HPLC-MS/MS analysis, was noted for the maceration/methanolic extract. Overall, the extracts showed varied antioxidant potency, displaying free radical scavenging ability (DPPH assay: 1.04–51.33 mg TE/g; ABTS assay: 80.04–85.60 mg TE/g), reducing power (CUPRAC: 51.48–183.26 mg TE/g; FRAP: 36.33–90.04 mg TE/g; metal chelating activity (18.48–19.80 mg EDTAE/g) and total antioxidant capacity (phosphomolybdenum assay: 0.78–1.92 mmol TE/g). However, extract of homogenizer assisted extraction/methanol exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in most assays. Only the maceration/methanolic extract inhibited all the studied enzymes (acetylcholinetserase: 2.02 ± 0.20 mg GALAE/g; butyrylcholinesterase: 4.57 ± 0.09 mg GALAE/g; tyrosinase 21.44 ± 3.41 mg KAE/g and amylase: 0.46 ± 0.01 mmol ACAE/g).

abstract={In this study, Chlorococcum sp. was investigated for its cholinesterase inhibitory potentials and antioxidant activity. The algal sample was cultivated, harvested, and extracted sequentially using n-hexane, dichloromethane, and ethanol. The extracts were characterized using Fourier transmission infra-red (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The metal chelating, radical scavenging activities, as well as anticholinesterase potentials of the algal extract, was also investigated. FTIR characterization of the microalgal biomass revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and fatty acids. The extracts showed the presence of phytol, neophytadiene, butylated hydroxyl toluene, and 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. The ethanol extract showed the highest DPPH (IC50 = 147.40 µg/ml) and OH (IC50 = 493.90 µg/ml) radical scavenging and metal chelating (IC50 = 83.25 µg/ml) activities. Similarly, the ethanol extract (IC50 = 13.83 µg/ml) exhibited the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, while the dichloromethane extract showed the highest butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. All the extracts exhibited antioxidant properties and inhibitory effects against butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase; however, ethanol extracts showed better activity. Practical applications: Biomass obtained from some microalgal species is commonly used as dietary supplements and nutraceuticals due to the presence of high-valued products. However, the antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of biomass from Chlorococcum sp. have not been explored. Chlorococcum sp. extracts contain some antioxidants such as 3-tert-Butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, phytol, and neophytadiene. Characterization of the extracts also revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, and fatty acids. These compounds may contribute to the observed antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of Chlorococcum sp. The result of this study suggests that Chlorococcum sp. may contain some nutraceuticals which could be used as antioxidants and cholinesterase inhibitors. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

A positive correlation between the white blood cells counts, and the lipase, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, advanced oxidation protein products, and lactate levels in saliva were observed at the delivery. A linear association between selected salivary analytes at different sampling times and the milk yield after calving was observed.

abstract={Dietary phenolic compounds intake have been reported to have an inverse relationship to the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of caffeic acid (CFA) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) on rats fed with high cholesterol diet (HCD). Experimental animals were fed with high cholesterol diet (HCD) for a period of 21 days while simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg BWT), CFA and CGA (10 and 15 mg/kg BWT) were administered daily. Activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and arginase were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the rats fed with HCD alone. Also, level of malondiadehyde equivalent compounds (MDA) was significantly (P<0.05) elevated in hypercholesterolemic rats. Nevertheless, treatment with simvastatin, CFA and CGA normalized altered AChE, BChE and arginase activities as well as improved antioxidant status in hypercholesterolemic rats. CFA and CGA could offer protective role in hypercholeseterolemic rats via their antioxidant potentials as well as restoring altered activity of acetylcholinesterase, butrylcholinesterase and arginase.

In this study, we developed a novel series of monoquaternary reactivators combining permanently charged moieties tethered to position 6- of 3-hydroxypyridine-2-aldoxime reactivating subunit. Highlighted representatives (21, 24, and 27; also coded as K1371, K1374, and K1375, respectively) that contained 1-phenylisoquinolinium, 7-amino-1-phenylisoquinolinium and 4-carbamoylpyridinium moieties as peripheral anionic site ligands, respectively, showed efficacy superior or comparable to that of the clinically used standards. More importantly, these reactivators exhibited wide-spectrum efficacy and were minutely investigated via determination of their reactivation kinetics in parallel with molecular dynamics simulations to study their mechanisms of reactivation of the tabun-inhibited AChE conjugate. To further confirm the potential applicability of these candidates, a mouse in vivo assay was conducted. While K1375 had the lowest acute toxicity and the most suitable pharmacokinetic profile, the oxime K1374 with delayed elimination half-life was the most effective in ameliorating the signs of tabun toxicity. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo, the versatility of the agents was substantially superior to that of clinically used standards. Their high efficacy and broad-spectrum capability make K1374 and K1375 promising candidates that should be further investigated for their potential as nerve agents and insecticide antidotes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Five new examples of 9,10-chloro(bromo)-7-amine-spiro[chromeno[4,3-b]quinoline-6,1′-cycloalkanes] — in which cycloalkanes = cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane — were synthesized at yields of 42–56%, using a sequential one-pot two-step cyclocondensation reaction of three different scaffolds of 2-aminobenzonitriles and the respective spiro[chroman-2,1′-cycloalkan]-4-ones, and using AlCl3 as the catalyst in a solvent-free method. Subsequently, the five new spirochromeno-quinolines and nine quinolines previously published by us (14 modified tacrine scaffolds) were subjected to AChE and BChE inhibitory activity evaluation. The molecule containing a spirocyclopentane derivative had the highest AChE and BChE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 3.60 and 4.40 μM, respectively), and in general, the non-halogenated compounds were better inhibitors of AChE and BChE than the halogenated molecules. However, the inhibitory potency of compounds 3a-n was weaker than that of tacrine. By molecular docking simulations, it was found that the size of the spirocarbocyclic moieties is inversely proportional to the inhibitory activity of the cholinesterases, probably because an increase in the size of the spirocyclic component sterically hindered the interaction of tacrine derivatives with the active site of tested cholinesterases. The findings obtained here may help in the design and development of new anticholinesterase drugs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The complex pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has prompted researchers to develop multitarget-directed molecules to find an effective therapy against the disease. In this context, a novel series of N-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-5-arylisoxazole-3-carboxamide derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). In vitro biological evaluation demonstrated that compound 4e was the best AChE (IC50 = 16.07 μM) and BuChE inhibitor (IC50 = 15.16 μM). A kinetic study of 4e was also conducted, which presented a mixed-type inhibition for both enzymes. Molecular docking studies revealed that compound 4e fitted well into the active sites of AChE and BuChE, forming stable and strong interactions with key residues Glu199, Trp84, Asp72, Tyr121, and Phe288 in AChE and His438, Trp82, Ala328, Tyr332, Phe329, Thr120, and Pro285 in BuChE. Besides, the inhibition of BACE1 by 4e and the biometal chelation activity of 4e were measured. The neuroprotective assessment revealed that 4e exhibited 23.2% protection at 50 µM toward amyloid-beta-induced PC12 neuronal cells.

abstract={Medicinal plants have been used traditionally since ancient times as alternative medications to treat various human diseases. In this work, we examined the chemical constituent, antioxidant activity, and enzyme inhibition of an endemic plant Thymus migricus. The plant extracts showed remarkable inhibition effects against the acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and α-glycosidase (α-Gly) enzymes that are linked with some metabolic disorders. IC50 values (concentration of a sample to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity) for AChE, BChE, GST, and α-Gly were found as 18.23 mg/mL, 17.77 mg/mL, 31.5 mg/ml, and 16.5 mg/mL, respectively. Antioxidant activities of water extract of T. migricus (WET) and methanol extract of T. migricus (MET) were determined using four in vitro techniques. The extracts showed considerable antioxidant actions on all four techniques. In addition, quinic acid (18.30 mg/g), chlorogenic acid (0.94 mg/g), cynaroside (0.49 mg/g), luteolin (0.21 mg/g), and p-coumaric acid (0.19 mg/g) were characterized as major phenolic compounds using advanced LC–MS/MS technique. The interactions of some phenolic compounds with the enzymes have been investigated using molecular docking studies. The docking analysis results revealed that the interactions of the major compounds of the plant with AChE, BChE, GST, and α-Gly enzymes are responsible for the inhibitory activity. © 2020, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={The chemical and pharmacological profiles of essential oils (EOs) hydrodistilled in yields of 0.03–0.77 % (w/w) from three exotic (Cinnamomum camphora, Petroselinum crispum, and Syzygium samarangense) and two endemic (Pittosporum senacia subsp. senacia and Syzygium coriaceum) medicinal plants were studied. GC-MS/GC-FID analysis of the EOs identified the most dominant components to be myristicin (40.3 %), myrcene (62.2 %), 1,8-cineole (54.0 %), β-pinene (21.3 %) and (E)-β-ocimene (24.4 %) in P. crispum, P. senacia and C. camphora, S. samarangense and S. coriaceum EOs, respectively. All EOs were found to possess anti-amylase (0.70–1.50 mM ACAE/g EO) and anti-tyrosinase (109.35–158.23 mg KAE/g) properties, whereas no glucosidase inhibition was displayed. Only Syzygium EOs acted as dual inhibitors of both acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterases, while P. senacia and C. camphora EOs inhibited acetylcholinesterase selectively and P. crispum EO was inactive (AChE: 4.64–4.96 mg GALAE/g; BChE: 5.96 and 7.10 mg GALAE/g). Molecular docking revealed 1,8-cineole to present the best binding affinities with butyrylcholinesterase, amylase and tyrosinase, while both myristicin and β-pinene with acetylcholinesterase and finally β-pinene with glucosidase. In vitro antioxidant potency was also demonstrated in different assays (DPPH: 13.52–53.91 mg TE/g, ABTS: 5.49–75.62 mg TE/g; CUPRAC: 45.38–243.21 mg TE/g, FRAP: 42.49–110.64 mg TE/g; and phosphomolybdenum assay: 82.61–160.93 mM TE/g). Principal component analysis revealed the EOs to differ greatly in their bioactivities due to their chemodiversity. This study has unveiled some interesting preliminary pharmacological profiles of the EOs that could be explored for their potential applications as phytotherapeutics. © 2021 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland},

abstract={Essential oils (EO) represent an important source of bioactive molecules and are widely used for their great efficacy relating to their different therapeutic properties. The present study aims to contribute to the valorization of Daucus virgatus (Poir.) Maire, an aromatic and native plant spontaneously growing in the North-Eastern regions of Algeria, by analyzing the chemical composition of its essential oil and evaluating the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, together with the assay of the enzyme inhibitory effects against a-glucosidase and cholinesterase. Daucus virgatus EO was extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscometry analysis (GC-MS). Twenty-one constituents accounting for 98% of the whole components were identified. (β-Pinene (77.9%) and a-pinene (7.6%) were the most abundant components. The antimicrobial activity against the pathogen microorganisms Listeria innocua, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans was investigated. The best antimicrobial effect was observed against S. typhimurium and C. albicans, which showed high sensitivity, with inhibition zones ranging between 27.3 and 25 mm; the minimum inhibitory concentrations were 15.63 and 31.25 µg ml-1, respectively. In the DPPH test, the essential oil showed a moderate antioxidant effect, with an IC50 value of 39.61 mg ml-1. D. virgatus EO exhibited an interesting inhibitory effect against a-glucosidase enzyme (IC50 = 0.35 mg ml-1) compared with the positive control Acarbose (IC50 = 0.24 mg ml-1), and a moderate inhibitory effect against cholinesterases enzymes, with IC50 values of 0.33 and 0.20 mg ml-1 for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively. D. virgatus EO might be used as a promising source of natural products with potential antimicrobial, antihyperglycemic and anti-Alzheimer effects. © 2021, Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry Research.

abstract={Fish cholinesterases (ChEs) – like acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) – are common biomarkers of environmental contamination due to their sensitivity to a variety of toxicants. To understand pesticide effects on fish ChEs mean activity and variability, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses. Our goal was to verify (i) if brain and muscle ChEs responded differently to pesticide exposure; (ii) how fish size and life stage (i.e., juvenile and adult) influence ChEs variability and mean activity; (iii) what type of pesticides (i.e., herbicide, insecticide, and fungicide) has the strongest effect, and if the analytical-grade compounds differ from commercial formulations; (iv) if increasing concentrations combined with prolonged exposure leads to stronger ChEs inhibition; and (v) how each class of pesticide affects these enzymes. We validated ChEs reliability as biomarkers and identified factors influencing their response. Regardless of tissue, BChE response was more variable than AChE, and no difference between their average activity was detected. The size of juvenile fish is an important factor affecting ChEs mean activity and variability, whereas pesticide had no significant effect on adult fish ChEs. Insecticides were stronger inhibitors compared to herbicides and fungicides. Analytical-grade compounds decreased ChEs mean activity to a higher degree than commercial formulations. The combined effect of concentration and time was only significant for fungicides and insecticides. Among classes, organophosphorus insecticides had the strongest effect on ChEs, followed by carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids. Organophosphorus herbicides and oxazolidinones were the only herbicides to decrease ChEs mean activity significantly, and their effects were similar from those of pyrethroids and organochlorines. Additionally, our results identified research gaps, such as the small number of studies on fungicides, neonicotinoids and other relevant pesticides. These findings suggest future directions, which might help researchers identify robust cause-effect relationships between fish ChEs and pesticides. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning (AOPP) is a worldwide health concern that has threatened human lives for decades, which attacks acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and causes nervous system disorders. Classical treatment options are associated with shortin vivohalf-life and side effects. As a potential alternative, delivery of mammalian-derived butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) offers a cost-effective way to block organophosphorus attack on acetylcholinesterase, a key enzyme in the neurotransmitter cycle. Yet the use of exotic BChE as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent is compromised by short plasma residence, immune response and unfavorable biodistribution. To overcome these obstacles, BChE nanodepots (nBChE) composed of a BChE core/polymorpholine shell structure were preparedvia in situpolymerization, which showed enhanced stability, prolonged plasma circulation, attenuated antigenicity and reduced accumulation in non-targeted tissues.In vivoadministration of nBChE pre- or post-organophosphorus exposure in a BALB/C mouse model resulted in potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic delivery of non-human BChE to tackle AOPP. In addition, this work also opens up a new avenue for real applications in both research and clinical settings to cope with acute intoxication-related diseases. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.},

The neuroprotective and anti-ageing potentials of essential oils (EOs) are widely evaluated around the globe. The objective of this review is to analyse the effectiveness of EOs as neuroprotective remedies among the four common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The literature was extracted from three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar) between the years of 2010 to 2020 using the medical subject heading (MeSH) terms "essential oil", crossed with "Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "Huntington's disease (HD)", "Parkinson's disease (PD)" or "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)". Eighty three percent (83%) of the studies were focused on AD, while another 12% focused on PD. No classifiable study was recorded on HD or ALS. EO from Salvia officinalis has been recorded as one of the most effective acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, only Cinnamomum sp. has been assessed for its effectiveness in both AD and PD. Our review provided useful evidence on EOs as potential neuroprotective remedies for age-related neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract={A novel series of arylcarbamate-N-acylhydrazones derivatives have been designed and synthesized as potential anti-cholinesterase agents. In vitro studies revealed that these compounds demonstrated selective for butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) with potent inhibitory activity. The compounds 10a-d, 12b and 12d were the most potent BuChE inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.07–2.07 µM, highlighting the compound 10c (IC50 = 0.07 µM) which showed inhibitory activity 50 times greater than the reference drug donepezil (IC50 = 3.54 µM). The activity data indicates that the position of the carbamate group in the aromatic ring has a greater influence on the inhibitory activity of the derivatives. The enzyme kinetics studies indicate that the compound 10c has a non-competitive inhibition against BuChE with Ki value of 0.097 mM. Molecular modeling studies corroborated the in vitro inhibitory mode of interaction and show that compound 10c is stabilized into hBuChE by strong hydrogen bond interaction with Tyr128, π-π stacking interaction with Trp82 and CH⋯O interactions with His438, Gly121 and Glu197. Based on these data, compound 10c was identified as low-cost promising candidate for a drug prototype for AD treatment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

It acted as a hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibitor of human erythrocyte AChE with Ki = 0.69 ± 0.13; α = 1; β = 0.08 ± 0.02. On the other hand, the inhibitory effects of SO on two BChE mutants, where A328 was modified to either F or Y, revealed differences in terms of inhibitory patterns and Ki values, compared to the obtained results with recombinant wild type BChE. SO was found to act as a linear competitive inhibitor of A328F and A328Y BChE mutants. Compared to recombinant wild type BChE, A328Y and A328F BChE mutants caused a 4- and 10-fold decrease in Ki value for SO, respectively. These findings were supported by molecular modelling studies. In conclusion, SO is a potent inhibitor of human cholinesterases and may be useful in the design and development of new drugs for the treatment of AD. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Preliminary chemical optimization was performed to develop more potent and selective sertaconazole analogues. In consideration of the selectivity and the inhibitory activity against target proteins, compounds 5c and 5d were selected for the next study. Further modification of compound 5c led to the generation of compound 10g with notably improved selectivity towards BuChE versus AChE.

abstract={Based on the broad spectrum of biological activity of hydrazide-hydrazones, trifluoromethyl compounds, and clinical usage of cholinesterase inhibitors, we investigated hydrazones obtained from 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzohydrazide and various benzaldehydes or aliphatic ketones as potential inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). They were evaluated using Ellman's spectrophotometric method. The hydrazide-hydrazones produced a dual inhibition of both cholinesterase enzymes with IC50 values of 46.8-137.7 µM and 19.1-881.1 µM for AChE and BuChE, respectively. The majority of the compounds were stronger inhibitors of AChE; four of them (2-bromobenzaldehyde, 3-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde, cyclohexanone, and camphor-based 2o, 2p, 3c, and 3d, respectively) produced a balanced inhibition of the enzymes and only 2-chloro/trifluoromethyl benzylidene derivatives 2d and 2q were found to be more potent inhibitors of BuChE. 4-(Trifluoromethyl)-N'-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzylidene]benzohydrazide 2l produced the strongest inhibition of AChE via mixed-type inhibition determined experimentally. Structure-activity relationships were identified. The compounds fit physicochemical space for targeting central nervous systems with no apparent cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cell line together.

abstract={Herein, the synthesis, design, and the physicochemical characterization of phosphorus functionalized thiazolotriazole (PFT) compound are presented. The PFT tests on the biological activity revealed butyrylcholinesterase inhibition that was confirmed and explained with molecular docking studies. The pronounced reduction of optical density and biological activity was found as a result of irradiation of the PFT water solution with laser beam at wavelength 266 nm. The observed phenomenon was explained on the base of molecular dynamics, docking, and density functional theory modeling by the formation of PFT conformers via laser-induced phosphonate group twisting. The reorganization of the PFT geometry was found to be a reason of butyrylcholinesterase inhibition mechanism change and the site-specificity loss. These results demonstrate that PFT combines photoswitching and bioactive properties in one molecule that makes it promising as a molecular basis for the further design of bioactive substances with photosensitive properties based on the mechanism of the phosphonate group phototwisting. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in elderly individuals, is marked by progressive neuron loss. Despite more than 100 years of research on AD, there is still no treatment to cure or prevent the disease. High levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain are neuropathological hallmarks of AD. However, based on postmortem analyses, up to 44% of individuals have been shown to have high Aβ deposits with no clinical signs, due to having a “cognitive reserve”. The biochemical mechanism explaining the prevention of cognitive impairment in the presence of Aβ plaques is still unknown. It seems that in addition to protein aggregation, neuroinflammatory changes associated with aging are present in AD brains that are correlated with a higher level of brain iron and oxidative stress. It has been shown that iron accumulates around amyloid plaques in AD mouse models and postmortem brain tissues of AD patients. Iron is required for essential brain functions, including oxidative metabolism, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. However, an imbalance in brain iron homeostasis caused by aging underlies many neurodegenerative diseases. It has been proposed that high iron levels trigger an avalanche of events that push the progress of the disease, accelerating cognitive decline. Patients with increased amyloid plaques and iron are highly likely to develop dementia. Our observations indicate that the butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) level seems to be iron-dependent, and reports show that BChE produced by reactive astrocytes can make cognitive functions worse by accelerating the decay of acetylcholine in aging brains. Why, even when there is a genetic risk, do symptoms of the disease appear after many years? Here, we discuss the relationship between genetic factors, age-dependent iron tissue accumulation, and inflammation, focusing on AD. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Semi‐synthetic triterpenoids, holding an amino substituted seven‐membered A‐ring (azepano‐ring), which could be synthesized from triterpenic oximes through a Beckmann type re-arrangement followed by a reduction of lactame fragment, are considered to be novel promising agents exhibiting anti‐microbial, alpha‐glucosidase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. In this study, in an attempt to develop new antitumor candidates, a series of A‐ring azepano‐ and 3‐amino‐3,4‐seco‐derivatives of betulin, oleanolic, ursolic, and glycyrrhetinic acids were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against five human cancer cell lines and non‐malignant mouse fibro-blasts by means of a colorimetric sulforhodamine assay. Azepanoallobetulinic acid amide deriva-tive 11 was the most cytotoxic compound of this series but showed little selectivity between the different human tumor cell lines. Flow cytometry experiments showed compound 11 to act mainly by apoptosis (44.3%) and late apoptosis (21.4%). The compounds were further screened at the National Cancer Institute towards a panel of 60 cancer cell lines. It was found that compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 20 showed growth inhibitory (GI50) against the most sensitive cell lines at submicromolar concentrations (0.20–0.94 μM), and their cytotoxic activity (LC50) was also high (1–6 μM). Derivatives 3, 8, 11, 15, and 16 demonstrated a certain selectivity profile at GI50 level from 5.16 to 9.56 towards K‐562, CCRF‐CEM, HL‐60(TB), and RPMI‐8226 (Leukemia), HT29 (Colon cancer), and OVCAR‐4 (Ovarian cancer) cell lines. Selectivity indexes of azepanoerythrodiol 3 at TGI level ranged from 5.93 (CNS cancer cell lines SF‐539, SNB‐19 and SNB‐75) to 14.89 for HCT‐116 (colon cancer) with SI 9.56 at GI50 level for the leukemia cell line K‐562. The present study highlighted the importance of A‐azepano‐ring in the triterpenic core for the development of novel antitumor agents, and a future aim to increase the selectivity profile will thus lie in the area of modifications of azepano‐triterpenic acids at their carboxyl group. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Poisoning with organophosphorus compounds used as pesticides or misused as chemical weapons remains a serious threat to human health and life. Their toxic effects result from irreversible blockade of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, which causes overstimulation of the cholinergic system and often leads to serious injury or death. Treatment of organophosphorus poisoning involves, among other strategies, the administration of oxime compounds. Oximes reactivate cholinesterases by breaking the covalent bond between the serine residue from the enzyme active site and the phosphorus atom of the organophosphorus compound. Although the general mechanism of reactivation has been known for years, the exact molecular aspects determining the efficiency and selectivity of individual oximes are still not clear. This hinders the development of new active compounds. In our research, using relatively simple and widely available molecular docking methods, we investigated the reactivation of acetyl-and butyrylcholinesterase blocked by sarin and tabun. For the selected oximes, their binding modes at each step of the reactivation process were identified. Amino acids essential for effective reactivation and those responsible for the selectivity of individual oximes against inhibited acetyl-and butyrylcholinesterase were identified. This research broadens the knowledge about cholinesterase reactivation and demonstrates the usefulness of molecular docking in the study of this process. The presented observations and methods can be used in the future to support the search for new effective reactivators. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Introduction: Variants of butyrylcholinesterase are frequently associated with prolonged response to suxamethonium or mivacurium. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) can be characterized by phenotyping and determination of genotype. Inappropriate timing of blood sampling might interfere with phenotyping methods. However, guidelines regarding delay between exposure to anaesthesia and testing are not clearly defined. In this study, the BChE activity and phenotype in an early (T1) and late (T2) phase were compared and the phenotype/genotype correlation was assessed. Methods: Patients with a prolonged paralysis after mivacurium or suxamethonium were selected after ethical committee approval and written consent. BChE activity was based on butyrylthiocholine hydrolysis rate and phenotyping on differential inhibition of BChE activity with dibucaine and fluoride. DNA sequencing allowed genotypic characterization. Results: We included the results of 20 patients with prolonged neuromuscular block (NMB) induced by mivacurium or suxamethonium. In these patients, BChE activity was different at T1 and T2 (2120 [1506-2733] U L−1 and 4055 [2810-5301] U L−1, respectively; P = 0.0014; values are mean [95% CI]). When phenotyping was possible, phenotyping at T1 and T2 yielded identical results. Phenotyping failed to identify one new variant (p.Tyr146Cys) and the K variant in 14 of 16 patients. Conclusion: Anaesthesia interfered with BChE activity, but not with phenotyping. Phenotyping can be performed on blood drawn during or immediately after recovery of mivacurium or suxamethonium to screen for clinically relevant variants of BChE. However, accurate diagnosis of BChE deficiency needs further confirmation by determination of genotype. © 2020 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: Molecular imaging agents targeting butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) have shown promise in other neurodegenerative disorders and may have utility in detecting changes to normal appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis (MS). BChE activity is present in white matter and localizes to activated microglia associated with MS lesions. The purpose of this study was to further characterize changes in the cholinergic system in MS pathology, and to explore the utility of BChE radioligands as potential diagnostic and treatment monitoring agents in MS. Procedure: Cortical and white matter lesions were identified using myelin staining, and lesions were classified based on microglial activation patterns. Adjacent brain sections were used for cholinesterase histochemistry and in vitro autoradiography using phenyl 4-[123I]-iodophenylcarbamate (123I-PIP), a previously described small-molecule cholinesterase-binding radioligand. Results: BChE activity is positively correlated with microglial activation in white matter MS lesions. There is no alteration in cholinesterase activity in cortical MS lesions. 123I-PIP autoradiography revealed uptake of radioactivity in normal white matter, absence of radioactivity within demyelinated MS lesions, and variable uptake of radioactivity in adjacent normal-appearing white matter. Conclusions: BChE imaging agents have the potential to detect MS lesions and subtle pathology in normal-appearing white matter in postmortem MS brain tissue. The possibility of BChE imaging agents serving to supplement current diagnostic and treatment monitoring strategies should be evaluated. © 2020, World Molecular Imaging Society.},

abstract={Two new unsaturated fatty acid esters (1 and 2) and five new unsaturated fatty acids (4–8), together with two known analogs (3 and 9) were isolated from the aerial parts of Lycopodiastrum casuarinoides. Their structures were unambiguously elucidated by obtaining extensive spectroscopic data and comparing them with data in the literature. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were established by a modified Mosher's method. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Compound 8 exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against AChE with an IC50 value of 1.16 ± 0.13 μM. © 2020 Phytochemical Society of Europe},

abstract={Two cholinesterases have been found in vertebrates, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). These enzymes are present in the gilthead seabream, AChE in the brain and muscle and BChE in the muscle. Cholinesterases have been used as biomarker of effect in environmental monitoring studies. However, there are few studies about the influence of biometric parameters on ChE. This paper studies the possible influence of biological factors on brain and muscle cholinesterase (ChE) in Sparus aurata. Our results show that ChE activity in brain and muscle tissues changes depending on several biological variables. ChE activity in these tissues decreased when the age (48–152 week), body length (14.15–28.95 cm) and body weight (42.73–380.74 g) of the fishes studied increased. The relationships between brain and muscle ChE activity and several biometric factors were curvilinear. On the other hand, in vivo sensitivity of cholinesterase in the gilthead seabream exposed to organophosphorus pesticides (azinphosmethyl, dimethoate and dichlorvos) was studied in order to learn about recovery from cholinesterase present (brain and muscle) after exposure to a sublethal dose. The recovery of muscle AChE was similar to cerebral AChE, while muscular BChE showed a slower recovery. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Aplysinopsins are a group of marine-derived indole alkaloids that display diverse array of pharmacological effects. However, their effect on anti-Alzheimer targets has not been reported. Herein, we report the synthesis of aplysinopsin (1) and its effect on cholinesterases and beta-site amyloid-precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1). It inhibits electric eel acetylcholinesterase (AChE), equine serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and human BACE-1 with IC50 values of 33.9, 30.3, and 33.7 µM, respectively, and excellent BBB permeability (Pe 8.92 × 10−6 cm/s). To optimize its sub-micromolar activity, the first-generation analogs were prepared and screened. Two most active analogs 5b and (Z)-8g were found to effectively permeate the BBB (Pe &gt; 5 × 10−6 cm/s). The N-sulphonamide derivative 5b display better cholinesterase inhibition, whereas the other analog (Z)-8g strongly inhibits BACE-1 (IC50 0.78 µM) activity. The analog 5b interacts primarily with PAS of AChE, and thus exhibit a mixed-type of inhibition. In addition, aplysinopsin along with new analogs inhibited the self-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation. The data presented herein indicate that the aplysinopsin-scaffold holds a potential for further investigation as a multi-targeted anti-Alzheimer agent. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Geophytes are gaining interest as sources of natural ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical area. In this sense, six bulbous plant species from Turkey are investigated, namely Hyacinthella campanulata K.Perss. & Wendelbo, Muscari neglectum Guss. ex Ten., Tulipa humilis herb., Iris stenophylla Hausskn. ex Baker, Galanthus elwesii Hook. f. and Crocus danfordiae Maw. with the aim to highlight their chemical compositions and biological properties. Polyphenolic profiles of the different plant parts (flower, bulb and leaf) of the six genotypes were evaluated using colorimetric methods as well LC–MS/MS. The antioxidant properties and enzymes inhibitory potential (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, tyrosinase and cholinesterases) of the extracts were determined. Overall, highest total phenolic content and total flavonoid content were observed in the leaf extracts of the studied species, except for M. neglectum (flower extract) and T. humilis (flower extract). LC–MS/MS analysis revealed the abundance of some phenolic compounds including quinic acid, hesperidin and chlorogenic acid in selective extracts. The extracts showed significant antioxidant potentials, with leaf extract of the I. stenophylla being more potent, which is linked to its high phenolic contents. All the extracts displayed notable anti-acetylcholinesterase (1.77 – 2.53 mg GALAE/g) and tyrosinase (54.9–67.20 mg KAE/g). Selective extracts have showed activity against butyrylcholinesterase, with bulb extract of M. neglectum (2.99 mg GALAE/g), I. stenophylla (2.53 mg GALAE/g) and G. elwesii (2.52 mg GALAE/g) showing highest activity. Modest activity was observed against α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The experimental data gathered herein is the first report on the phytochemical and biological attributes of these bulbous plant species which project them as potential sources of biologically active compounds for phytomedicines and nutraceuticals development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Dementia is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in older adults, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common cause. AD has a significant impact on economic and psychosocial status. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are currently the mainstay in the management of AD. Rivastigmine is the only ChEI that inhibits both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes in the brain. This dual inhibition makes it potentially more effective for AD patients. Its availability as both a transdermal formulation and oral capsule, may improve adherence rates and care giver satisfaction compared with other ChEIs. To date, the data from randomized clinical trials and post marketing observational studies have shown evidence for an impact on cognitive functions in AD with good safety and tolerability. © 2021},

abstract={Despite the improvements in life expectancy, neurodegenerative conditions have arguably become the most dreaded maladies of older people. The neuroprotective and anti-ageing potentials of essential oils (EOs) are widely evaluated around the globe. The objective of this review is to analyse the effectiveness of EOs as neuroprotective remedies among the four common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The literature was extracted from three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar) between the years of 2010 to 2020 using the medical subject heading (MeSH) terms “essential oil”, crossed with “Alzheimer’s disease (AD)”, “Huntington’s disease (HD)”, “Parkinson’s disease (PD)” or “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)”. Eighty three percent (83%) of the studies were focused on AD, while another 12% focused on PD. No classifiable study was recorded on HD or ALS. EO from Salvia officinalis has been recorded as one of the most effective acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, only Cinnamomum sp. has been assessed for its effectiveness in both AD and PD. Our review provided useful evidence on EOs as potential neuroprotective remedies for age-related neurodegenerative diseases. © 2021 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

The absolute configuration of narcieliine (3) has also been determined. Compounds isolated in a sufficient quantity were evaluated for their in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE; E.C. 3.1.1.7), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; E.C. 3.1.1.8), and prolyl oligopeptidase (POP; E.C. 3.4.21.26) inhibition activities. Significant human AChE/BuChE (hAChE/hBuChE) inhibitory activity was demonstrated by the newly described alkaloid narcieliine (3), with IC50 values of 18.7 ± 2.3 µM and 1.34 ± 0.31 µM, respectively. This compound is also predicted to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) through passive diffusion.

N-Butyl- and N-chlorophenyl-5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzene-1,3-diols were identified as the most promising compounds of low nanomolar activity against AChE (IC50 = 29–76 nM) and moderate activity against BuChE. The inhibition mechanism studies proved that the compounds are mixed type inhibitors. The docking simulations showed great affinity of the compounds for both enzymes. The modelled amine derivatives exhibited a similar arrangement in the catalytic anionic site of AChE similar to that of tacrine. The thiadiazole ring interacted with Trp84 and the phenyl groups created π-π stacking interactions with the residue – Phe330. The compounds showed better inhibition of the in vitro self-induced Aβ (1–42) aggregation than that compared with curcumin as well as antioxidant properties similar to those of quercetin.

We obtained blood samples and the residual condition index of toads from rural and industrial zones from Coatzacoalcos River, Mexico (COA). In the blood samples, we determined the activity of enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and the presence of cell death (apoptosis). We found that the activity of the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase was lower. Still, the glutathione s-transferase activity and the percentage of apoptosis in erythrocytes were higher in the toads of COA than laboratory toads. Meanwhile, some biomarkers in toads showed differences when compared between Industrial and Rural zones. These results and correlations between biomarkers showed how the response changed in the toads living near the industrial zones.

abstract={Neurotransmitter depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the multiple pathological events that lead to neurodegeneration. Following our previous studies related with the development of multitarget mitochondriotropic antioxidants, this study aims to evaluate whether the π‐system extension on the chemical scaffolds of AntiOXCIN2 and AntiOXCIN3 affects their bioactivity and safety profiles. After the synthesis of four triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) conjugates (compounds 2–5), we evaluated their antioxidant properties and their effect on neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzymes. All compounds were potent equine butyrylcholinesterase (eqBChE) and moderate electric eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE) inhibitors, with catechols 4 and 5 presenting lower IC50 values than AntiOXCIN2 and AntiOXCIN3, respectively. However, differences in the inhibition potency and selectivity of compounds 2–5 towards non‐human and human cholinester-ases (ChEs) were observed. Co‐crystallization studies with compounds 2–5 in complex with human ChEs (hChEs) showed that these compounds exhibit different binging modes to hAChE and hBChE. Unlike AntiOXCINs, compounds 2–5 displayed moderate human monoamine oxidase (hMAO) in-hibitory activity. Moreover, compounds 4 and 5 presented higher ORAC‐FL indexes and lower oxidation potential values than the corresponding AntiOXCINs. Catechols 4 and 5 exhibited broader safety windows in differentiated neuroblastoma cells than benzodioxole derivatives 2 and 3. Compound 4 is highlighted as a safe mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant with dual ChE/MAO inhibitory activity. Overall, this work is a contribution for the development of dual therapeutic agents addressing both mitochondrial oxidative stress and neurotransmitter depletion. © 2021 by the authors.

Ziziphus oxyphylla (a member of Rhamnaceae family) is a medicinal plant used as a remedy of different diseases in Greek and Ayurveda medical systems. Z. oxyphylla roots were shade dried and then subjected to extraction of bioactive compounds using different solvent systems and silica gel. From ethyl acetate fraction, three compounds viz., p-coumaric acid (V), 3,4-dimethoxy benzoic acid (VI), and 4-heptyloxy benzoic acid (VII) were isolated in pure form. The selection of ethyl acetate fraction for isolation was based on HPLC profiling of crude extract and different fractions. These compounds were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant, anticholinesterase, α–glucosidase, and α-amylase inhibitory potentials. To find out possible binding interactions of V with AChE and BChE crystals, in-silico docking studies were also carried out. Compound V showed maximum scavenging capabilities of DPPH and ABTS free radicals with IC50 values of 69 and 62 μg/mL respectively. Excellent percent inhibition (83.4 ± 0.5% at highest concentration 1000 μg/mL) of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was exhibited by compound V (IC50 = 80 μg/mL); whereas, for the mentioned concentration, 83.2 ± 1.1% inhibition (IC50 = 90 μg/mL) of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was observed as well. The compound VI exhibited highest % inhibition against α-glucosidase (IC50 = 84 μg/mL) whereas α-amylase was more potently inhibited by compound V (% inhibition = 86.8 % and IC50 = 85 μg/mL). Docking scores of -1.391 Kcal/mol (BChE) and –6.253 Kcal/mol (AChE) were recorded using molecular docking software. Compound V exhibited strong free radical scavenging and anticholinesterase potentials suggesting that it can be effectively used to treat oxidative stress and dementia in human. © 2021 The Author(s)

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by central cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, and intellectual decline poses a major public health problem affecting millions of people around the globe. Despite several clinically approved drugs and development of anti-Alzheimer's heterocyclic structural leads, the treatment of AD requires safer hybrid therapeutics with characteristic structural and biochemical properties. In this endeavor, we herein report a microwave-assisted synthesis of a library of quinoline thiosemicarbazones endowed with a piperidine moiety, achieved via the condensation of 6/8-methyl-2-(piperidin-1-yl)quinoline-3-carbaldehydes and (un)substituted thiosemicarbazides. The target N-heterocyclic products were isolated in excellent yields. The structures of all the synthesized compounds were fully established using readily available spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, 1H- and 13C-NMR). Anti-Alzheimer potential of the synthesized heterocyclic compounds was evaluated using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes. The in vitro biochemical assay results revealed several compounds as potent inhibitors of both enzymes. Among them, five compounds exhibited IC50 values less than 20 μM. N-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-((8-methyl-2-(piperidin-1-yl)quinolin-3-yl)methylene)hydrazine carbothioamide emerged as the most potent dual inhibitor of AChE and BChE with IC50 values of 9.68 and 11.59 μM, respectively. Various informative structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses were also concluded indicating the critical role of substitution pattern on the inhibitory efficacy of the tested derivatives. In vitro results were further validated through molecular docking analysis where interactive behavior of the potent inhibitors within the active pocket of enzymes was established. Quinoline thiosemicarbazones were also tested for their cytotoxicity using MTT assay against HepG2 cells. Among the 26 novel compounds, there were five cytotoxical and 18 showed proliferative properties.},

abstract={Polygonum hydropiper L. and related species are reported to possess neuroprotective potentials. In an attempt to validate its anti-Alzheimer’s potentials, leaf oils (Ph. Lo) were extensively evaluated in this study against several in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer’s disease. The Ph. Lo were tested against pathological targets of Alzheimer’s diseases (ADs). The in vitro and in vivo assays were done for cholinesterase inhibition, anti-radical properties and cognitive assessments using transgenic animal models. In preliminary cholinesterase inhibition assays, Ph. Lo were more active against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) radicals. Subsequently, Ph. Lo was evaluated for its effects on special memory, exploratory behavior, and coordination using shallow water maze (SWM), Y-maze, open filed, and balance beam tests. Animal pre-genotyping was done via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgene, and after completion of drug therapy, brain homogenates from the cortex and hippocampus were evaluated for cholinesterase and free radical studies. In SWM task, disease control animals treated with 10 mg/kg of Ph. Lo for 5 days exhibited significant improvement in cognitive performance indicated by low escape times on 5th day compared with normal animals. In the Y-maze test, transgenic animals showed higher spontaneous alternation behavior than disease control animals and standard control group animals. Ph. Lo therapy has improved the exploratory behavior and declined anxiety behavior in diseased animals as accessed via open field test. Ph. Lo administration significantly augmented the motor and coordination abilities of transgenic animals when compared to other groups of animals and declined AChE, BChE activities as well as free radicals load in the cortex and hippocampus tissues. Based on our finding, it is concluded that Ph. Lo exhibit significant neuroprotective potentials preliminary due to their anti-radicals and cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Ph. Lo need further detailed studies as potential aromatherapy against neurodegenerative disorders. © Copyright © 2021 Tong, Li, Ayaz, Ullah, Sadiq, Ovais, Shahid, Khayrullin and Hazrat.},

abstract={The interest in the therapeutic values of natural compounds from plants is growing worldwide because the development of modern synthetic drugs has not lived up to expectations. The tree Ficus religiosa native to India, China and Southeast Asia is traditionally used for curing almost 50 ailments, although the majority of the individual active compounds are not known. Hence, a hyphenated high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was newly developed. It allowed a physicochemical, but especially effect-directed profiling of individual compounds present in Ficus religiosa leaves obtained from four locations (in India and Germany). Extracts of different polarities were screened for bioactivity responses and most bioactivities were found in the ethyl acetate extracts. A multi-imaging via 26 different detection modes was performed, i. e. UV/Vis/FLD, 11 microchemical derivatizations and 12 effect-directed assays (EDA). By HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD-EDA, antibiotics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, α-amylase, α-glucosidase and β-glucosidase inhibitors and radical scavenging compounds were detected. Estrogen-like or gentotoxic compounds were not detected at higher extract amounts of even 5 mg/band applied. For further characterization of three most important, multipotent, bioactive compound zones, HPTLC was hyphenated with heated electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry including fragmentation (HPTLC-HESI-HRMS/MS). Multipotent bioactive compounds discovered in the extracts were equivalently calculated in reference to well-known reference inhibitors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Plant-based remedies have been widely used for the management of variable diseases due to their safety and less side effects. In the present study, we investigated Saussurea lappa CB. Clarke. (SL) given its largely reported medicinal effects. Specifically, our objective was to provide an insight into a new polymethyl methacrylate based nanocapsules as carriers of SL essential oil and characterize their biologic functions. The nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation technique, characterized and analyzed for their cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory, anti-Alzheimer and antidiabetic effects. The results revealed that the developed nanoparticles had a diameter around 145 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.18 and a zeta potential equal to +45 mV and they did not show any cytotoxicity at 25 μg·mL−1. The results also showed an anti-inflammatory activity (reduction in metalloprotease MMP-9 enzyme activity and RNA expression of inflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, GM-CSF and IL1β), a high anti-Alzheimer's effect (IC50 around 25.0 and 14.9 μg·mL−1 against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively), and a strong antidiabetic effect (IC50 were equal to 22.9 and 75.8 μg·mL−1 against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, respectively).

abstract={Beside acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase could be considered as a putative target of interest for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result of complexity of AD, no molecule has been approved since 2002.

Pleiotropic molecules, known as multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are currently developed to tackle the multifactorial origin of AD. In this context, we have developed a pleiotropic carbamate 7, that behaves as a covalent inhibitor of BuChE (IC50 = 0.97 μM). The latter will deliver after hydrolysis, compound 6, a potent 5-HT6 receptors antagonist (Ki = 11.4 nM) related to idalopirdine.

abstract={Acute intoxication incidents due to neurotoxic organophosphate (OP) insecticides are occasionally reported, related either to suicidal attempts or occupational exposure due to the misuse of protective equipment. Among them, chlorpyrifos is a compound related to great controversy, which is still authorized and easily accessible in many countries around the world. However, to screen for its exposure markers, instrumental methods are commonly applied, which cannot enable rapid monitoring at an early stage of an intoxication. Therefore, in this study, a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) able to rapidly screen for chlorpyrifos-oxon, the toxic chlorpyrifos metabolite, in human serum was developed and fully validated. The μPAD combines wax-printed butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) paper sensors, a lab-on-a-chip (LOC) prototype injector and a smartphone as the analytical detector. In principle, the wax-printed strips with adsorbed BChE are embedded into LOC injectors able to deliver samples and reagents on-demand. A smartphone reader was used to monitor the color development on the strips providing binary qualitative results. μPAD method performance characteristics were thoroughly evaluated in terms of specificity, detection capability (CCβ) and ruggedness. The developed analytical platform is rapid (results within 10 min), cost-efficient (0.70 €), potentially applicable at the point-of-need and attained a low CCβ (10 μg L−1 in human serum). Finally, μPAD characteristics were critically compared to well-established methods, namely an in-house BChE microplate assay and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Chlorothalonil (CLT) is a broad spectrum, and non-systemic fungicide applied in foliar structures to prevent and treat pathogens. This compound reaches to aquatic environments and affects the biota. In this context, the main goal of this study was to assess the effects of CLT at biochemical, tissular, and individual levels of biological organization using the invasive bivalve Corbicula largillierti as a bioindicator species. Clams were exposed to different sublethal concentrations (0, 10, 20 and 50 µg. L−1 CLT) for 96 h. At biochemical level, the enzymatic activity (Glutathione-s-Transferase, Catalase, Acetyl-, Butiryl- and Carboxyl-esterases) and lipid peroxidation were measured in gills and the visceral mass. Also, the digestive gland morphometry through quantitative histological indexes was registered at the tissular level. Finally, filtering activity and burial behavior at the individual level were measured. At the highest CLT concentration, the most significant changes were observed in enzymatic activity (except for butyrylcholinesterase), lipid peroxidation and in digestive gland morphometry. It was also registered increases of the filtering activity and the latency time to burial. Most of the biomarkers assessed showed significant responses under CLT exposure. Therefore, taking into account that C. largillierti was affected by CLT, it can be expected that other species could be in a potential risk if this fungicide is present in freshwater systems. © 2020 The Authors},

Crystal structures of their complexes with AChE and BChE revealed the molecular basis for their high potency. Brain penetration was confirmed by biodistribution studies in C57BL6 mice, with one compound (5i) displaying better brain/plasma ratio than donepezil. Chronic treatment of 10 month-old APP/PS1 mice with 5i (2 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times per week, 4 weeks) rescued learning and memory impairments, as measured by three different behavioral tests, delayed the Alzheimer-like pathology progression, as suggested by a significantly reduced Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in the hippocampus, improved basal synaptic efficacy, and significantly reduced hippocampal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

By exploiting a bioisosteric replacement of the indanone core of 1 with a 1,4-naphthoquinone, we ended up with a series of highly merged derivatives, in principle devoid of the “physicochemical challenge” typical of large hybrid-based MTDLs. A preliminary investigation of their multi-target profile identified 9, which showed a potent and selective butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, together with antioxidant and antiaggregating properties. In addition, it displayed a promising drug-like profile. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant health crisis, and current treatments provide only limited benefits to cognition at the cost of serious side effects. Recently, virtual screening techniques such as ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) and structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) have emerged as powerful drug discovery tools for identifying potential ligands of a biological target from a large database of chemical structures. The cholinesterases are an AD target particularly well suited for drug discovery using virtual screening due to their well-characterized active sites and comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships of existing inhibitors. Over the last 5 years (2015-2020), at least 15 studies have used virtual screening techniques to discover potent new cholinesterase inhibitors. Herein we review how LBVS and SBVS have been applied individually or in tandem to discover novel acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors for AD, and highlight the need to confirm in vitro activity of screening compounds. ©},

abstract={In recent years, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has gradually gained worldwide interests as a novel target for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, two pharmacophore models were generated using Schrödinger suite and used to virtually screen ChemDiv database, from which three hits were obtained. Among them, 2513–4169 displayed the highest inhibitory activity and selectivity against BChE (eeAChE IC50 &gt; 10 μM, eqBChE IC50 = 3.73 ± 1.90 μM). Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation validated the binding pattern of 2513–4169 in BChE, and it could form a various of receptor-ligand interactions with adjacent residues. In vitro cytotoxicity assay proved the safety of 2513–4169 on diverse neural cell lines. Moreover, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay performed on SH-SY5Y cells proved the neuroprotective effect of 2513–4169 against toxic Aβ1–42. In vivo behavioral study further confirmed the great efficacy of 2513–4169 on reversing Aβ1–42-induced cognitive impairment of mice and clearing the toxic Aβ1–42 in brains. Moreover, 2513–4169 was proved to be able to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB) through a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay of BBB (PAMPA-BBB). Taken together, 2513–4169 is a promising lead compound for future optimization to discover anti-AD treating agents. © 2020},

abstract={The pyridinium-2-carbaldoximes with quinolinium carboxamide moiety were designed and synthesised as cholinesterase reactivators. The prepared compounds showed intermediate-to-high inhibition of both cholinesterases when compared to standard oximes. Their reactivation ability was evaluated in vitro on human recombinant acetylcholinesterase (hrAChE) and human recombinant butyrylcholinesterase (hrBChE) inhibited by nerve agent surrogates (NIMP, NEMP, and NEDPA) or paraoxon. In the reactivation screening, one compound was able to reactivate hrAChE inhibited by all used organophosphates and two novel compounds were able to reactivate NIMP/NEMP-hrBChE. The reactivation kinetics revealed compound 11 that proved to be excellent reactivator of paraoxon-hrAChE better to obidoxime and showed increased reactivation of NIMP/NEMP-hrBChE, although worse to obidoxime. The molecular interactions of studied reactivators were further identified by in silico calculations. Molecular modelling results revealed the importance of creation of the pre-reactivation complex that could lead to better reactivation of both cholinesterases together with reducing particular interactions for lower intrinsic inhibition by the oxime. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={In the brain of patients with chronic Alzheimer's disease (AD), the butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) levels rise while the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels decrease. Therefore, development of new selective BuChE inhibitors is of vital importance. Here we present a series of bis(n)-lophine analogues, where two lophine derivatives are connected by a methylene chain. The bis(n)-lophine analogues were synthesized through one-pot four component reaction between pyridinecarboxaldehydes, 1,n-alkanediamines, benzil, and ammonium acetate. The reactions were performed in a microwave reactor in one step for symmetrical bis(n)-lophines, and in two steps for unsymmetrical bis(n)-lophines. The compounds are strongly selective to BuChE, since none of them inhibit AChE. All the compounds, except 7a, 7b and 7c, displayed potent inhibitory activity against BuChE at a micromolar and sub-micromolar range (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 32.25-0.03 μM). The enzyme kinetic and docking studies suggests that the inhibitor act as a dual binding site inhibitor, binding into the bottom of the gorge and in the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of BuChE cavity. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that compounds 5b and 12b had no cytotoxic effects in kidney Vero, hepatic HepG2 and C6 astroglial cell lines. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of cholinergic neurons. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition is a critical strategy for the treatment of AD since BChE causes inactivation of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and has positive effects on promoting the formation of β-amyloid fibrils. Our previous studies showed that various phenothiazine-derived compounds such as thionine and toluidine blue O (TBO) cause a potent inhibition of human cholinesterases. TBO was also found to affect amyloid precursor protein processing in-vitro and in-vivo models of AD. In this study, it was aimed to determine the inhibitory effect of 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue (DMMB), a phenothiazine-derived compound, on human plasma BChE and explore its inhibitory mechanism. The inhibition of human BChE was assessed by the colorimetric method of Ellman using butyrylthiocholine as substrate and 0-0.375 µM of DMMB. The kinetic findings showed that DMMB acts as a linear mixed-type inhibitor of human BChE with Ki value of 23 ± 0.004 nM and α= 3.6 ± 1.6. In conclusion, DMMB, which is a potent inhibitor effective at nM level, may be helpful in designing new cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of AD. © 2021, Turkish Chemical Society.

abstract={The Farmers are exposed to a wide range of pesticides. The application of these pesticides has been documented to lead to several adverse health effects. This aim of this case-control study was to estimate risks linked to pesticide exposure among farmers in the Souss region of Morocco through the analysis of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity and hematological parameters. This prospective study included 98 participants (49 farmers and 49 controls). A questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data, technical information regarding the application of pesticides, previous poisonings by pesticides, and training on the use of pesticides. The blood samples were collected for hematological parameters and BChE analysis, and the activity of BChE was measured spectrophotometrically by the butyrlthiocholine method. The results showed no significant differences in hemoglobin (HB), hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, red blood cell, and leukocyte cell counts between both the exposed farmer and the control group. In contrast, a significant decreased in mean corpuscular HB, mean corpuscular HB concentration, eosinophils, and basophils counts were observed. In addition, the exposed group showed a significant decrease in the BChE activity (p <.001) compared to the control group. Farmers exposed to pesticides in the Souss Massa region may be at risk of hematological alterations as well as neurotoxicity, characterized by inhibition of BChE enzyme activity. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex disorder with unknown etiology. Currently, only symptomatic therapy of AD is available, comprising cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-as-partate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Drugs targeting only one pathological condition have gener-ated only limited efficacy. Thus, combining two or more therapeutic interventions into one molecule is believed to provide higher benefit for the treatment of AD. In the presented study, we designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated 15 novel fluoren-9-amine derivatives. The in silico prediction suggested both the oral availability and permeation through the blood–brain barrier (BBB). An initial assessment of the biological profile included determination of the cholinesterase inhibition and NMDA receptor antagonism at the GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B subunits, along with a low cytotoxicity profile in the CHO-K1 cell line. Interestingly, compounds revealed a selective bu-tyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition pattern with antagonistic activity on the NMDARs. Their interaction with butyrylcholinesterase was elucidated by studying enzyme kinetics for compound 3c in tandem with the in silico docking simulation. The docking study showed the interaction of the tricyclic core of new derivatives with Trp82 within the anionic site of the enzyme in a similar way as the template drug tacrine. From the kinetic analysis, it is apparent that 3c is a competitive inhib-itor of BChE. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose: Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that exhibits distinct strain-related virulence patterns in mice. It can induce hepatic inflammation. The present study investigated MicroRNA-155 (miRNA-155) expression and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in the liver tissue of mice infected with virulent and avirulent strains of T. gondii. Methods: Mice groups included: Group (A), uninfected controls; Group (B), infected with T. gondii avirulent strain (ME-49) and euthanized 7, 27, 47, or 67 days post-infection (pi); Group (C), infected by T. gondii virulent strain (RH) and euthanized 7 days pi; and Group (D), infected by T. gondii virulent strain (RH), treated 24 h pi with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (150 mg/Kg/day and 30 mg/Kg/day, respectively) and euthanized 5, 10, or 20 days pi. miRNA-155 expression was estimated in the liver tissue using the reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction and the ΔΔCt method. BChE activity was estimated in liver homogenates by Ellman’s colorimetric method. Liver sections were examined histopathologically. Results: revealed a significant elevation in miRNA-155 expression and a significant reduction of BChE activity in all the infected untreated groups compared to the uninfected mice. In group B, the maximum upregulation of miRNA-155 expression and the least reduction in BChE activity were detected 7 days pi. In group D, complete restoration of normal levels occurred 20 days pi. Liver sections showed distinct histopathological patterns with detection of intracellular tachyzoites in group B. Conclusion: miRNA-155 and BChE play a role in regulating host-parasite interaction in toxoplasmosis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of T. gondii induced hepatic damage. © 2021, Witold Stefański Institute of Parasitology, Polish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of senile dementia, being responsible for most of the deaths of elderly people in developed countries. An important feature of AD is the loss of acetylcholine (ACh) in cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons. However, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is increased in amyloid plaques, which has been important in therapeutic strategy using AChE inhibitors, such as donepezil and galantamine. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) has less affinity for ACh compared to AChE, however its activity seems to be crucial for AD process with decline in AChE levels in the advanced stages of this desease. Thus, research with selective BuChE inhibitors has been increasing considerably as a new perspective for AD treatment. In this review we highlight synthetic and natural selective BuChE inhibitors, described as drug prototypes candidates for AD. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica. All rights reserved.},

In this study, novel chromone-lipoic acid hybrids were prepared to find a new multifunctional lead structure for the treatment of AD. Methods: Chromone-lipoic acid hybrids were prepared through click reaction and their neuroprotection and anticholinesterase activity were fully evaluated. The anti-amyloid aggregation, antioxidant and metal-chelation activities of the best compound were also investigated by standard methods to find a new multi-functional agent against AD. Results: The primary biological screening demonstrated that all compounds had significant neuroprotection activity against H2O2-induced cell damage in PC12 cells. Compound 19 as the most potent butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitor (IC50 = 7.55 μM) having significant neuroprotection activity as level as reference drug was selected for further biological evaluations. Docking and kinetic studies revealed non-competitive mixed-type inhibition of BuChE by compound 19. It could significantly reduce formation of the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and showed excellent reducing power (85.57 mM Fe+2), comparable with quercetin and lipoic acid. It could also moderately inhibit Aβ aggregation and selectively chelate with copper ions in 2:1 M ratio. Conclusion: Compound 19 could be considered as a hopeful multifunctional agent for the further development gainst AD owing to the acceptable neuroprotective and anti-BuChE activity, moderate anti-Aβ aggregation activity, outstanding antioxidant activity as well as selective copper chelation ability.

abstract={A series of C4-substituted tertiary nitrogen-bearing 2′-hydroxychalcones were designed and synthesised based on a previous mixed type acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Majority of the 2′-hydroxychalcone analogues displayed a better inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Among them, compound 4c was identified as the most potent AChE inhibitor (IC50: 3.3 µM) and showed the highest selectivity for AChE over BuChE (ratio &gt;30:1). Molecular docking studies suggested that compound 4c interacts with both the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic anionic site (CAS) regions of AChE. ADMET analysis confirmed the therapeutic potential of compound 4c based on its blood–brain barrier penetrating. Overall, the results suggest that this 2′-hydroxychalcone deserves further investigation into the therapeutic lead for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease conceptualized as a clinical-biological neurodegenerative construct where amyloid-beta pathophysiology is supposed to play a role. The loss of cognitive functions is mostly characterized by the rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine by cholinesterases including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Moreover, both enzymes are responsible for non-catalytic actions such as interacting with amyloid β peptide (Aβ) which further leads to promote senile plaque formation. In searching for a natural cholinesterase inhibitor, the present study focused on two isocoumarines from hydrangea, thunberginol C (TC) and hydrangenol 8-O-glucoside pentaacetate (HGP). Hydrangea-derived compounds were demonstrated to act as dual inhibitors of both AChE and BChE. Furthermore, the compounds exerted selective and non-competitive mode of inhibition via hydrophobic interaction with peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzymes. Overall results demonstrated that these natural hydrangea-derived compounds acted as selective dual inhibitors of AChE and BChE, which provides the possibility of potential source of new type of anti-cholinesterases with non-competitive binding property with PAS. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Chalcones, originated from natural product, have been broadly studied their biological activity against various proteins which at the molecular level, are responsible for the progress of the diseases in cancer (e.g. kinases), inflammation (oxidoreductases), atherosclero-sis (cathepsins receptor), and diabetes (e.g. α-glucosidase). Objective: Here we synthesize 10 chalcone derivatives to be evaluated their in vitro enzymatic inhibition activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Method: The synthesis was carried out using Claissen-Schimdt condensation and the in vitro assay was conducted using Ellman Method. Results: Compounds 2b and 4b demonstrated as the best IC50 of 9.3 µM and 68.7 µM respec-tively, towards AChE and BChE inhibition. Molecular docking studies predicted that this activity might be due to the interaction of the chalcones with important amino acid residues in the binding site of AChE such as SER200 and in that of BChE, such as TRP82, SER198, TRP430, TYR440, LEU286 and VAL288. Conclusion: Chalcone can be used as the scaffold for cholinesterase inhibitor, in particularly either fluorine or nitro group to be augmented at the para-position of Ring B, whereas the hydrophobic chain is necessary at the meta-position of Ring B. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Since 2002, no clinical candidate against Alzheimer's disease has reached the market; hence, an effective therapy is urgently needed. We followed the so-called "multitarget directed ligand"approach and designed 36 novel tacrine-phenothiazine heterodimers which were in vitro evaluated for their anticholinesterase properties. The assessment of the structure-activity relationships of such derivatives highlighted compound 1dC as a potent and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with IC50 = 8 nM and 1aA as a potent butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor with IC50 = 15 nM. Selected hybrids, namely, 1aC, 1bC, 1cC, 1dC, and 2dC, showed a significant inhibitory activity toward τ(306-336) peptide aggregation with percent inhibition ranging from 50.5 to 62.1%. Likewise, 1dC and 2dC exerted a remarkable ability to inhibit self-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation. Notwithstanding, in vitro studies displayed cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells and cerebellar granule neurons; no pathophysiological abnormality was observed when 1dC was administered to mice at 14 mg/kg (i.p.). 1dC was also able to permeate to the CNS as shown by in vitro and in vivo models. The maximum brain concentration was close to the IC50 value for acetylcholinesterase inhibition with a relatively slow elimination half-time. 1dC showed an acceptable safety and good pharmacokinetic properties and a multifunctional biological profile. ©},

abstract={Pesticides are frequently applied to agricultural activities to improve harvest, in terms of yield and product quality. Useful tools for ecotoxicological studies of marine ecosystems are based on biomarker application on bioindicator key fish species. The main aim of the present study was to detect the potential presence of pesticides in a polluted coastal marine environment, namely Milazzo Gulf, situated in the north eastern coast of Sicily (Italy), by measuring the enzymatic activities of the ecotoxicological biomarkers acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in brain and blood samples of Chelon labrosus. Also, Marinello Reserve was selected as a reference site. The data showed a significant inhibition in AChE (81%) and BChE (71%) activities in fish from Milazzo Gulf in respect to those from the reference site. The esterase inhibition is primarily due to the presence of organophosphorus insecticides and carbamates that resulted, in Milazzo Gulf, higher in concentration in respect to the reference quality standard decree (D.M. 260, 2010). The results obtained in this study confirm the suspected presence of insecticides in waters and fish from Milazzo Gulf, which may lead to a considerable hazard to humans. This study confirms the relevant advantages of the biomarker approach on fish species in the ecotoxicological evaluation of marine environments. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={The underlying cause of many metabolic diseases is abnormal changes in enzyme activity in metabolism. Inhibition of metabolic enzymes such as cholinesterases (ChEs; acetylcholinesterase, AChE and butyrylcholinesterase, BChE) and α-glucosidase (α-GLY) is one of the accepted approaches in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Here we reported an investigation of a new series of novel ureido-substituted derivatives with sulfamethazine backbone (2a-f) for the inhibition of AChE, BChE, and α-GLY. All the derivatives demonstrated activity in nanomolar levels as AChE, BChE, and α-GLY inhibitors with K I values in the range of 56.07–204.95 nM, 38.05–147.04 nM, and 12.80–79.22 nM, respectively. Among the many strong N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)-4-(3-substitutedphenylureido) benzenesulfonamide derivatives (2a-f) detected against ChEs, compound 2c, the 4-fluorophenylureido derivative, demonstrated the most potent inhibition profile towards AChE and BChE. A comprehensive ligand/receptor interaction prediction was performed in silico for the three metabolic enzymes providing molecular docking investigation using Glide XP, MM-GBSA, and ADME-Tox modules. The present research reinforces the rationale behind utilizing inhibitors with sulfamethazine backbone as innovative anticholinergic and antidiabetic agents with a new mechanism of action, submitting propositions for the rational design and synthesis of novel strong inhibitors targeting ChEs and α-GLY.

abstract={This study examined effect of berberine and piperine on neuroprotective potential of neostigmine in the management of neurological disorders. Berberine and neostigmine were weighed (30 g), dissolved in distilled water (30 mL) separately, while, 30 mg piperine was dissolved in ethanol (0.45 mL), made up to 30 mL with distilled water. Antioxidant activities in 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), 2, 2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical (ABTS), Fe-chelation, ferric reducing properties (FRAP), nitric oxide (NO) and hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging abilities and Fe2+, cisplatin and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) induced lipid peroxidation (LPO), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities were assessed in vitro. The result revealed that tested compounds inhibited enzymes activities dose-dependently. However, berberine (IC50=0.17 mg/mL) had slight higher AChE inhibitory effect than piperine and neostigmine (p<0.05). Also, berberine had the highest BChE inhibitory effect (IC50=0.16 mg/mL) while piperine exhibited the highest MAO inhibitory effect (IC50=0.21 mg/mL). Berberine, piperine and neostigmine exhibited high antioxidant properties and inhibited Fe2+, cisplatin and SNP induced LPO. Both alkaloids demonstrated antiradical scavenging ability comparable to neostigmine action against Alzheimer's disease (AD). The modulatory and antioxidant berberine and piperine properties on these enzymes (AChE, BChE and MAO) could be possible underlying mechanisms in employing these compounds as a complementary therapy in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) management. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={This dermal study tested the potential toxicity of grade 3 (G3) and 4 (G4) organophosphate-containing aircraft engine oils in both new (G3-N, G4-N) and used states (G3-U, G4-U) to alter esterase activities in blood, brain and liver tissues, clinical chemistry parameters, and electrophysiology of hippocampal neurons. A 300 µl volume of undiluted oil was applied in Hill Top Chamber Systems®, then attached to fur-free test sites on backs of male and female Sprague Dawley rats for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 21 days. Recovery rats received similar treatments and kept for 14 days post-exposure to screen for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxicity. In brain, both versions of G3 and G4 significantly decreased (32–41%) female acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity while in males only G3-N and G4-N reduced (33%) AChE activity. Oils did not markedly affect AChE in liver, regardless of gender. In whole blood, G3-U decreased female AChE (29%) which persisted during recovery (32%). G4-N significantly lowered (29%) butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in male plasma, but this effect was resolved during recovery. For clinical chemistry indices, only globulin levels in female plasma significantly increased following G3-N or G4-N exposure. Preliminary electrophysiology data suggested that effects of both versions of G3 and G4 on hippocampal function may be gender dependent. Aircraft maintenance workers may be at risk if precautions are not taken to minimize long-term aircraft oil exposure. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={A series of novel dopamine analogs incorporating urea and sulfonamide functional groups was synthesized from 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine. The reaction of 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine with N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl chloride, followed by the sulfonyl chlorination of the urea derivative, gave benzene-1-sulfonyl chloride 9, which was reacted with NH3 (aq) or N-alkyl amines to give related sulfonamides. The O-demethylation reaction of the subsequent compounds with BBr3 afforded four novel phenolic dopamine analogs including sulfonamide and urea in the same structure. The anticholinergic and antioxidant effects of the synthesized compounds were examined. Compound 13 exhibited inhibition at the micromolar level for both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The IC50 value of 13 was calculated as 298 ± 43 µM for AChE and 321 ± 29 µM for BChE. The antioxidant and antiradical effects of the molecules were investigated by five different methods. Among the synthesized compounds 10–18, the best antioxidant and antiradical activities belong to the phenolic compounds 15–18. Compounds 16 and 18 have a higher reducing power than the standards used, that is, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, Trolox, and α-tocopherol, for Fe3+–Fe2+ and Cu2+–Cu+ reducing activities. For the DPPH• radical scavenging method, compounds 16–18 have a much better scavenging power than the standard molecules. In addition, it has been determined by the induced-fit docking method that compound 13 is well-fitted in the active site of the enzymes. ADME studies reveal that the pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties of all synthesized compounds are within an acceptable range. © 2021 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft},

abstract={Carica papaya, commonly known as pawpaw, is a tropical plant cultivated for its edible ripe fruits. However, its leaf is being use traditionally against several life-threatening illnesses, including Alzheimer disease (AD). This study compared the cholinesterases (ChEs) inhibitory effect and antioxidant property of alkaloid and phenolic [aqueous, acetone and methanol-HCL (0.1:50 w/v)] rich extracts of Pawpaw leaf. The extracts were prepared to the concentration of 2 mg/mL, thereafter, effect on ChEs [acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)] activities, and production of quinolone (QA) and Fe-induced thiobarbituric reactive acid species (TBARS)] as well as antioxidant [ferric reducing antioxidant property (FRAP), 2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability] properties were determined. Total phenol and flavonoid contents of the phenolic-rich extracts, as well as gas chromatography analysis of an alkaloid extract, were carried out. Results revealed that hydromethanolic extract had the highest AChE inhibitory effect while aqueous extract had the highest BChE inhibitory potential. Hydromethanolic extract demonstrated highest inhibitory effect on Fe2+-induced TBARS production, while alkaloid extract had strong inhibition on QA-induced TBARS production. Aqueous extract had the highest total phenol content, while hydromethanolic extract had the highest total flavonoid content. All the extract exhibited anticholinesterases and antioxidant properties, however, hydromethanolic extract appears to be the most potent and could be as a result of its rich flavonoid content. The biological properties of the studied extract could be the underlying neuromodulatory mechanism of actions of pawpaw leaf in folklore against some neurological disorders. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The chemical ingredients of pine and thyme honey were studied, along with their medicinal activity properties. A method was validated for common honey compounds using LC-TOF/MS to analyze the ingredients. In vitro antiproliferative, antioxidant, anticholinesterase, anti-inflammatory, tyrosinase inhibitory, and urease inhibitory activities were used to investigate the therapeutic potentials. The antiproliferative activity was tested against HeLa, C6 (brain), PC3 (prostate), HT29 (colon), and MCF7 (breast) cancer cell lines while antioxidant activity using β-carotene-linoleic acid, DPPH, ABTS, and CUPRAC assays. Chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, protocatechuic acid, fumaric acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, gentisic acid, salicylic acid, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid were found in high amount in pine honey and less amount in thyme honey. Pine honey extracts and EtAc extract of thyme honey exhibited significant antiproliferative activity against PC3 and C6 cancer cell lines comparing to 5-fluorouracil. The ethyl acetate extracts of pine and thyme honey displayed essential and higher antioxidant activity than BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and α-TOC (α-tocopherol) in all tests. Moreover, the pine honey extracts were more active than that of thyme. The EtAc extracts of both honey extracts exhibited good enzyme inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activity. The ethyl acetate extracts were susceptible to inhibiting butyrylcholinesterase and urease enzymes. The honey studied herein can be said that they contain antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and urease inhibitory compounds, having many beneficial effects. The pine and/or thyme honey are consumed in meals due to their taste and aroma. The results showed that the honey samples, particularly pine honey, are medicinal foods that could be significant for humans who regularly consume them. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Context: Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken (Crassulaceae) is used traditionally to treat many ailments. Objectives: This study characterizes the constituents of B. pinnatum flavonoid-rich fraction (BPFRF) and investigates their antioxidant and anticholinesterase activity using in vitro and in silico approaches. Materials and methods: Methanol extract of B. pinnatum leaves was partitioned to yield the ethyl acetate fraction. BPFRF was isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction and purified. The constituent flavonoids were structurally characterized using UPLC-PDA-MS2. Antioxidant activity (DPPH), Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation (LP) and anticholinesterase activity (Ellman’s method) of the BPFRF and standards (ascorbic acid and rivastigmine) across a concentration range of 3.125–100μg/mL were evaluated in vitro for 4 months. Molecular docking was performed to give insight into the binding potentials of BPFRF constituents against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Results: UPLC-PDA-MS2 analysis of BPFRF identified carlinoside, quercetin (most dominant), luteolin, isorhamnetin, luteolin-7-glucoside. Carlinoside was first reported in this plant. BPFRF significantly inhibited DPPH radical (IC50 = 7.382 ± 0.79 µg/mL) and LP (IC50 = 7.182 ± 0.60 µg/mL) better than quercetin and ascorbic acid. Also, BPFRF exhibited potent inhibition against AChE and BuChE with IC50 values of 22.283 ± 0.27 µg/mL and 33.437 ± 1.46 µg/mL, respectively compared to quercetin and rivastigmine. Docking studies revealed that luteolin-7-glucoside, carlinoside and quercetin interact effectively with crucial amino acid residues of AChE and BuChE through hydrogen bonds. Discussion and conclusions: BPFRF possesses an excellent natural source of cholinesterase inhibitor and antioxidant. The material could be further explored for the potential treatment of oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Calendula officinalis L., commonly known as pot marigold, is a popular ornamental and highly medicinal plant. In fact, it is well recognized for its wide-ranging therapeutic effects conducive to wound healing and for treating various illnesses. In this study, the essential oils from flowers and leaves of C. officinalis were analysed for their chemical constituents and screened for their in vitro antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory properties. Thirty compounds were found in common in both essential oils, with the sesquiterpene alcohol, α-cadinol as the most abundant compound (leaf: 32.3% and flower: 31.3%, respectively). Besides, the essential oils were found to possess antioxidant capacity through free radical scavenging and reducing mechanisms (DPPH: 2.94, 1.52 mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g of oil; ABTS: 20.72, 2.86 mg TE/g; CUPRAC: 31.16, 47.98 mg TE/g; FRAP: 24.84, 23.42 mg TE/g; phosphomolybdenum: 4.01, 4.68 mmol TE/g for leaves and flowers essential oils, respectively). Moreover, the essential oils (leaves and flowers, respectively) were found to inhibit all the tested enzymes, namely amylase (0.46, 0.42 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g), glucosidase (1.35, 1.31 mmol ACAE/g), acetylcholinesterase (2.48, 2.36 mg galantamine (GALAE)/g) and butyrylcholinesterase (8.13, 8.20 mg GALAE/g) and tyrosinase (47.73, 54.36 mg kojic acid equivalent/g). Molecular docking was also performed revealing the compounds neophytadiene and α-humulene to show the highest binding affinity with tyrosinase. Therefore, the obtained results demonstrated some appealing activities of C officinalis essential oils as natural pharmacological agents that could be valuable for the potential development of phyto-formulations against the herein targeted diseases and especially for cosmeceutical applications. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: Exponential expansion in the usage of herbal medicines was observed in recent decades due to the increasing importance of the traditionally used natural remedies. In order to identify bioactive components of medicinal value, in the present study, we aimed to screen different extracts of Hemidesmus indicus (L.) R. Br. ex Schult for health beneficial effect by exploring its biological properties and phytochemical profile. Methods: By using sequential extraction method, H. indicus roots were extracted with various solvents based on low to high polarity. Subsequently, quantitative phytochemical profiling, antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities were tested by using standard protocols. The MTT assay was carried out in SHSY-5Y cell lines to evaluate anti-inflammatory effect. Results: Methanol extract displayed highest phytochemical content with high concentration of terpenoid (59.82±0.97 mg LE/g of extract) and saponin (15.03±0.45 mg DE/g of extract). All the extracts exhibited concentration dependent pharmacological activities. In comparison, methanol extract produced highest activities with IC50 of 15.21±0.31 and 11.36±0.39 μg/ml against NO and DPPH radical scavenging assays respectively. Also, methanol extract showed maximum inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (IC50=17.46±0.49 μg/ml) and butyrylcholinesterase (IC50=31.05±0.39 μg/ml), however, aqueous extract displayed highest potency against monoamine oxidase-B inhibition (IC50=24.60±0.45 μg/ml). At 12.5-100 μg/mL concentrations, methanol and aqueous extracts did not show any cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y cells and dose dependently suppressed TNF-α and IL-6 production. Conclusion: Collectively, H. indicus could act as a disease modifying therapeutic in pharmaceutical industries by utilizing it as alternative therapy for the management of oxidative stress and its related disorders. © 2021 Phcogj.Com.

abstract={Cholinesterases are significant biological targets for the regulation of cholinergic neurotransmission, and their inhibitors are being exploited for the management of cognitive decline in various neurological conditions. The 1,4-benzoquinone scaffold possesses antioxidant potential along with AChE inhibition activity in various neurological disorders. To design novel and potent selective 1,4-benzoquinone analogues as cholinesterase inhibitors, a ligand-based drug design strategy was followed to develop a 3D quantitative structure-selectivity relationship (QSSR) model. On the basis of the best fit model, eight novel 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives were designed and synthesized implementing appropriate synthetic procedures and were characterized by various spectral and elemental techniques. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their selective in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory potential at different concentrations using mice brain homogenate as the source of the enzyme. Out of these compounds, the three most selective compounds were further evaluated for behavioral variations using step down passive avoidance and escape learning procedure at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg taking donepezil as the reference drug. Biochemical estimation of the markers of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase) has also been carried out to determine the role of the synthesized molecules on the scopolamine induced oxidative damage. Compound 2a displayed appreciable selectivity index values as predicted through the 3D-QSSR model. Further, docked complexes of compound 2a with AChE and BChE were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations for a period of 30 ns to study the orientations and stable conformations of the most active molecules in the catalytic domain of these enzymes. The results obtained from the 3D-QSSR analysis, docking, and molecular dynamic studies were found to be appreciable and provided a deep insight into the structural features required for the selectivity of AChE inhibitors over BChE. The outcome of this study may be used as a novel tool to design new highly selective and more potent molecules. ©},

abstract={Purpose: The increase in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and animal models of AD position this enzyme as a potential biomarker of the disease. However, the information on the ability of BChE to serve as AD biomarker is contradicting, also due to scarce longitudinal studies of BChE activity abundance. Here, we report 11C-labeling, in vivo stability, biodistribution, and longitudinal study on BChE abundance in the brains of control and 5xFAD (AD model) animals, using a potent BChE selective inhibitor, [11C]4, and positron emission tomography (PET) in combination with computerised tomography (CT). We correlate the results with in vivo amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, longitudinally assessed by [18F]florbetaben-PET imaging. Methods: [11C]4 was radiolabelled through 11C-methylation. Metabolism studies were performed on blood and brain samples of female wild type (WT) mice. Biodistribution studies were performed in female WT mice using dynamic PET-CT imaging. Specific binding was demonstrated by ex vivo and in vivo PET imaging blocking studies in female WT and 5xFAD mice at the age of 7 months. Longitudinal PET imaging of BChE was conducted in female 5xFAD mice at 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months of age and compared to age-matched control animals. Additionally, Aβ plaque distribution was assessed in the same mice using [18F]florbetaben at the ages of 2, 5, 7 and 11 months. The results were validated by ex vivo staining of BChE at 4, 8, and 12 months and Aβ at 12 months on brain samples. Results: [11C]4 was produced in sufficient radiochemical yield and molar activity for the use in PET imaging. Metabolism and biodistribution studies confirmed sufficient stability in vivo, the ability of [11C]4 to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and rapid washout from the brain. Blocking studies confirmed specificity of the binding. Longitudinal PET studies showed increased levels of BChE in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum and brain stem in aged AD mice compared to WT littermates. [18F]Florbetaben-PET imaging showed similar trend of Aβ plaques accumulation in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus of AD animals as the one observed for BChE at ages 4 to 8 months. Contrarily to the results obtained by ex vivo staining, lower abundance of BChE was observed in vivo at 10 and 12 months than at 8 months of age. Conclusions: The BChE inhibitor [11C]4 crosses the BBB and is quickly washed out of the brain of WT mice. Comparison between AD and WT mice shows accumulation of the radiotracer in the AD-affected areas of the brain over time during the early disease progression. The results correspond well with Aβ accumulation, suggesting that BChE is a promising early biomarker for incipient AD. © The author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: Dyslipidemia is an emerging metabolic disorder among pesticide-exposed agricultural workers, and this study was aimed to explore biomarkers of hypertriglyceridaemia susceptibility. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 72 pesticide-exposed subjects and 78 non-exposed controls. Lipid profile, cholinesterase activity, and thyroid hormones were analysed with routine assays. Six loci, including rs11206244 and rs2235544 for deiodinase 1, rs12885300 and rs225014 for deiodinase 2, rs1803274 for butyrylcholinesterase, and rs3757869 for acetylcholinesterase were genotyped using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Results: Pesticide-exposed subjects showed higher levels of triglyceride than controls (p = 0.009), although there were comparable cholinesterase activity and genotype frequencies of all six loci between pesticide-exposed subjects and controls. Pesticide-exposed subjects with homozygous genotype of cholinesterase had increased triglyceride levels than controls (p < 0.05). The percentage of hypertriglyceridaemia was 28.6% and 8.8% for pesticide-exposed subjects and controls with homozygous butyrylcholinesterase genotype (p = 0.007) and 20.8% and 14.3% with homozygous acetylcholinesterase genotype (p = 0.792), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses found that odds ratio of hypertriglyceridaemia is 21.92 and 4.56 for pesticide-exposed subjects with homozygous genotype of butyrylcholinesterase (p = 0.001) and acetylcholinesterase (p = 0.036), respectively. Conclusions: Cholinesterase homozygous genotype might be a potential susceptible biomarker in screening pesticide-exposed agricultural workers vulnerable to hypertriglyceridaemia. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={A new series of quinoxalin-1,3,4-oxadiazole (10a–l) derivatives was synthesized and evaluated against some metabolic enzymes including human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) isoenzymes I and II (carbonic anhydrases I and II), cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase), and α-glucosidase. Obtained data revealed that all the synthesized compounds were more potent as compared with the used standard inhibitors against studied target enzymes. Among the synthesized compounds, 4-fluoro derivative (10f) against hCA I, 4-chloro derivative (10i) against hCA II, 3-fluoro derivative (10e) against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, and 3-bromo derivative (10k) against α-glucosidase were the most potent compounds with inhibitory activity around 1.8- to 7.37-fold better than standard inhibitors. Furthermore, docking studies of these compounds were performed at the active site of their target enzymes. © 2021 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft},

abstract={Enhydra fluctuans, a popular vegetable in Bangladesh, is used in folk medicine to treat diseases of the nervous system. The objective of this study was to investigate the phytochemical profile and cholinesterase inhibitory and antioxidant potential of the extracts of E. fluctuans. Among the four tested extracts, the chloroform extract was found to exert the highest inhibition against both the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes with the IC50 (concentration required for 50% inhibition) values of 83.90 μg/mL and 48.14 μg/mL, respectively. Likewise, the chloroform extract showed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. In DPPH radical scavenging assay, the IC50 value was found to be 113.27 μg/mL, and in reducing power assay, the absorbance was found to be 1.916 at a concentration of 50 μg/mL. Phytochemical analyses revealed that the chloroform extract contained 19.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract of phenolics and 41.84 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g extract of flavonoids, which appeared to be the highest among the extracts. A significant correlation was observed between phenolic content and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activity, while a moderate correlation was seen between flavonoid content and cholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activity. These findings suggest that E. fluctuans is a natural source of cholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidants, which could be utilized as functional foods for Alzheimer's disease management. © 2021 Simin Shabnam Lopa et al.},

abstract={Washingtonia filifera seeds have revealed to possess antioxidant properties, butyrylcholinesterase and xanthine oxidase inhibition activities. The literature has indicated a relationship between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Keeping this in mind, we have now evaluated the inhibitory properties of W. filifera seed extracts on α-amylase, α-glucosidase enzyme activity and the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP) fibrils formation. Three extracts from seeds of W. filifera were evaluated for their enzyme inhibitory effect and IC50 values were calculated for all the extracts. The inhibition mode was investigated by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis and the inhibition of IAPP aggregate formation was monitored. W. filifera methanol seed extract appears as the most potent inhibitor of α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and for the IAPP fibril formation. Current findings indicate new potential of this extract that could be used for the identification or development of novel potential agents for T2D and AD. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={The organophosphate (OP) pesticides are neurotoxic compounds widely used around the world. Evaluation of OP exposure in human studies is important for enabling adequate data analyses and drawing accurate conclusions. The aim of this study was to analyze OP exposure biomarkers and their relationships in a Mexican population with different exposure levels. Dialkylphosphates (DAP) were determined through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MSD); acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), arylesterase (AREase), basal paraoxonase 1 (PONase), and β-glucuronidase activities were detected using spectrophotometric methods. The albumin content was determined in a certified clinical laboratory. The DMTP metabolite was found in the highest concentration, and a negative and significant correlation between DAP and cholinesterase activity was observed. Our results suggested that BuChE is a considerably more sensitive biomarker than AChE. In addition, β-glucuronidase was positively correlated with albumin, BuChE, and PONase. In conclusion, our data strongly support the use of two or more biomarkers of exposure in human monitoring and the application of a strong and validated questionnaire. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a reason for the lack of effective drugs as well as a basis for the development of "multi-target-directed ligands"(MTDLs). As cases increase in developing countries, there is a need of new drugs that are not only effective but also accessible. With this motivation, we report the first sustainable MTDLs, derived from cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL), an inexpensive food waste with anti-inflammatory properties. We applied a framework combination of functionalized CNSL components and well-established acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) tacrine templates. MTDLs were selected based on hepatic, neuronal, and microglial cell toxicity. Enzymatic studies disclosed potent and selective AChE/BChE inhibitors (5, 6, and 12), with subnanomolar activities. The X-ray crystal structure of 5 complexed with BChE allowed rationalizing the observed activity (0.0352 nM). Investigation in BV-2 microglial cells revealed antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective activities for 5 and 6 (already at 0.01 μM), confirming the design rationale. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

abstract={Inspired by the structures of donepezil and rivastigmine, a novel series of indanone–carbamate hybrids was synthesized using the pharmacophore hybridization-based design strategy, and their biological activities toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase were evaluated. Among the synthesized compounds, 4d and 4b showed the highest AChE inhibitory activities with IC50 values in the micromolar range (compound 4d: IC50 = 3.04 μM; compound 4b: IC50 = 4.64 μM). Moreover, the results of the Aβ1–40 aggregation assay revealed that compound 4b is a potent Aβ1–40 aggregation inhibitor. The kinetics of AChE enzymatic activity in the presence of 4b was investigated, and the results were indicative of a reversible partial noncompetitive type of inhibition. A molecular docking study was conducted to determine the possible allosteric binding mode of 4b with the enzyme. The allosteric nature of AChE inhibition by these compounds provides the opportunity for the design of subtype-selective enzyme inhibitors. The presented indanone–carbamate scaffold can be structurally modified and optimized through medicinal chemistry-based approaches for designing novel multitargeted anti-Alzheimer agents. © 2021 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft},

abstract={Intoxication by organophosphorus (OP) poisons, like nerve agents and pesticides, is characterized by the life-threatening inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) caused by covalent reaction with the serine residue of the active site of the enzyme (phosphylation). Similar reactions occur with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and serum albumin present in blood as dissolved proteins. For forensic purposes, products (adducts) with the latter proteins are highly valuable long-lived biomarkers of exposure to OP agents that are accessible by diverse mass spectrometric procedures. In addition, the evidence of poison incorporation might also succeed by the detection of remaining traces of the agent itself, but more likely its hydrolysis and/or enzymatic degradation products. These relatively short-lived molecules are distributed in blood and tissue, and excreted via urine. This review presents the mass spectrometry-based methods targeting the different groups of biomarkers in biological samples, which are already internationally accepted by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), introduces novel approaches in the field of biomedical verification, and outlines the strict quality criteria that must be fulfilled for unambiguous forensic analysis. © 2021 THE AUTHORS},

abstract={A new series of 3-O-substituted xanthone derivatives were synthesised and evaluated for their anti-cholinergic activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The results indicated that the xanthone derivatives possessed good AChE inhibitory activity with eleven of them (5, 8, 11, 17, 19, 21-23, 26-28) exhibited significant effects with the IC50 values ranged 0.88 to 1.28 µM. The AChE enzyme kinetic study of 3-(4-phenylbutoxy)-9H-xanthen-9-one (23) and ethyl 2-((9-oxo-9H-xanthen-3-yl)oxy)acetate (28) showed a mixed inhibition mechanism. Molecular docking study showed that 23 binds to the active site of AChE and interacts via extensive π–π stacking with the indole and phenol side chains of Trp86 and Tyr337, besides the hydrogen bonding with the hydration site and π–π interaction with the phenol side chain of Y72. This study revealed that 3-O-alkoxyl substituted xanthone derivatives are potential lead structures, especially 23 and 28 which can be further developed into potent AChE inhibitors. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={A new series of pyrazole, phenylpyrazole, and pyrazoline analogs of diarylpentanoids (excluding compounds 3a, 4a, 5a, and 5b) was pan-assay interference compounds-filtered and synthesized via the reaction of diarylpentanoids with hydrazine monohydrate and phenylhydrazine. Each analog was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory ability via the suppression of nitric oxide (NO) on IFN-γ/LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The compounds were also investigated for their inhibitory capability toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), using a modification of Ellman's spectrophotometric method. The most potent NO inhibitor was found to be phenylpyrazole analog 4c, followed by 4e, when compared with curcumin. In contrast, pyrazole 3a and pyrazoline 5a were found to be the most selective and effective BChE inhibitors over AChE. The data collected from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of compound 5a were then applied in a docking simulation to determine the potential binding interactions that were responsible for the anti-BChE activity. The results obtained signify the potential of these pyrazole and pyrazoline scaffolds to be developed as therapeutic agents against inflammatory conditions and Alzheimer's disease. © 2020 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft},

abstract={Impaired glucose utilization has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. The neuroprotective effect of caffeic acid (CA) was investigated in the isolated rat brain by determining its ability to promote glucose uptake, mitigate redox imbalance, modulate purinergic and cholinergic activities, elemental distribution, and maintain tissue morphology. Isolated rat brains were incubated for 2 hours with glucose, CA and glucose, and metformin and glucose. There was an increased glucose uptake, glutathione level, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities in brain tissues incubated with CA compared to the controls. Incubation with CA also led to significantly decreased levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and ATPase activities. Electron microscopy (scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) analysis portrayed a maintenance of tissue ultrastructural morphology in 2CA-incubated tissues as indicated by the intact synaptic vesicles, blood vessels, dendritic and neuronal network, mitochondria, and presynaptic membrane. CA also restored altered elemental levels in brain tissues. These results indicate the stimulatory potential of CA on brain glucose utilization with simultaneous neuroprotective activities. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={In the work, the possibility of using nanoparticles of gold (AuNPs) to upgrade bioselective elements of biosensors in order to improve their analytical characteristics is considered. The bioselective elements of biosensors based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyryl cholinesterase (BuChE) and glucose oxidase (GOD) were used as an experimental model. Immobilization of enzymes on the surfaces of conductometric transducers was performed by the crosslinking of corresponding enzymes using glutaraldehyde. The conditions of immobilization of AChE with gold nanoparticles were optimized. Thus, we determined the optimal values of concentration of crosslinking agent (glutaraldehyde), duration of immobilization, the enzyme to AuNPs ratio, the AuNPs concentration and size. The performance characteristics of the biosensors based on enzymes and AuNPs were investigated and compared with the characteristics of biosensors based on enzymes only. It was also examined how the addition of AuNPs to the bioselective element of biosensors affects the biosensor stability. In particular, the reproducibility of preparation and continuous operation of biosensors was tested as well as their stability at storage. It was shown that the presence of AuNPs in the composition of bioselective elements can improve some characteristics of biosensors, which may be promising for further study and use. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

abstract={Objectives: Several studies had been conducted to examine the link between diabetes and diabetes encephalopathy. This study was conducted to examine the potency of berberine (BER) on the restoration of impaired neurochemicals in the brain of streptozotocin (STZ)induced diabetic Wistar rats. Methods: Fifty-six (56) adult rats weighing between 200 and 230 g were randomly divided into seven groups (n=8) as follows; Group I is normal control; Groups II and III were normal rats treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg respectively; Group IV-VII were STZ-induced rats, but Groups V-VII were treated with acarbose (25 mg/kg), 50 and 100 mg/kg of BER, respectively. Results: The result of the study showed that untreated STZ-induced diabetic rats have increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities, and malonylaldehyde (MDA) level, with concomitant decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and glutathione (GSH) level. However, daily treatment with 50 and 100 mg/kg BER and ACA significantly reversed these effects. Conclusions: The findings of this study clearly indicated that BER possesses neuro-protective and antioxidative potentials and normalize neurochemical impairment distort by diabetes. © 2021 De Gruyter.

abstract={Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the foremost public health problems. Alcohol is also frequently co-abused with cocaine. There is a huge unmet need for the treatment of AUD and/or cocaine co-abuse. We recently demonstrated that skin grafts generated from mouse epidermal stem cells that had been engineered by CRISPR-mediated genome editing could be transplanted onto mice as a gene delivery platform. Here, we show that expression of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) gene delivered by epidermal stem cells attenuated development and reinstatement of alcohol-induced drug-taking and seeking as well as voluntary oral alcohol consumption. GLP1 derived from the skin grafts decreased alcohol-induced increase in dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. In exploring the potential of this platform in reducing concurrent use of drugs, we developed a novel co-grafting procedure for both modified human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE)- and GLP1-expressing cells. Epidermal stem cell-derived hBChE and GLP1 reduced acquisition of drug-taking and toxicity induced by alcohol and cocaine co-administration. These results imply that cutaneous gene delivery through skin transplants may add a new option to treat drug abuse and co-abuse. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease is considered the most common cause of dementia and, in an increasingly aging population worldwide, the quest for treatment is a priority. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are of main interest because of their cholinesterase inhibition potential, which is the main palliative treatment available for this disease. We evaluated the alkaloidal profile and the in vitro inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) of bulb alkaloid extract of Phaedranassa dubia and Phaedranassa brevifolia collected in Ecuador. Using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we identified typical Amaryllidaceae alkaloids in these species, highlighting the presence of lycorine-type alkaloids in P. dubia and haemanthamine/crinine-type in P. brevifolia. The species P. dubia and P. brevifolia showed inhibitory activities against AChE (IC50 values of 25.48 ± 0.39 and 3.45 ± 0.29 μg.mL−1, respectively) and BuChE (IC50 values of 114.96 ± 4.94 and 58.89 ± 0.55 μg.mL−1, respectively). Computational experiments allowed us to understand the interactions of the alkaloids identified in these samples toward the active sites of AChE and BuChE. In silico, some alkaloids detected in these Amaryllidaceae species presented higher estimated binding free energy toward BuChE than galanthamine.

abstract={A novel series of tacrine based cyclopentapyranopyridine- and tetrahydropyranoquinoline-kojic acid derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as anti-cholinesterase agents. The chemical structures of all target compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and elemental analyses. The synthesized compounds mostly inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) with IC50 values of 4.18–48.71 μM rather than butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE) with IC50 values of &gt;100 μM. Among them, cyclopentapyranopyridine-kojic acid derivatives showed slightly better AChE inhibitory activity compared to tetrahydropyranoquinoline-kojic acid. The compound 10-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-11-(4-isopropylphenyl)-7,8,9,11-tetrahydro-4H-cyclopenta[b]pyrano[2′,3′ : 5,6]pyrano[3,2-e]pyridin-4-one (6f) bearing 4-isopropylphenyl moiety and cyclopentane ring exhibited the highest anti-AChE activity with IC50 value of 4.18 μM. The kinetic study indicated that the compound 6f acts as a mixed inhibitor and the molecular docking studies also illustrated that the compound 6f binds to both the catalytic site (CS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The compound 6f showed moderate neuroprotective properties against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. The theoretical ADME study also predicted good drug-likeness for the compound 6f.

abstract={Senecio hercynicus Herborg. (Asteraceae) is a perennial plant containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids and sesquiterpene lactones due to which it has analgesic, hypoglycaemic and insecticidal properties. Herein, a phytochemical profile of S. hercynicus together with an assessment of the antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory potential, is presented. The herbal drugs (flower heads, aerial parts and roots) were collected on Vitosha Mt., Bulgaria. The methanol-aqueous extracts were analyzed by UHPLCHRMS and then 60 phenolic compounds comprising hydroxybenzoic, hydroxycinnamic acids and glycosides, sugar esters, acylquinic acids and flavonoids were identified or tentatively elucidated. The highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents were found in the flower heads (41:53 ± 1:17 mgGAE/g and 10:01 ± 0:10 mgRE/g, respectively). Accordingly, flower heads revealed the most pronounced radical scavenging activity (94.93 mgTE/g DPPH and 164.97 mgTE/g ABTS), reducing power (183.34 mgTE/g CUPRAC) and antioxidant potential in phosphomolybdenum assay (1.12 mmol TE/g). The highest metal-chelating capacity was found for the aerial parts (79:39 ± 2:58 mg EDTAE/g). Flower heads and roots extracts exhibited prominent acetylcholinesterase (4.02 mg GALAE/g) and butyrylcholinesterase (4.00 mg GALAE/g) inhibitory activity, respectively. The highest α-glucosidase inhibition (1:16 ± 0:07 mmolACAE/ g) was registered for the flower heads. The study indicated that S. hercynicus flower heads extracts could be focus of further phytopharmacological research. © 2020 Academic Publishing House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Human carboxylesterase 2 (hCES2A), one of the major serine hydrolases distributed in the small intestine, plays a crucial role in hydrolysis of ester-bearing drugs. Accumulating evidence has indicated that hCES2A inhibitor therapy can modulate the pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of some important hCES2A-substrate drugs, such as the anticancer agent CPT-11. Herein, a series of indanone–chalcone hybrids are designed and synthesized to find potent and highly selective hCES2A inhibitors. Inhibition assays demonstrated that most indanone–chalcone hybrids displayed strong to moderate hCES2A inhibition activities. Structure-hCES2A inhibition activity relationship studies showed that introduction of a hydroxyl at the C4’ site and introduction of an N-alkyl group at the C6 site were beneficial for hCES2A inhibition. Particularly, B7 (an N-alkylated 1-indanone–chalcone hybrid) exhibited the most potent inhibition on hCES2A and excellent specificity (this agent could not inhibit other human esterases including hCES1A and butyrylcholinesterase). Inhibition kinetic analyses demonstrated that B7 potently inhibited hCES2A-mediated FD hydrolysis in a mixed inhibition manner, with a calculated Ki value of 0.068 μM. Furthermore, B7 was capable of inhibiting intracellular hCES2A in living cells and displayed good metabolic stability. Collectively, our findings show that indanone–chalcone hybrids are good choices for the development of hCES2A inhibitors, while B7 is a promising candidate for the development of novel anti-diarrhea agents to ameliorate irinotecan-induced intestinal toxicity. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={This study aimed to compare the phenolic profiles, enzyme inhibitory activity and antioxidant activity of the bulb, stem and flower parts of Allium paniculatum subsp. villosulum and Allium paniculatum subsp. paniculatum. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts were spectrophotometrically determined, and the bulb (21.88 mg GAE/g extract) and flower (2.89 mg QE/g extract) parts of A. paniculatum subsp. villosulum were detected with the highest levels. Quantification of selected phenolic compounds was performed using LC–ESI–MS/MS, and p-coumaric acid (981.9, 952.6 μg/gram extract) was the major compound of both plants. Antioxidant properties of the extracts were evaluated in terms of radical scavenging (DPPH, ABTS) and reducing power (CUPRAC, FRAP) activities, and the highest values were observed in the bulb parts of the plants. Acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and tyrosinase inhibitory activities of the extracts were determined using a 96-well microplate reader. The flower (IC50 11.72 and 8.43 µg/ml) and stem parts (IC50 49.16 µg/ml) of A. paniculatum subsp. villosulum were the most potent samples. In addition, the results of the analyses were further evaluated and verified by principal component analysis.

abstract={Nowadays, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have been a very crucial issue for pharmacological treatments of several disasters. Herein, we investigated inhibition effects of Tamoxifen (TAM), Isoprenaline (ISO), Chlorpromazines (CPZ) and Carbamazepine (CBZ) on GST, AChE, BChE and then molecular structures and active sides of the tested drugs by molecular docking process. The enzyme activity results showed that nearly the whole tested drugs inhibited GST, BChE, AChE efficiently. Chlorpromazine was found to be the best inhibitor for the GST enzyme and the Ki value of this drug was found to be 42.83 ± 8.52 nM. Besides, Isoproterenol drug with the Ki value of 51.80 ± 9.44 nM was found to be the most effective inhibitor on the AChE enzyme. Molecular docking studies showed that the receptor-binding sites of GST, AChE, and BChE were found to 1.069, 1.090, and 1.15 of Sitecore and 0.992, 1.113, and 1.217 of Dscore, respectively. The method was validated by doing validation studies and these validations revealed that re-docked ligands located a very closed position with co-crystallized ligand into the active site for all receptors. Calculation studies for determining the possible enzyme inhibition mechanism with the used drugs revealed that amino and aromatic ring in the structure of the drugs used are effective in inhibition reactions.

abstract={In search of suitable therapy for the management of Alzheimer’s disease, this study was designed to evaluate metal complexes against its biochemical targets. Zinc metal carboxylates (AAZ1–AAZ6) were evaluated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The antioxidant in combination with anticholinesterase activity can be considered as an important target in the management of Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, these compounds were also screened for ABTS and DPPH free radical scavenging activity. In AChE inhibition assay, we noticed encouraging IC50 values of 33.07 and 59.52 µM for compounds AAZ5 and AAZ3, respectively. However, when we tested BChE activity, we observed an outstanding IC50 of 0.056 µM for compound AAZ6. Amazingly all of our compounds (AAZ1–AAZ6) were proved to be strong antioxidants which actively supplement the anti-Alzheimer’s activity. The majority of our compounds exhibited lower IC50 values than the standard ascorbic acid in both DPPH and ABTS assays. We also correlated our results with molecular docking studies. Results elaborated that AAZ1 and AAZ5 exhibit strong interactions with amino acids HIS 362, HIS 398, GLU 306 ARG 289 and SER 237 inside binding pocket of targeted protein. In remarks, we can claim that our synthesized zinc metal carboxylates have strong potency to manage Alzheimer’s disease on both anticholinesterase and antioxidant targets.

abstract={In this study, preparation, as well as investigation of α-glycosidase and cholinesterase (ChE) enzyme inhibition activities of furan-2-ylmethoxy-substituted compounds 1–7, are reported. Peripherally, tetra-substituted copper and manganese phthalocyanines (5 and 6) were synthesized for the first time. The substitution of furan-2-ylmethoxy groups provides remarkable solubility to the complex and redshift of the phthalocyanines Q-band. Besides, the inhibitory effects of these compounds on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and α-glycosidase (α-Gly) enzymes have been investigated. The AChE was inhibited by these compounds (1–7) in low micromolar levels, and Ki values were recorded between 11.17 ± 1.03 and 83.28 ± 11.08 µM. Against the BChE, the compounds demonstrated Ki values from 7.55 ± 0.98 to 81.35 ± 12.80 µM. Also, these compounds (1–7) effectively inhibited α-glycosidase, with Ki values in the range of 744.87 ± 67.33 to 1094.38 ± 88.91 µM. For α-glycosidase, the most effective Ki values of phthalocyanines 3 and 6 were with Ki values of 744.87 ± 67.33 and 880.36 ± 56.77 µM, respectively. Moreover, the studied metal complexes were docked with target proteins PDB ID: 4PQE, 1P0I, and 3WY1. Pharmacokinetic parameters and secondary chemical interactions that play an active role in interaction were predicted with docking simulation results. Overall, furan-2-ylmethoxy-substituted phthalocyanines can be considered as potential agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases and diabetes mellitus. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Meteloxetin (1), a new phenolic amino-oxetane, and eight known new source phenols (2–9) have been bioassay-directed isolated from methanolic extract of Datura metel Linn. Their structures were elucidated through modern spectroscopic data. The plant extract showed the significant inhibition potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and its dichloromethane (DCM) fraction exhibited the remarkable inhibition potentials against AChE with IC50 (inhibition concentration) value 1.32 ± 0.02 µg/ml and BChE with IC50 value 1.13 ± 0.01 µg/ml, when compared with the standard drug eserine (AChE, IC50 0.04 ± 0.01 µg/ml) and galanthamine (BChE, IC50 0.92 ± 0.01 µg/ml). The bioactive DCM fraction was subjected to systematic isolation protocol to isolate the 1–9 compounds, and all were subjected to evaluate their AChE and BChE inhibition potentials. From these isolates, compound 1 showed the effective inhibition potential against BChE with IC50 value 0.84 ± 0.03 µg/ml and excellent inhibition potential against AChE with IC50 value 0.07 ± 0.02 µg/ml. This strong inhibition potential of 1 is due to the presence of amino-oxetane groups in it. The in silico studies indicate that oxetane rings contain high-energy oxygen, which makes it a marvelous pharmacophore with diverse biological potentials. The potent nature of compound 1 has also been evaluated by exploring its electronic properties, molecular electrostatic potential and Hirshfeld analysis by density functional theory. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={Insecticides used for agricultural pest control, as cypermethrin-based insecticide (CBI) and fipronil-based insecticide (FBI), are constant threats to non-target aquatic organisms. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different concentrations of cypermethrin and fipronil on neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in Physalaemus gracilis. Physalaemus gracilis tadpoles were exposed to five insecticide concentrations and a control treatment, with six replicates. During the experimental period, the tadpole mortality rate was evaluated and after 168 h, the neurotoxic enzyme activity and metabolite quantification related to the antioxidant system were measured. Tadpoles reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities when exposed to 20 μg L−1 CBI and at all FBI concentrations, respectively. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities showed an increase from concentrations of 6 μg L−1 and 20 μg L−1 of CBI, respectively. After exposure of P. gracilis tadpoles to FBI, inhibitions of AChE and BChE were observed at the highest concentrations evaluated (500 and 1500 μg L−1). SOD activity decreased from 50 μg L−1 of FBI; however, catalase (CAT) and GST activities and carbonyl protein levels increased, regardless of the evaluated dose. We observed that both insecticides promoted oxidative stress and neurotoxic effects in P. gracilis tadpoles. These results suggest that biochemical biomarkers can be used for monitoring toxicity insecticides for the purpose of preservation of P. gracilis. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Farmers represent a population highly vulnerable to the toxic effects of pesticide exposure. Antioxidant capacity and biochemical parameters have been used as biomarkers of occupational exposure to pesticides. The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic and renal parameters as well as butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity and ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) considering high and low exposure periods in soybean farmers in southern Brazil. The exposed group consisted of 50 soybean farmers. Two control groups were used, composed by 35 (Novo Hamburgo control group) and 28 (Sertão control group) subjects not exposed to pesticides. Farmers blood samples were collected during the high and low pesticide exposure periods. BChE, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), urea, and creatinine levels were determined. The FRAP assay was carried out to evaluate the antioxidant potential in the exposed group. Considering the exposed group, significantly lower BChE and increased AST activity were observed during high pesticide exposure period as well as higher FRAP, urea and creatinine levels; however, ALT and GGT did not differ between the two periods. When compared with the control groups, only urea and creatinine were higher in the exposed group. The present results indicate that occupational exposure to mixtures of pesticides might elicit adverse effects at the biochemical level. In addition, the study highlights the importance in considering periods of a same crop season with different degree of pesticide exposure during biologic monitoring of these biochemical parameters. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The present study compared the effect of donepezil only and combination of donepezil and gallic acid on oxidative status and cholinesterase activity in the brain of Wistar rats administered AlCl3 for 60 days. Twenty-eight rats (180 – 200 g) were arbitrarily distributed into four groups of seven animals apiece. Group 1 served as normal control and received distilled water throughout the study. Group 2 animals received only AlCl3 throughout the study while animals in groups 3 and 4 were administered donepezil only (10 mg/kg) and combination of donepezil (10 mg/kg) and gallic acid (50 mg/kg), respectively, in addition to AlCl3. Treatments were administered orally by gavage. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed and activities of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase as well as levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total thiol and nitric oxide (NO) were evaluated in the brain. Histopathological study was conducted on the hippocampus of experimental animals. Results showed that AlCl3 significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased brain activities of cholinesterases and levels of MDA and NO with a concomitant decrease in total thiol level as well as activities of SOD and catalase. Donepezil only and combination of donepezil and gallic acid reversed these alterations. Also, combination of donepezil and gallic acid significantly (p &lt; 0.05) improved antioxidant status better than donepezil only. It could be concluded that a synergy might exist between gallic acid and donepezil especially in ameliorating oxidative stress associated with AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Lead (Pb) induces neurotoxicity in both children and adults. Children are more vulnerable to Pb toxicity than adults. Little is known about the effects of Pb on the mental health of the children who are prenatally exposed. Therefore, we designed an animal experiment to compare the adverse effects of Pb on neurobehavioral and hepatic functions between Pb-exposed (Pb mice) and parental Pb-exposed (P-Pb mice) group mice. Mice were treated with Pb-acetate (10 mg/kg bodyweight/day) via drinking water. Male mice from unexposed parents treated with Pb for 90 days were defined as Pb mice, whereas male mice from Pb-exposed parents treated with Pb for further 90 days were defined as P-Pb mice. Anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory and learning were assessed by elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. Serum hepatic enzyme activities and butyrylcholinesterase activity were measured by an analyzer. P-Pb mice displayed increased anxiety-like behavior and memory and learning impairments compared to Pb mice. BChE activity was significantly decreased in P-Pb mice compared to Pb mice. Pb levels in the brains of P-Pb mice were significantly higher than those of Pb mice. The activities of serum hepatic enzymes of P-Pb mice were also higher than those of Pb mice. Additionally, histopathology data revealed that hepatic tissue injury was more pronounced in P-Pb mice than in Pb mice. Thus, the results suggest that persistent exposure to Pb from fetus to adult causes more severe neurobehavioral changes and hepatic toxicities than adult exposure only. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important drug target in neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia as well as for other conditions like myasthenia gravis and anticholinergic poisoning. In this study, we have used a combination of high-throughput screening, machine learning, and docking to identify new inhibitors of this enzyme. Bayesian machine learning models were generated with literature data from ChEMBL for eel and human AChE inhibitors as well as butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors (BuChE) and compared with other machine learning methods. High-throughput screens for the eel AChE inhibitor model identified several molecules including tilorone, an antiviral drug that is well-established outside of the United States, as a newly identified nanomolar AChE inhibitor. We have described how tilorone inhibits both eel and human AChE with IC50's of 14.4 nM and 64.4 nM, respectively, but does not inhibit the closely related BuChE IC50 > 50 μM. We have docked tilorone into the human AChE crystal structure and shown that this selectivity is likely due to the reliance on a specific interaction with a hydrophobic residue in the peripheral anionic site of AChE that is absent in BuChE. We also conducted a pharmacological safety profile (SafetyScreen44) and kinase selectivity screen (SelectScreen) that showed tilorone (1 μM) only inhibited AChE out of 44 toxicology target proteins evaluated and did not appreciably inhibit any of the 485 kinases tested. This study suggests there may be a potential role for repurposing tilorone or its derivatives in conditions that benefit from AChE inhibition. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Background: Oenanthe fistulosa L. (Apiaceae) is often associated with damp soils. Its underground parts and the young leaves are mainly cooked with other vegetables. Objective: The aim of the current work was to investigate the chemical profile of dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA) and n-butanol (BuOH) fractions of O. fistulosa through analysis of 37 phytochemicals by LC-MS/MS and to evaluate their biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-cholinesterase and antityrosinase for the first time. Methods: Analysis of 37 phytochemicals was performed by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spec-trometry (LC-MS/MS). Antioxidant activity was evaluated using five in vitro assays, while anti-cholinesterase and anti-tyrosinase activities were performed using Ellman and Dopachrome meth-ods, respectively. Results: The number of phenolic compounds detected in DCM, EA and BuOH fractions was found to be 9, 15, and 12; respectively. More specifically, 9 phenolic acids were detected and among them, chlorogenic, tr-ferulic and p-coumaric acids were the most abundant. While 8 flavonoids were detected and apigetrin, rutin, and quercitrin were the most abundant. In addition, 3 non-phenolic organ-ic acids (quinic, malic and fumaric acids) were detected in large quantities. Furthermore, the tested plant fractions demonstrated a noteworthy and strong antioxidant action. The plant displayed very strong action against Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes; and BuOH fraction was the most potent one. Finally, BuOH and DCM fractions showed good tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Conclusion: According to the obtained results, O. fistulosa might be a promising candidate for the alleviation of oxidative stress, neurodegenerative (such as Alzheimer’s disease) and hyperpigmenta-tion disorders. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background and Objective: Rapamycin and its semi-synthetic analogues (rapalogues) are frequently used in combination with other prescribed medications in clinical settings. Although the inhibitory effects of rapalogues on cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) have been well examined, the inhibition potentials of rapalogues on human esterases have not been investigated. Herein, the inhibition potentials and inhibitory mechanisms of six marketed rapalogues on human esterases are investigated. Methods: The inhibitory effects of six marketed rapalogues (rapamycin, zotarolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) on three major esterases, including human carboxylesterases 1 (hCES1A), human carboxylesterases 2 (hCES2A) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), were assayed using isozyme-specific substrates. Inhibition kinetic analyses and docking simulations were performed to investigate the inhibitory mechanisms of the rapalogues with strong hCES2A inhibition potency. Results: Zotarolimus and pimecrolimus displayed strong inhibition of human hCES2A but these agents did not inhibit hCES1A or BuChE. Further investigation demonstrated that zotarolimus could strongly inhibit intracellular hCES2A in living HepG2 cells, with an estimated IC50 value of 4.09 µM. Inhibition kinetic analyses revealed that zotarolimus inhibited hCES2A-catalyzed fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis in a mixed manner, with the Ki value of 1.61 µM. Docking simulations showed that zotarolimus could tightly bind on hCES2A at two district ligand-binding sites, consistent with its mixed inhibition mode. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that several marketed rapalogues are potent and specific hCES2A inhibitors, and these agents can serve as leading compounds for the development of more efficacious hCES2A inhibitors to modulate the pharmacokinetic profiles and toxicity of hCES2A-substrate drugs (such as the anticancer agent irinotecan).

abstract={The Amaryllidaceae family is distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical areas but also in temperate zones. In Venezuela, there are 6 genera and 13 species distributed around the country. This family is characterized by its ability to biosynthesize alkaloids with an isoquinoline type structure. In addition, a number of investigations have revealed a variety of biological activities for these alkaloids, such as antimalarial, antitumoral, analgesic, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, among others. Galanthamine, an alkaloid first obtained from Galanthus woronowii, has been used since 2001 for the palliative therapy of mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, there is great interest on searching for galanthamine sources among the wide range of Amaryllidaceae species distributed around the world. The present investigation, carried out with five species from the Amaryllidaceae family, Crinum amabile, Crinum erubescens, Crinum moorei, Amaryllis belladonna and Zephyranthes carinata, collected from different locations in Mérida State-Venezuela and analyzed by GC–MS, showed the alkaloid profile of leaves and bulbs of these species. Results revealed that lycorine and related compounds, such as 11,12-dehydro-anhydrolycorine and 1-O-acetyllycorine, were present in almost all samples analyzed, with lycorine predominant. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition capacity of these alkaloid extracts showed a strong to moderate inhibitory effect on both enzymes; C. amabile leaves being the extract with the strongest inhibitory activity against AChE at 0.88 µg/mL as well as BuChE at 4.46 µg/mL, followed by Crinum erubescens leaves with values of 1.75 µg/mL and 8.72 µg/mL, respectively, compared to the values observed for galanthamine used as control. Present investigation constitutes the first in silico report about buphanisine interactions with AChE and BuChE active sites. © 2020 SAAB},

abstract={OBJECTIVES: To assess pesticide exposure and understand the resultant health effects of agricultural workers in Northern Thailand. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. We quantified exposure to pesticides, including chlorpyrifos, methomyl, and metalaxyl, by air sampling and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. We estimated differences in self-reported health outcomes, complete blood counts, cholinesterase activity, and serum/urine calcium and creatinine concentrations at baseline between farmworkers and comparison workers, and after pesticide spraying in farmworkers only. RESULTS: This study included 97 men between the ages of 22 and 76 years; 70 were conventional farmworkers; and 27 did not report any prior farmwork or pesticide spraying. None of the farmworkers wore standardized personal protective equipment (PPE) for the concentrated chemicals they were working with. Methomyl (8.4-13 481.9 ng/m3 ), ethyl chlorpyrifos (11.6-67 759 ng/m3 ), and metalaxyl (13.9-41 191.3 ng/m3 ) were detected via personal air sampling. When it came to reporting confidence in the ability to handle personal problems, only 43% of farmworkers reported feeling confident, which reflects higher stress levels in comparison to 78% of comparison workers (P = .028). Farmworkers also had significantly lower monocyte counts (P = .01), serum calcium (P = .01), red blood count (P = .01), white blood cell count (P = .04), and butyrylcholinesterase activity (P < .0001), relative to comparison workers. After adjusting for body mass index (BMI), age, and smoking, methomyl air concentrations were associated with a decrease in farmworker acetylcholinesterase activity (beta = -0.327, P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: This population of farmworkers had significant alterations in stress measures and clinical biomarkers, including decreased blood cell counts and cholinesterase activity, relative to matched controls. These changes are potentially linked to occupational pesticide exposures. Improving PPE use presents a likely route for preventive intervention in this population. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={In this study, it was aimed to determine the in vitro antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of methanol (MeOH) extracts isolated from Onosma gracilis (Trautv.) and O. oreodoxa (Boiss. & Heldr.). O. oreodoxa was found to be richer in both phenolics and flavonoids than O. gracilis. The amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids in O. oreodoxa were 53.76 mg GAEs/g and 25.29 mg QEs/g, respectively. In addition to spectrophometric analysis, in chromatographic analyzes, twenty-four and twenty-six compounds were identified in O. gracilis and O. oreodoxa, respectively. High amounts of hesperidin (6647.2 and 5260.75 µg/g extract, respectively), hyperoside (7153.26 and 10216.74 µg/g extract, respectively) and rosmarinic acid (21824.33 and 87493.19 µg/g extract, respectively) were found in O. gracilis and O. oreodoxa. While O. oreodoxa showed higher activity in cupric reducing antioxidant power (CUPRAC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), phosphomolybdenum, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging, and ferrous ion chelating assays (324.22, 175.41, 719.50, 125.60 mg TEs/g extract and 25.11 mg EDTAEs/g extract, respectively), ABTS radical scavenging activity of O. gracilis (164.55 mg TEs/g extract) was higher than that of O. oreodoxa. O. gracilis also exhibited higher inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (2.57 mg GALAEs/g extract) and α-glucosidase (1674.24 mg ACEs/g extract). On the other hand, the sample showing the most effective inhibition on α-amylase and tyrosinase was O. oreodoxa (417.34 mg ACEs/g extract and 136.18 mg KAEs/g extract, respectively). As a result of the molecular docking analysis performed to determine the contribution of hesperidin, hyperoside and rosmarinic acid to the enzyme inhibitory activity, the binding affinity and inhibition constant of hyperoside to all enzymes were quite high and therefore it was concluded that it may be the compound that contribute to the activity. © 2021 SAAB},

abstract={All cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory drugs in clinical use are nitrogenous compounds and among them, galanthamine as the latest anticholinesterase drug, contains a tetrahydroisoquinoline structure. For this reason, isoquinoline alkaloids seem to be attractive in search for novel drug candidates towards Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, in the current work, we investigated inhibitory capacity of several alkaloids representing expanding group of biogenetically-related isoquinoline alkaloids from the Amaryllidaceae including lycorine, (+)-9-O-demethylhomolycorine, 6-hydroxybuphanisine, 9-O-demethoxymontanine, 3-epi-hydroxy-bulbispermine, tazettine, haemanthamine, (+)-haemanthidine, (-)-crinine, 8-hydroxy-9-methoxycrinine, and N-norgalanthamine against ChEs by microtiter enzyme inhibition assays. Our findings indicated that N-norgalanthamine is the most active one inhibiting both acetylcholinesterase (AChE, IC50 = 2.42 ± 0.16 µg/mL) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, IC50 = 20.87 ± 1.01 µg/mL) at 100 μg/mL, whereas IC50 values of galanthamine used as the reference were 1.33 ± 0.11 µg/mL and 37.69 ± 2.93 µg/mL for AChE and BChE, respectively. Beside this, 8-hydroxy-9-methoxycrinine was a strong inhibitor of AChE (IC50 = 6.92 ± 0.51 µg/mL), while (+)-9-O-demethylhomolycorine displayed a moderate BChE inhibition (IC50 = 83.57 ± 1.36 µg/mL). Relevantly, 8-hydroxy-9-methoxycrinine and N-norgalanthamine were docked into active gorges of hAChE (PDB: 4EY6) and hBChE (PDB: 4TPK), which pointed out the detail that N-norgalanthamine displayed a very similar binding mode of to that of galanthamine. Moreover, both AChE-inhibiting alkaloids were found to stably bind to hAChE active site occupying the middle of the gorge between the catalytic site and the peripheral anionic site. 8-Hydroxy-9-methoxycrinine was also docked into the active site of BChE. We can conclude that among the tested alkaloids, N-norgalanthamine with dual ChE inhibitory effect seems to be the most promising anti-Alzheimer candidate molecule for future experiments. © 2020 SAAB},

abstract={Abstract: Synthesizing new chemical compounds and studying their biological applications have been important issues in scientific research. In this investigation, we synthesized and characterized ten new N-acetyl phosphoramidate compounds and explored the crystal structure of three others. Furthermore, not only were some kinetic inhibition parameters measured, like IC50, Ki, kp, KD for 7 compounds on human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), but also their hydrophobic parameter was determined by shake-flask technique. All compounds (number 1–10) were investigated for anti-bacterial activity against three Gram-positive and three Gram-negative bacteria, while chloramphenicol was used as a standard antibiotic. In order to find new insecticide, toxicities of 13 acephate (Ace)-derived compounds (number 20–32) were bioassayed on third larval instar of elm leaf beetle and Xanthogaleruca luteola. Additionally, screening in vivo tests revealed that two compounds had had the greatest insecticidal potential in comparison with others. It means these ones inhibited AChE (with mixed mechanisms) and general esterase more than the rest. According to ChE-QSAR models, the inhibitory potency for enzyme and bacteria is directly influenced by the electronic parameters versus structural descriptors. AChE-QSPR model of fluorescence assay indicated that the inhibitory power of AChE is primarily influenced by a set of electronic factors with the priority of: EHB &gt; PL &gt; δ(31P) versus structural descriptor (SA and Mv).

abstract={Abstract: During the present investigation, two new sulfonamide-based Schiff base ligands, 4-{[(2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methylidene]amino}-N-(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)benzene-1-sulfonamide (L1) and 4-{[1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethylidene]amino}-N-(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)benzene-1-sulfonamide (L2), have been synthesized and coordinated with the transition metals (V, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). The ligands were characterized by their physical (color, melting point, yield and solubility), spectral (UV–Vis, FT-IR, LC–MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR) and elemental data. The structures of the metal complexes (1)–(12) were evaluated through their physical (magnetic and conductance), spectral (UV–Vis, FT-IR and LC–MS) and elemental data. The molecular geometries of ligands and their selected metal complexes were optimized at their ground state energies by B3LYP level of density functional theory (DFT) utilizing 6-311+G (d, p) and LanL2DZ basis set. The first principle study has been discussed for the electronic properties, the molecular electrostatic possibilities as well as the quantum chemical identifiers. An obvious transition of intramolecular charge had been ascertained from the occupied to the unoccupied molecular orbitals. The UV–Vis analysis was performed through time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) by CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G (d, p) function. The in vitro antimicrobial activity was studied against two fungal (Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus) and four bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) species. The antioxidant activity was executed as antiradical DPPH scavenging activity (%), total iron reducing power (%) and total phenolic contents (mg GAE g−1). Additionally, enzyme inhibition activity was done against four enzymes (Protease, α-Amylase, Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase). All the synthetic products exhibited significant bioactivity which were found to enhance upon chelation due to phenomenon of charge transfer from metal to ligand.

abstract={Objective: To synthesize a series of ring-substituted chrysotoxine (CTX) derivatives and evaluate their cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Methods: CTX was totally synthesized by a 7-step reaction, in which syringaldehyde was used as the raw material and the Wittig reaction was taken as the key step. Based on the lead compound CTX, 10 novel ring-substituted CTX derivatives were synthesized and their inhibitory activities against cholinesterase were investigated by Ellman method. Besides, the ligand-protein interaction mode between acetylcholinesterase and one of CTX derivatives with the best inhibition activities was simulated by molecular docking software AutoDock vina. Results: Ten ring-substituted CTX derivatives were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and ESI-MS. The activity assay showed that all of the CTX derivatives possessed mild-to-moderate inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Among them, CTX-2 had the strongest selectivity, of which the IC50 for acetylcholinesterase was (11.05±1.12) μmol•L-1 and the selectivity index (SI) was 7.26. Molecular docking result showed that CTX-2 binded to the acetylcholinesterase hydrophobic pocket in the "N-type" conformation and the bond energy was -10.2 kcal•mol-1. Conclusion: CTX-2 has good cholinesterase inhibitory activity, which suggested CTX-2 has the potential to be developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. © 2020, Chinese Journal of New Drugs Co.

The chemical composition mostly consisted of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids (>70%), the main ones being (E)-β-caryophyllene (17.8%), α-copaene (10.5%), β-bourbonene (9.9%), δ-cadinene (6.6%), cis-cadina-1(6),4-diene (6.4%) and germacrene D (4.9%), with the non-polar column. The essential oil was then submitted to enantioselective GC analysis, with a diethyl-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin diluted in PS-086 chiral selector, resulting in the following enantiomeric excesses for the chiral components: (1R,5S)-(-)-α-thujene (67.8%), (1R,5R)-(+)-α-pinene (85.5%), (1S,5S)-(-)-β-pinene (90.0%), (1S,5S)-(-)-sabinene (12.3%), (S)-(-)-limonene (88.1%), (S)-(+)-linalool (32.7%), (R)-(-)-terpinen-4-ol (9.3%), (S)-(-)-α-terpineol (71.2%) and (S)-(-)-germacrene D (89.0%). The inhibition activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) of C. taxifolium essential oil was then tested, resulting in selective activity against BChE with an IC50 value of 31.3 ± 3.0 μg/mL (positive control: donepezil, IC50 = 3.6 μg/mL).},

abstract={Salmeterol and albuterol are well-known β2-adenoreceptor agonists widely used in the treatment of inflammatory respiratory diseases, such as bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Here we report the preparation of structural isomers of salmeterol and albuterol, which can be obtained from the same starting material as the corresponding β2-agonists, depending on the synthetic approach employed. Using 1D and various 2D NMR measurements, we determined that the structure of prepared isomers holds the β-aryl-β-aminoethanol moiety, in contrast to the α-aryl-β-aminoethanol moiety found in salmeterol and albuterol. We investigated the reaction of β-halohydrin and amines responsible for the formation of β-aryl-β-amino alcohol-both experimentally and using computational methods. The structure of β-halohydrin with the methyl salicylate moiety imposes the course of the reaction. The solvent plays a relevant, yet ambiguous role in the direction of the reaction, while the strength of the base influences the reaction yield and isomer ratio in a more evident way. Using computational methods, we have shown that the most probable reaction intermediate responsible for the formation of the unexpected isomer is the corresponding para-quinone methide, which can be formed due to phenol present in the methyl salicylate moiety. After successful preparation of albuterol and salmeterol isomers, we tested their inhibition potency to human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and usual and atypical butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Kinetic studies revealed that both isomers are low-potency reversible inhibitors of human cholinesterases. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Effects of biosensor modified materials, electrolyte solution, enzyme activity and inhibition time on response current of enzyme biosensor were investigated. The optimum analytical parameters for determination of Malachite Green were determined as follows:the ratio of CS to GS was 1:2, the electrolyte solution was 0.1 mol/L PBS, the pH was 7, the inhibition time was 11 min, and the enzyme activity was 4.0 U/mL. Under optimum conditions, the response currents of the enzyme biosensor had a good linear relationship with MG concentration with a detection range from 1.00×10-7 mol/L to 1.10×10-6 mol/L. The linear equation was Ip=-6.97CMG+22.805 (R2=0.9885), with the limit of detection (LOD) as 2.80×10-8 mol/L (S/N=3). The addition standard recovery of the developed method was 96.36% to 99.78%. The developed method is simple, rapid and sensitive with good selectivity and excellent repeatability, which is practicable for rapid determination of MG or LMG in sea foods. © 2020, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the mainstay of Alzheimer's disease treatments, despite having only short-term symptomatic benefits and severe side effects. Selective butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors (BuChEIs) may be more effective treatments in late-stage Alzheimer's disease with fewer side effects. Virtual screening is a powerful tool for identifying potential inhibitors in large digital compound databases. This study used structure-based virtual screening combined with physicochemical filtering to screen the InterBioScreen and Maybridge databases for novel selective BuChEIs. The workflow rapidly identified 22 potential hits in silico, resulting in the discovery of a human BuChEI with low-micromolar potency in vitro (IC50 2.4 µM) and high selectivity for butyrylcholinesterase over acetylcholinesterase. The compound was a rapidly reversible BuChEI with mixed-model in vitro inhibition kinetics. The binding interactions were investigated using in silico molecular dynamics and by developing structure-activity relationships using nine analogues. The compound also displayed high permeability in an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Polysaccharides are essential compounds that contribute to the biological activities of mushrooms. Two new galactomannans (Galactomannan I and II) were isolated from R. luteolus and G. adspersum. Their structures were characterized using FT-IR, 1D, and 2D-NMR techniques. Both isolated galactomannans I and II mainly include D-mannose and D-galactose in the molar percentages of 0.81:1.0 and 1:1.4, respectively. The GPC calculation demonstrated that the molecular weights are about 5240 and 5090 Da, respectively. Their structures comprise of β-(1,4)-mannose (Man) backbone units with α-(1,6)-galactose (Gal) single unit as a side group. The anticholinesterase activity of galactomannans was tested against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), spectrophotometrically. Antioxidant activity was also measured by six assays (ABTS•+, DPPH•, O2•−, β-carotene-linoleic acid, metal chelating, and CUPRAC assays). Galactomannan II indicated close inhibitory activity to galantamine against AChE (61.04 ± 0.45%) and BChE (59.70 ± 1.15%) at 50 μg/mL concentration. Nevertheless, both galactomannans showed low antioxidant activity in all tests. This study reveals that mainly, Galactomannan II could be used as a new natural promising anticholinesterase agent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Stephaniae tetrandrae radix (STR) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine in alleviating edema by inducing diuresis. In the clinic, STR extracts or its components are widely used in the treatment of edema, dysuria, and rheumatism for the regulation of water metabolism. Furthermore, STR has been used in treating emotional problems for years by combining with other Chinese herbs. However, the material basis and mechanism of STR on the nervous system have not been revealed. Here, the main components of STR extracts with different extracting solvents were identified, including three major alkaloids, i.e., cyclanoline, fangchinoline, and tetrandrine. The cholinesterase inhibitory activity of STR extracts and its alkaloids was determined using the Ellman assay. Both cyclanoline and fangchinoline showed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, demonstrating noncompetitive enzyme inhibition. In contrast, tetrandrine did not show enzymatic inhibition. The synergism of STR alkaloids with huperzine A or donepezil was calculated by the median-effect principle. The drug combination of fangchinoline-huperzine A or donepezil synergistically inhibited AChE, having a combination index (CI) < 1 at Fa = 0.5. Furthermore, the molecular docking results showed that fangchinoline bound with AChE residues in the peripheral anionic site, and cyclanoline bound with AChE residues in the peripheral anionic site, anionic site, and catalytic site. In parallel, cyclanoline bound with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) residues in the anionic site, catalytic site, and aromatic site. The results support that fangchinoline and cyclanoline, alkaloids derived from STR, could account for the anti-AChE function of STR. Thus, STR extract or its alkaloids may potentially be developed as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's patients.},

All compounds were potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with selectivity toward BChE. Lead compound 8c, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-{[2-(7,8,9,10- tetrahydro-6H-cyclohepta[b]quinolin-11-ylamino)-ethylimino]-methyl}-phenol exhibited an IC50(AChE) = 1.90 ± 0.16 µM, IC50(BChE) = 0.084 ± 0.008 µM, and 13.6 ± 1.2% propidium displacement at 20 μM. Compounds possessed low activity against carboxylesterase, indicating likely absence of clinically unwanted drug-drug interactions. Kinetics were consistent with mixed-type reversible inhibition of both cholinesterases. Docking indicated binding to catalytic and peripheral AChE sites; peripheral site binding along with propidium displacement suggest the potential of the hybrids to block AChE-induced β-amyloid aggregation, a disease-modifying effect. Compounds demonstrated high antioxidant activity in ABTS and FRAP assays as well as inhibition of luminol chemiluminescence and lipid peroxidation in mouse brain homogenates. Conjugates 8 with amine-containing spacers were better antioxidants than those with enamine spacers 7. Computational ADMET profiles for all compounds predicted good blood-brain barrier distribution (permeability), good intestinal absorption, and medium cardiac toxicity risk. Overall, based on their favorable pharmacological and ADMET profiles, conjugates 8 appear promising as candidates for AD therapeutics.},

abstract={Previous studies have reported that Hedyotis diffusa Willdenow extract shows various biological activities on cerebropathia, such as neuroprotection and short-term memory enhancement. However, there has been a lack of studies on the inhibitory activity on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) through enzyme assays of H. diffusa. Therefore, H. diffusa extract and fractions were evaluated for their inhibitory effects through assays of enzymes related to AD, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and on the formation of advanced glycation end-product (AGE). In this study, ten bioactive compounds, including nine iridoid glycosides 1-9 and one flavonol glycoside 10, were isolated from the ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of H. diffusa using a bioassay-guided approach. Compound 10 was the strongest inhibitor of cholinesterase, BACE1, and the formation of AGEs of all isolated compounds, while compound 5 had the lowest inhibitory activity. Compounds 3, 6, and 9 exhibited better inhibitory activity than other compounds on AChE, and two pairs of diastereomeric iridoid glycoside structures (compounds 4, 8, and 6, 7) showed higher inhibitory activity than others on BChE. In the BACE1 inhibitory assay, compounds 1-3 were good inhibitors, and compound 10 showed higher inhibitory activity than quercetin, the positive control. Moreover, compounds 1 and 3 were stronger inhibitors of the formation of AGE than aminoguanidine (AMG), the positive control. In conclusion, this study is significant since it demonstrated that the potential inhibitory activity of H. diffusa on enzymes related to AD and showed the potential use for further study as a natural medicine for AD treatment on the basis of the bioactive components isolated from H. diffusa.},

abstract={Salvia officinalis L. (sage) is one of the most appreciated plants for its plethora of biologically active compounds. The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1-S3) of Southern Italy. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellman's method. Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects. Camphor (16.16-18.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.80-9.86%), β-pinene (3.08-9.14%), camphene (6.27-8.08%), and α-thujone (1.17-9.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents. However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC50 value of 20.64 μg/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC50 values of 38.06 and 46.32 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively.

abstract={Cholinesterases (ChE) are well-known drug targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Among the identified hits, two compounds (denoted 3 and 18) were found to be the most potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE, IC50 = 6.10 ± 1.01 μM) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE, IC50 = 5.50 ± 0.007 μM), respectively. Compound 3 was responsible for the formation of H-bond and π-πstacking interactions within the active site of AChE. In contrast, compound 18 was well fitted in the choline-binding pocket and catalytic site of BuChE. Results obtained from in vitro cytotoxicity assays and in silico derived physicochemical and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties indicate that repurposed scaffold 3 and 18 could be potential drug candidates for further development as novel ChE inhibitors. ©},

abstract={Ethnobotanical and ethnomedicinal relevance: In southern Ecuador, horchata lojana is a popular aromatic and refreshing beverage that is prepared from an aqueous infusion of different mixtures of local medicinal and aromatic plants. The drink is considered a traditional anti-inflammatory agent and brain tonic; due these properties, it has been drunk since Colonial Times. Several pharmacological studies have evaluated the effects of horchata aqueous infusion. However, the aromatic profile and the contribution of the volatile components to the biological activity of the drink have not been investigated so far. For these reasons, we have determined the chemical composition of the essential oils (EOs) distilled from five mixtures of aromatic plants commonly used for the preparation of this traditional drink. Moreover, to support the curative properties of the aromatic plants, the anticholinesterase activity of the EOs was examined. Material and methods: Different bunches of fresh mixed medicinal and aromatic plants, called tongos, are sold at local markets in the province of Loja for the preparation of different types of horchata. In this research we have purchased plant bunches sold at five popular markets of Loja province. Subsequently, aromatic plants in each bunch were separated from medicinal plants and were then hydrodistilled to give the corresponding EOs. Subsequently, the chemical composition of each EO was determined by GC-MS/GC–FID techniques, whereas the cholinesterase inhibitory activity in vitro was determined against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymes. Aims of the study: i) to contribute to the chemical and pharmacological study of the aroma components of the traditional Ecuadorian drink horchata lojana; ii) to identify botanically the mixtures of aromatic plants used to make the drink; iii) to establish, on the basis of the chemical composition of the EOs, the compounds mainly responsible for the characteristic beverage flavor; iv) to establish the possible existence of an aromatic pattern characteristic of each horchata preparation; v) to test the anticholinesterase activity of the EOs against AChE and BuChE in order to support the traditional consume of the drink as an effective brain tonic. Results: A total of 23 botanical families and 32 species of plants used for the preparation of five different variants of the traditional horchata lojana beverage, have been identified. Fourteen aromatic species were determined to be responsible for the characteristic flavor of the drink. All the analyzed EOs belong to the monoterpene type. A total of 88 compounds have been identified in the different EOs, twenty-four of which are common components of the oils. Conclusions: According to the main components of the EOs distilled from the five groups of horchata lojana plants, four aromatic profiles have been defined: (i) neral + geranial + carvone, (ii) neral + geranial + myrcene; (iii) geranial + methyl eugenol + isomenthone + neral + citronellol; (iv) (E)-anethole + geranial + pulegone. Moreover, according to the literature, several aromatic plants and individual EOs components exhibit a wide range of biological activities. This finding as well as the significant BuChE inhibitory activity exhibited in vitro by the EOs give scientific support to the use of identified aromatic plants in the traditional preparation of horchata, that is considered a natural analgesic and anti-inflammatory remedy, and an effective brain tonic. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Artemisia copa Phil. (Asteraceae) (known as copa-copa) is a native species of Chile used as an infusion in traditional medicine by Atacameños people in the Altiplano, highlands of northern Chile. In this research, we have investigated for the first time the cholinesterase inhibition potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and the chemical profiling of the infusions prepared from the aerial parts of A. copa by high resolution spectrometry. In addition, total phenolic, total flavonoid content, antioxidant (DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC) and antiprozoal activity were tested. Artemisia copa showed good inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE (3.92 ± 0.08 µg/ml and 44.13 ± 0.10 µg/ml). The infusion displayed a total phenolics content of 155.6 ± 2.9 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g and total flavonoid content of 5.5 ± 0.2 mg quercetin equivalents/g. Additionally, trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi was found (LD50 of 131.8 µg/ml). Forty-seven metabolites were detected in the infusion of A. copa including several phenolic acids and flavonoids which were rapidly identified using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis (UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS) for chemical profiling. The major compounds identified in the infusions were studied by molecular docking against AChE and BChE. The UHPLC-MS fingerprints generated can be also used for the authentication of these endemic species. These findings reveal that A. copa infusions can be used as beverages with protective effects. © Copyright © 2020 Larrazábal-Fuentes, Fernández-Galleguillos, Palma-Ramírez, Romero-Parra, Sepúlveda, Galetovic, González, Paredes, Bórquez, Simirgiotis and Echeverría.},

abstract={Chalcones are considered effective templates for the development of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors. The present work describes the syntheses of selected 1,3-benzodioxine-containing chalcones (CD3, CD8 and CD10), and their inhibitory activities against MAO-A, MAO-B, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Compound CD8 most potently inhibited MAO-B with an IC50 value of 0.026 μM, followed by CD10 and CD3 (1.54 and 1.68 μM, respectively). CD8 potently and non-selectively inhibited MAO-A (IC50 value of 0.023 μM). On the other hand, CD10 and CD8 inhibited AChE with IC50 values of 5.40 and 9.57 μM, respectively. Kinetics and reversibility experiments showed that all synthesized molecules were competitive and reversible inhibitors, and the Ki values of CD8 for MAO-A and MAO-B were 0.018 and 0.0019 μM, respectively. By in vitro and in silico analyses, all compounds were found to have high passive human gastrointestinal absorptions, blood-brain barrier permeabilities, and non-toxicities. Molecular docking simulations revealed that docking affinity of each compound for MAO-B was higher than that for MAO-A. The results indicate that CD8 is a potent non-selective MAO inhibitor, and CD10 is an effective selective MAO-B inhibitor, and both possess AChE inhibitory activity. Therefore, we suggest that CD8 and CD10 be considered potential dual-targeting inhibitors of MAO and AChE for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={The cholinesterase enzymes play a vital role in maintaining balanced levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central nervous system. However, the overexpression of these enzymes results in hampered neurotransmission. Both the major forms of cholinesterase enzymes viz. acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) play a crucial role in blocking neurotransmission; therefore, in recent years, a strategy of dual cholinesterase inhibition is being explored. Herein, we developed an energy-optimized e-pharmacophore hypothesis AHHPRR from AChE-donepezil complex and screened a set of 15 scaffolds that were designed imaginarily. The ligand with N-(1-benzylpyridinium) benzamide framework has shown the highest fitness and volume score, which was chosen for synthesis and validation. A series of pyridinium benzamides were synthesized and screened for cholinesterase inhibition that led to the identification of 7b, a naphthalene containing N-(1-benzylpiperidine) benzamide as a potent dual AChE and BChE inhibitor with IC50 values of 0.176, and 0.47 μM, respectively. The kinetic study indicated that 7b inhibits AChE in a non-competitive manner with Ki value of 0.21 μM, and BChE in a mixed-fashion with Ki of 0.15 μM. The observed mode of inhibition was corroborated with molecular docking studies. The MD simulation studies pointed out that both AChE and BChE undergo low conformational changes in complex with 7b. The benzamide 7b displayed high BBB permeability in PAMPA assay, which indicates its potential for further exploration in preclinical studies for Alzheimer's disease. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Introduction: Biomarkers which can predict disease progression and serve as prognostic indicators are necessary for better management of oral cancer. Studies have shown that Cholinesterase plays an important role in cellular proliferation, differentiation and may have a possible involvement in tumor growth. Aim and Objective: The present study is aimed to determine the utility of serum Butyrylcholinesterase (BChe) levels as a marker for progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in relation to the grade of the tumor and to determine if any variation occurred in the levels of BChe before and after therapy. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 patients were included in the study and divided into two groups as Group A-30 patients (healthy individuals) and Group B-90 cases of histopathologically diagnosed OSCC. The blood sample was collected before surgery, re-collected after the completion of radiotherapy (i.e., 3 and 6 months postsurgery) and analyzed biochemically for the concentration of BCh. Statistical Analysis: Paired t-test, ANOVA, and post hoc test (Bonferroni) were used for determining the statistical significance. Results: BChe levels were lower in OSCC (2940.32-1405.50 u/l when compared with controls (11149.60-11243.07 unit/l) and this difference was statistically significant. Postoperatively at 3 months, the serum BChe levels of OSCC patients increased almost two-fold compared to the preoperative values, and this difference was also statistically significant (P = 0.000) After 6 months, these levels further increased but did not reach those of controls. Conclusion: BChe can be used as an inexpensive, easy to use, noninvasive biomarker for the evaluation of disease-free survival in OSCC patients. © 2020 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a serine hydrolase present in plasma and other mammalian tissues. As a target of organophosphorous pesticides and warfare nerve agents, BChE acts as their stoichiometric bioscavenger. However, so far it has been a significant challenge to produce BChE at large scales and low cost. For decades, numerous research efforts have been directed first at isolation from human volunteers and later at production of BChE in eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems. In this review we focused on recent studies on recombinant BChE discussing reasons why the efficient, economically sensible expression system for recombinant BChE is hard to develop. We also bring the most recent advancements in the use of expression of human BChE in vivo as an effective prophylactic against organophosphate poisoning. © 2020, Croatian Society of Natural Sciences.

abstract={In this study, a series of new flavones (2-phenyl-chromone), 2-naphthyl chromone, 2-anthryl-chromone, or 2-biphenyl-chromone derivatives containing 6 or 7-substituted tertiary amine side chain were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition. The results indicated that the alteration of aromatic ring connecting to chromone scaffold brings about a significant impact on biological activity. Compared with flavones, the inhibitory activity of 2-naphthyl chromone, 2-anthryl-chromone derivatives against AChE significantly decreased, while that of 2-biphenyl chromone derivatives with 7-substituted tertiary amine side chain is better than relative flavones derivatives. For all new synthesized compounds, the position of tertiary amine side chain obviously influenced the activity of inhibiting AChE. The results above provide great worthy information for the further development of new AChE inhibitors. Among the newly synthesized compounds, compound 5a is potent in AChE inhibition (IC50 = 1.29 ± 0.10 μmol/L) with high selectivity for AChE over BChE (selectivity ratio: 27.96).

abstract={Background: Acetylcholine deficiencies in hippocampus and cortex, aggregation of β-amyloid, and β-secretase over activity have been introduced as main reasons in pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Methods: Colorimetric Ellman’s method was used for determination of IC50 value in AChE and BChE inhibitory activity. The kinetic studies, neuroprotective and β-secretase inhibitory activities, evaluation of inhibitory potency on β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregations induced by AChE, and docking study were performed for prediction of the mechanism of action. Result and discussion: A new series of cinnamic acids-tryptamine hybrid was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as dual cholinesterase inhibitors. These compounds demonstrated in-vitro inhibitory activities against acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BChE). Among of these synthesized compounds, (E)-N-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acrylamide (5q) demonstrated the most potent AChE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 11.51 μM) and (E)-N-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)acrylamide (5b) were the best anti-BChE (IC50 = 1.95 μM) compounds. In addition, the molecular modeling and kinetic studies depicted 5q and 5b were mixed type inhibitor and bound with both the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic sites (CAS) of AChE and BChE. Moreover, compound 5q showed mild neuroprotective in PC12 cell line and weak β-secretase inhibitory activities. This compound also inhibited aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in self-induced peptide aggregation test at concentration of 10 μM. Conclusion: It is worth noting that both the kinetic study and the molecular modeling of 5q and 5b depicted that these compounds simultaneously interacted with both the catalytic active site and the peripheral anionic site of AChE and BChE. These findings match with those resulted data from the enzyme inhibition assay. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Cholinesterase (ChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors have been attracted as candidate treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fifteen khellactone-type coumarins from the roots of Peucedanum japonicum Thunberg were tested for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and MAO inhibitory activities. Compound 3′-angeloyl-4′-(2-methylbutyryl)khellactone (PJ13) most potently inhibited AChE (IC50 = 9.28 µM), followed by 3′-isovaleryl-4′-(2-methylbutyroyl)khellactone (PJ15) (IC50 = 10.0 μM). Compound senecioyl-4′-angeloyl-khellactone (PJ5) most potently inhibited BChE (IC50 = 7.22 μM) and had the highest selectivity index (&gt; 5.54), followed by 3′-senecioyl-4′-(2-methylbutyryl)khellactone (PJ10) and 3′,4′-disenecioylkhellactone (PJ4) (IC50 = 10.2 and 10.7 μM, respectively). Compounds PJ13, PJ15, and PJ5 showed reversible and mixed-types of inhibition with Ki values of 5.98, 10.4 (for AChE), and 4.16 µM (for BChE), respectively. However, all 15 compounds weakly inhibited MAO-A and MAO-B. Molecular docking simulation revealed that PJ13 had a higher binding affinity (− 9.3 kcal/mol) with AChE than PJ15 (− 7.8 kcal/mol) or PJ5 (− 5.4 kcal/mol), due to the formation of a hydrogen bond with Tyr121 (distance: 2.52 Å). On the other hand, the binding affinity of PJ5 (− 10.0 kcal/mol) with BChE was higher than for PJ13 (− 7.7 kcal/mol) or PJ15 (− 8.1 kcal/mol), due to the formation of a hydrogen bond with Ser198 (distance: 2.05 Å). These results suggest that PJ13 and PJ5 are potential reversible selective inhibitors of AChE and BChE, respectively, for the treatment of AD. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Existing genetic information can be leveraged to identify patients with susceptibilities to conditions that might impact their perioperative care, but clinicians generally have limited exposure and are not trained to contextualise this information. We identified patients with genetic susceptibilities to anaesthetic complications using a perioperative biorepository and characterised the concordance with existing diagnoses. Methods: Adult patients undergoing surgery within Michigan Medicine from 2012 to 2017 were consented for genotyping. Genotypes were integrated with the electronic health record (EHR). We retrospectively characterised frequencies of variants associated with butyrylcholinesterase deficiency, factor V Leiden, and malignant hyperthermia, three pharmacogenetic factors with perioperative implications. We calculated the percentage homozygous and heterozygous for each that had been diagnosed previously and searched for EHR findings consistent with a predisposition. Results: Analysis of genetic data revealed that 25 out of 40 769 (0.1%) patients were homozygous and 1918 (4.7%) were heterozygous for mutations associated with butyrylcholinesterase deficiency. Of the homozygous individuals, 14 (56%) carried a pre-existing diagnosis. For factor V Leiden, 29 (0.1%) were homozygous and 2153 (5.3%) heterozygous. Of the homozygous individuals, three (10%) were diagnosed by EHR-derived phenotype and six (21%) by clinician review. Malignant hyperthermia was assessed in a subset of patients. We detected two patients with associated mutations. Neither carried clinical diagnoses. Conclusions: We identified patients with genetic susceptibility to perioperative complications using an open source script designed for clinician use. We validated this application in a retrospective analysis for three conditions with well-characterised inheritance, and showed that not all genetic susceptibilities were documented in the EHR. © 2020 British Journal of Anaesthesia},

abstract={Canine babesiosis is a common tick-borne disease affecting canidae of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This study investigated the activity of cholinergic system enzymes and hepatic biofunction in dogs naturally infected with Babesia gibsoni. An infected group comprised 10 male dogs (stray and shepherd), and 10 healthy dogs as control were included in the study. Hematological parameters and activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were measured. The biomarkers of hepatic function including the activities of various enzymes, total bilirubin levels, and albumin contents were also assessed. The infected animals revealed a significant decrease in RBC count, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, albumin content, and BchE activity compared with the control animals. However, the activities of AChE and hepatic enzymes as well as bilirubin levels were significantly higher in the diseased animals. Our results indicate that B. gibsoni infection can change the activities of AChE and BChE and damage liver. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of the cholinergic system in the pathogenesis of canine babesiosis. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by cognitive deficit and memory loss. The pathological feature of the disease involves β-amyloid senile plaques, reduced levels of acetylcholine neurotransmitter, oxidative stress and neurofibrillary tangles formation within the brain of AD patients. The present study aims to screen the inhibitory activity of newly synthesized and existing novel 4-methylthiocoumarin derivative against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, BACE1, β-amyloid aggregation and oxidative stress involved in the AD pathogenesis. The in vitro assays used in this study were Ellman’s assay, FRET assays, Thioflavin T, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism, FRAP, and TEAC. Molecular docking and dynamics studies were performed to correlate the results. C3 and C7 (thiocoumarin derivatives) were found to be the most potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (IC50-5.63 µM) and butyrylcholinesterase (IC50-3.40 µM) using Ellman’s assays. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that C3 and C7 compounds followed by the mixed mode of inhibition using LB plot. C3 also moderately inhibited the BACE1 using FRET assay. C3 inhibited the fibrillization of β-amyloid peptides in a concentration-dependent manner as observed by Thioflavin T, TEM studies and Circular dichroism data. Molecular modeling studies were performed to understand the probable mode of binding of C3 and C7 in the binding pocket of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, BACE1 and amyloid β peptides. This indicates the important role of hydrophobic interactions between C3 and acetylcholinesterase. C3 also exhibited significant antioxidant potential by FRAP and TEAC assays. Hence, C3 might serve as a promising lead for developing novel multi target-directed ligand for the treatment of AD. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

abstract={To discover multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a new series of 1,2,3-triazole-chromenone derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the multi target-directed ligands approach. The in vitro biological activities included acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition as well as anti-Aβ aggregation, neuroprotective effects, and metal-chelating properties. The results indicated a highly selective BuChE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 21.71 μM for compound 10h as the most potent compound. Besides, compound 10h could inhibit self-induced Aβ1–42 aggregation and AChE-induced Aβ aggregation with 32.6% and 29.4% inhibition values, respectively. The Lineweaver–Burk plot and molecular modeling study showed that compound 10h targeted both the catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of BuChE. It should be noted that compound 10h was able to chelate biometals. Thus, the designed scaffold could be considered as multifunctional agents in AD drug discovery developments.

abstract={Oxytocin is associated with reproductive physiology but also with welfare and positive emotions. In this study, oxytocin was measured in saliva samples of 45 pigs that were collected before being transported to the slaughterhouse, at the time of arrival and 4 h after arrival to the slaughterhouse. Two previously validated assays, one that measures free oxytocin and other that measures oxytocin linked to proteins, were used. In addition, cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), total esterase activity (TEA), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which are biomarkers associated with stress and pain in pigs, were measured. The results showed a decrease in free and protein-linked oxytocin concentrations at 4 h after transport compared with the time before transport, while cortisol, sAA, TEA, BChE and LDH showed an increase at 4 h after transport compared with the time before transport. Based on these results it can be concluded that the transport and lairage at slaughterhouse in the conditions of this study produce a decrease in oxytocin in the saliva of pigs that could indicate a reduced emotional well-being. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Neurodegenerative diseases have complex etiology and pose a challenge to scientists to develop simple and cost-effective synthetic compounds as potential drug candidates for such diseases. Here, we report an extension of our previously published in silico screening, where we selected four new compounds as AChE inhibitors. Further, based on favorable binding possess, MD simulation and MMGBSA, two most promising compounds (3a and 3b) were selected, keeping in view the ease of synthesis and cost-effectiveness. Due to the critical role of BChE, LOX and α-glucosidase in neurodegeneration, the selected compounds were also screened against these enzymes. The IC50 values of 3a against AChE and BChE found to be 12.53 and 352.42 μM, respectively. Moderate to slight inhibitions of 45.26 % and 28.68 % were presented by 3a against LOX and α-glucosidase, respectively, at 0.5 mM. Insignificant inhibitions were observed with 3b against the four selected enzymes. Further, in vivo trial demonstrated that 3a could significantly diminish AChE levels in the mice brain as compared to the control. These findings were in agreement with the histopathological analysis of the brain tissues. The results corroborate that selected compounds could serve as a potential lead for further development and optimization as AChE inhibitors to achieve cost-effective anti-Alzheimer's drugs. © 2020},

abstract={Objectives: This study was aimed at investigating neuroprotective effect of catechol on redox imbalance, cholinergic dysfunctions, nucleotide hydrolysing enzymes activities, and dysregulated metabolic pathways in iron-mediated oxidative brain injury. Methods: Oxidative injury was induced in brain tissues by incubating with 0.1 mm FeSO4 and treated with different concentrations of catechol. Key findings: Catechol significantly elevated glutathione level, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, while depleting malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. It also inhibited the activities of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and ATPase, with concomitant elevation of ENTPDase activity. GC-MS analysis revealed that treatment with catechol completely depleted oxidative-generated lipid metabolites. While LC-MS analysis revealed depletion of oxidative-generated metabolites in brain tissues treated with catechol, with concomitant restoration of oxidative-depleted metabolites. Catechol also led to reactivation of oxidative-inactivated taurine and hypotaurine, purine, glutathione, glycerophospholipid, nicotinate and nicotinamide, fructose and mannose, pyrimidine metabolisms and pentose phosphate pathways. Catechol was predicted in silico to be permeable across the blood–brain barrier with a predicted oral LD50 value of 100 mg/kg and a toxicity class of 3. Conclusion: These results suggest the neuroprotective effects of catechol in iron-mediated oxidative brain injury. © 2020 Royal Pharmaceutical Society},

abstract={HIV infection affects up to 30% of children presenting with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa and is associated with increased mortality. Children with SAM are treated similarly regardless of HIV status, although mechanisms of nutritional recovery in HIV and/or SAM are not well understood. We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and plasma proteomics data among children with complicated SAM in Kenya and Malawi. Compared to children with SAM without HIV (n = 113), HIV-infected children (n = 54) had evidence (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p < 0.05) of metabolic stress, including enriched pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we observed reduced plasma levels of zinc-α-2-glycoprotein, butyrylcholinesterase, and increased levels of complement C2 resembling findings in metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. HIV was also associated (FDR corrected p < 0.05) with higher plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines. Considering evidence of biomarkers of metabolic stress, it is of potential concern that our current treatment strategy for SAM regardless of HIV status involves a high-fat therapeutic diet. The results of this study suggest a need for clinical trials of therapeutic foods that meet the specific metabolic needs of children with HIV and SAM. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Mortality risk is known to be associated with many physiological or biochemical risk factors, and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) may offer an additional or alternative approach to risk stratification. We have compared the predictive value of common biochemical tests, PRSs and information on parental survival in a cohort of twins and their families. Common biochemical test results were available for up to 13,365 apparently healthy men and women, aged 17-93 years (mean 49.0, standard deviation [SD] 13.7) at blood collection. PRSs for longevity were available for 14,169 study participants and reported parental survival for 25,784 participants. A search for information on date and cause of death was conducted through the Australian National Death Index, with median follow-up of 11.3 years. Cox regression was used to evaluate associations with mortality from all causes, cancers, cardiovascular diseases and other causes. Linear relationships with all-cause mortality were strongest for C-reactive protein, gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose and alkaline phosphatase, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.16 (95% CI [1.07, 1.24]), 1.15 (95% CI 1.04-1.21), 1.13 (95% CI [1.08, 1.19]) and 1.11 (95% CI [1.05, 1.88]) per SD difference, respectively. Significant nonlinear effects were found for urea, uric acid and butyrylcholinesterase. Lipid risk factors were not statistically significant for mortality in our cohort. Family history and PRS showed weaker but significant associations with survival, with HR in the range 1.05 to 1.09 per SD difference. In conclusion, biochemical tests currently predict long-term mortality more strongly than genetic scores based on genotyping or on reported parental survival. ©},

abstract={Human Carboxylesterase 2A (hCES2A), one of the most important serine hydrolases, plays crucial roles in the hydrolysis and the metabolic activation of a wide range of esters and amides. Increasing evidence has indicated that potent inhibition on intestinal hCES2A may reduce the excessive accumulation of SN-38 (the hydrolytic metabolite of irinotecan with potent cytotoxicity) in the intestinal tract and thereby alleviate the intestinal toxicity triggered by irinotecan. In this study, more than sixty natural alkaloids have been collected and their inhibitory effects against hCES2A are assayed using a fluorescence-based biochemical assay. Following preliminary screening, seventeen alkaloids are found with strong to moderate hCES2A inhibition activity. Primary structure–activity relationships (SAR) analysis of natural isoquinoline alkaloids reveal that the benzo-1,3-dioxole group and the aromatic pyridine structure are beneficial for hCES2A inhibition. Further investigations demonstrate that a steroidal alkaloid reserpine exhibits strong hCES2A inhibition activity (IC50 = 0.94 μM) and high selectivity over other human serine hydrolases including hCES1A, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and thrombin. Inhibition kinetic analyses demonstrated that reserpine acts as a non-competitive inhibitor against hCES2A-mediated FD hydrolysis. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated that the potent inhibition of hCES2A by reserpine could partially be attributed to its strong σ-π and S-π interactions between reserpine and hCES2A. Collectively, our findings suggest that reserpine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of hCES2A, which can be served as a promising lead compound for the development of more efficacious and selective alkaloids-type hCES2A inhibitors for biomedical applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective(s): This study aimed to investigate the effect of bee venom, a form of alternative therapy, on rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in mice. Moreover, the possible modulation by bee venom of the effect of L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline was examined. Materials and Methods: Rotenone (1.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously; SC) was administered every other day for two weeks and at the same time mice received the vehicle (DMSO, SC), bee venom (0.065, 0.13, and 0.26 mg/kg; intradermal; ID), L-dopa/carbidopa (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; IP), L-dopa/ carbidopa+bee venom (0.13 mg/kg, ID), rasagiline (1 mg/kg, IP) or rasagiline+bee venom (0.13 mg/kg, ID). Then, wire hanging and staircase tests were performed and mice were euthanized and brains' striata separated. Oxidative stress biomarkers namely, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured. Additionally, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and dopamine (DA) were evaluated. Brain histopathological changes and caspase-3- expression were done. Results: Bee venom significantly enhanced motor performance and inhibited rotenone-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, observed as a reduction in both MDA and NO along with increasing GSH, PON-1, and TAC. Besides, bee venom decreased MCP-1, TNF-α, and caspase-3 expression together with an increase in BuChE activity and DA content. Conclusion: Bee venom alone or in combination with L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline alleviated neuronal degeneration compared with L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline treatment only. Bee venom via its antioxidant and cytokine reducing potentials might be of value either alone or as adjunctive therapy in the management of PD. © 2020 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

abstract={The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a LC–MS/MS method for quantification of 15 phytochemicals in Hypericum species. The developed method was fully validated in terms of repeatability (inter-day and intra-day precision), limits of detection and quantification, linearity, recovery and relative standard uncertainty. The developed and validated LC–MS/MS method was applied to determine 15 phytochemicals in the ethanol extracts of H. lysimachioides var. spathulatum aerial parts (HLS-A) and roots (HLS-R). Hyperoside was found to be the major compound in HLS-A and HLS-R ethanol extracts (16,560.3 and 3561.6 µg analyte/g extract, respectively). According to the results of GC–MS analyses, cis-13,16-docosadienoic acid (35.0%), caryophyllene oxide (24.33%) and undecane (28.21%) were determined as the major components in fatty acid, essential oil and aroma compositions of H. lysimachioides var. spathulatum, respectively. HLS-A and HLS-R ethanol extracts showed moderate activity in ABTS cation radical decolorization assay. The major components (hyperoside, astragalin, and quercetin) present in HLS-A and HLS-R ethanol extracts were found to have also the highest antioxidant effect in ABTS cation radical scavenging method. The extracts, main constituents in the extracts and essential oil had no toxic-cytotoxic potential against PDF, MCF-7 and HT-29 cell lines. HLS-A ethanol extract and essential oil exhibited high butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Quercetin showed the highest inhibitory effect against acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase, urease and tyrosinase among the tested samples. According to biological activity studies, H. lysimachioides var. spathulatum and their major components might be promoted as promising sources of natural agents and used in the development of nutraceuticals, functional food ingredients and pharmaceutical industry. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Design and development of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) has become a very important approach in the search of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In our present research, a number of xanthone derivatives were first designed using a pharmacophore model for histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists/inverse agonists, and virtual docking was then performed for the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Next, 23 compounds were synthesised and evaluated in vitro for human H3R (hH3R) affinity and inhibitory activity on cholinesterases. Most of the target compounds showed hH3R affinities in nanomolar range and exhibited cholinesterase inhibitory activity with IC50 values in submicromolar range. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of monoamine oxidases (MAO) A and B were investigated. The results showed low micromolar and selective human MAO B (hMAO B) inhibition. Two azepane derivatives, namely 23 (2-(5-(azepan-1-yl)pentyloxy)-9H-xanthen-9-one) and 25 (2-(5-(azepan-1-yl)pentyloxy)-7-chloro-9H-xanthen-9-one), were especially very promising and showed high affinity for hH3R (Ki = 170 nM and 100 nM respectively) and high inhibitory activity for acetylcholinesterase (IC50 = 180 nM and 136 nM respectively). Moreover, these compounds showed moderate inhibitory activity for butyrylcholinesterase (IC50 = 880 nM and 394 nM respectively) and hMAO B (IC50 = 775 nM and 897 nM respectively). Furthermore, molecular docking studies were performed for hH3R, human cholinesterases and hMAO B to describe the mode of interactions with these biological targets. Next, the two most promising compounds 23 and 25 were selected for in vivo studies. The results showed significant memory-enhancing effect of compound 23 in dizocilpine-induced amnesia in rats in two tests: step-through inhibitory avoidance paradigm (SIAP) and transfer latency paradigm time (TLPT). In addition, favourable analgesic effects of compound 23 were observed in neuropathic pain models. Therefore, compound 23 is a particularly promising structure for further design of new MTDLs for AD. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Ethnobotanical and plant-based products allow for the isolation of active constituents against a number of maladies. Monotheca buxifolia is used by local communities due to its digestive and laxative properties, as well as its ability to cure liver, kidney, and urinary diseases. There is a need to explore the biological activities and chemical constituents of this medicinal plant. Methods: In this work, the biochemical potential of M. buxifolia (Falc.) A. DC was explored and linked with its biological activities. Methanol and chloroform extracts from leaves and stems were investigated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS) was used to determine secondary-metabolite composition, while high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detection (HPLC–PDA) was used for polyphenolic quantification. In addition, we carried out in vitro assays to determine antioxidant potential and the enzyme-inhibitory response of M. buxifolia extracts. Results: Phenolics (91 mg gallic-acid equivalent (GAE)/g) and flavonoids (48.86 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g) exhibited their highest concentration in the methanol extract of stems and the chloroform extract of leaves, respectively. UHPLC–MS analysis identified a number of important phytochemicals, belonging to the flavonoid, phenolic, alkaloid, and terpenoid classes of secondary metabolites. The methanol extract of leaves contained a diosgenin derivative and polygalacin D, while kaempferol and robinin were most abundant in the chloroform extract. The methanol extract of stems contained a greater peak area for diosgenin and kaempferol, whereas this was true for lucidumol A and 3-O-cis-coumaroyl maslinic acid in the chloroform extract. Rutin, epicatechin, and catechin were the main phenolics identified by HPLC–PDA analysis. The methanol extract of stems exhibited significant 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical-scavenging activities (145.18 and 279.04 mmol Trolox equivalent (TE)/g, respectively). The maximum cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) (361.4 mg TE/g), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (247.19 mg TE/g), and total antioxidant potential (2.75 mmol TE/g) were depicted by the methanol extract of stems. The methanol extract of leaves exhibited stronger inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glucosidase, while the chloroform extract of stems was most active against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (4.27 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g). Similarly, the highest tyrosinase (140 mg kojic-acid equivalent (KAE)/g) and amylase (0.67 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g) inhibition was observed for the methanol extract of stems. Conclusions: UHPLC–MS analysis and HPLC–PDA quantification identified a number of bioactive secondary metabolites of M. buxifolia, which may be responsible for its antioxidant potential and enzyme-inhibitory response. M. buxifolia can be further explored for the isolation of its active components to be used as a drug. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={In recent times, review topics on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have received massive attention, especially on drug design and development of potent inhibitors targeting specific pathway(s) of this multifaceted disease. Drug design and development through the use of computer has taken an intriguing dimension over the last two decades, and AD drug design is not an exception. Computational approaches have found usage in identifying potentially active molecules targeting specific enzyme or gene in the pathological pathway of a disease such as AD. Herein, we present an overview of research contributions over the last ten years from different authors who had used computational approaches to explore potent dual inhibitors of the cholinesterase enzymes linked with AD pathogenesis. We gave an introductory background of the disease, highlight challenges of in silico approach to drug design, and discuss its pros and cons. The overview also covers previously reported review works which are related to the topic. We proposed that continued research efforts to unravel more effective dual acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors through computational tools could plausibly be a successful approach to AD cure. Computational researchers should leverage on the available cost-effective resources to identify lead compounds and work in collaboration with experimental personnel to push their discovery forward. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={The present study outlines the phenolic composition and pharmacological properties of different extracts of Digitalis cariensis Boiss. ex Jaub. & Spach root and aerial parts. The metabolic profiles of the studied extracts were characterized by UHPLC-MS. The in vitro antioxidant and enzyme (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase) inhibitory potential of the extracts were determined. Bioinformatics and docking investigations were also conducted to support the enzyme inhibition test and predict putative targets for potential pharmacological applications. Overall, the methanolic extract followed by the water extract of the D. cariensis root were found to be superior source of antioxidant compounds except for metal chelating ability, in which the water extract of the root (26.34 ± 1.54 mg EDTAE/g) and aerial parts (16.47 ± 0.88 mg EDTAE/g) have showed the highest activity. The tested extracts were potent against AChE (9.11 ± 0.27–9.79 ± 0.28 mg GEs/g extract), α-amylase (0.12 ± 0.01- 0.50 ± 0.01 mmol ACEs/g extract) and α-glucosidase (0.28 ± 0.01–17.29 ± 0.24 mmol ACEs/ g extract). Notable activity against tyrosinase was displayed by the methanolic extracts (Root-MeOH: 123.71 ± 2.70 and aerial parts - MeOH: 137.96 ± 1.07 mg KAE/g extract), while none of the extracts were potent against BChE. According to docking investigations, the observed anti-tyrosinase effect could be related, at least partially, to the presence of luteolin, rosmarinic acid and kaempferol in the extracts. Results amassed herein is the first report on the biological attributes of D. cariensis, which validate the pharmacological uses of this plant. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Breynia retusa (Dennst.) Alston (also known as Cup Saucer plant) is a food plant with wide applications in traditional medicine, particularly in Ayurveda. Extracts obtained with four solvents (dichloromethane, methanol, ethyl acetate and water), from three plant parts, (fruit, leaf and bark) were obtained. Extracts were tested for total phenolic, flavonoid content and antioxidant activities using a battery of assays including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (phosphomolybdenum) and metal chelating. Enzyme inhibitory effects were investigated using acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, α-amylase and α-glucosidase as target enzymes. Results showed that the methanolic bark extract exhibited significant radical scavenging activity (DPPH: 202.09 ± 0.15; ABTS: 490.12 ± 0.18 mg Trolox equivalent (TE)/g), reducing potential (FRAP: 325.86 ± 4.36: CUPRAC: 661.82 ± 0.40 mg TE/g) and possessed the highest TAC (3.33 ± 0.13 mmol TE/g). The methanolic extracts were subjected to LC-DAD-MSn and NMR analysis. A two-column LC method was developed to separate constituents, allowing to identify and quantify forty-four and fifteen constituents in bark and fruits, respectively. Main compound in bark was epicatechin-3-O-sulphate and isolation of compound was performed to confirm its identity. Bark extract contained catechins, procyanidins, gallic acid derivatives and the sulfur containing spiroketal named breynins. Aerial parts mostly contained flavonoid glycosides. Considering the bioassays, the methanolic bark extract resulted a potent tyrosinase (152.79 ± 0.27 mg kojic acid equivalent/g), α-amylase (0.99 ± 0.01 mmol acarbose equivalent ACAE/g) and α-glucosidase (2.16 ± 0.01 mmol ACAE/g) inhibitor. In conclusion, methanol is able to extract the efficiently the phytoconstituents of B. retusa and the bark is the most valuable source of compounds.},

abstract={Reduced brain glucose consumption arising from impaired glucose uptake and utilization has been linked to the pathogenesis and complications of neurodegenerative diseases. The ability of Cannabis sativa L. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-rich extracts to stimulate brain glucose uptake and utilization as well as its modulatory effect on gluconeogenesis, antioxidative, purinergic and cholinergic activities were investigated in isolated rats’ brains. C. sativa leaves were sequentially extracted to yield the hexane and dichloromethane extracts. The extracts were incubated at 37°C with freshly harvested brains in the presence of glucose for 2 h. The control consisted of incubation without the extracts, while brains without the extracts and glucose served as the normal control. Metformin was used as the standard drug. C. sativa extracts caused a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in brain glucose uptake, with concomitant elevation of glutathione level, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase activities compared to the controls. Incubation with C. sativa extracts also led to depletion in malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, glucose 6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities. GC-MS analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of THC. In silico analysis predicted THC to be permeable across the blood-brain-barrier. THC was also predicted to have an oral LD50 and toxicity class values of 482 mg/kg and 4 respectively. These results indicate that C. sativa improves glucose consumption with concomitant suppression of oxidative stress and cholinergic dysfunction, and modulation of purinergic and gluconeogenic activities in brain tissues © Copyright © 2020 Erukainure, Matsabisa, Salau and Islam.},

abstract={Liver S9 (LS9) is a nearly complete collection of all hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. It is a low-cost model for predicting drug metabolic activity. This study aimed to identify the suitability of using LS9 of different animal sources in drug metabolism profiling with respect to the possible translation of the in vitro outcomes to clinical studies. The in vitro hepatic metabolism of curcumin diethyl disuccinate (CDD) in LS9 of rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans was evaluated. The identity of CDD metabolites and the metabolism kinetic parameters, including degradation rate constant, in vitro/in vivo intrinsic clearance, and half-life, were determined. CDD was rapidly metabolized into monoethylsuccinyl curcumin and curcumin in LS9 of all tested species mainly by carboxylesterases (CESs), including CES1 and CES2, and butyrylcholinesterase. The in vitro intrinsic clearance of CDD was in the order of human > dog > monkey > rat, whereas that of monoethylsuccinyl curcumin in the order of dog > monkey > human > rat; this parameter was not correlated with their respective in vivo clearance, which followed the order of dog > monkey > rat > human. Therefore, in vitro drug metabolism data inferred from LS9 of nonhuman origin, especially from monkeys and dogs, cannot be used as preclinical data for human trials, as humans have a smaller liver-to-body weight ratio than monkeys, dogs, and rats. The in vivo drug metabolism is dictated by the anatomical factors of the test subject. © Copyright © 2020 Rojsitthisak, Jithavech, Ratnatilaka Na Bhuket, Supasena, Qiu, Ye, Wu and Wong.},

abstract={Metabolically regulated transgenic rice cell suspension culture has been developed aiming to be an efficient and cost-effective platform for production of rice-recombinant butyrylcholinesterase (rrBChE) that could be used as a bioscavenger enzyme against organophosphate nerve agents. In two-stage batch cultures, switching between growth and induction phases by exchanging media, the maximum active rrBChE levels were comparable among the bioreactor runs with controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations from 10–40% DO and without controlled DO at constant aeration rate. For a single-stage batch operation with no media exchange at 40% DO, production of rrBChE is triggered simply through sugar depletion due to the uptake of sugar by the cells, showing similar maximum active cell-associated rrBChE level compared to two-stage batch operations. However, the bioreactor process using uncontrolled DO, no media exchange, and half-concentration of sucrose resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in the maximum total active rrBChE (77 μg/g fresh weight) and 1.6-fold increase of total active rrBChE specific productivity (86 μg (g dry weight)−1 day−1) compared to the two-stage batch cultures. We found that monitoring the culture pH is a simple non-invasive technique that can help identify the start and progress of the induction phase in a single-stage culture. Altogether, we demonstrate a simplified, efficient, economical, and scalable bioreactor process for rrBChE production in metabolically regulated transgenic rice cell cultures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Multitarget molecular hybrids of N-benzyl pyrrolidine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the synthesized compounds, 4k and 4o showed balanced enzyme inhibitions against cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) and BACE-1. Both leads showed considerable PAS-AChE binding capability, excellent brain permeation, potential disassembly of Aβ aggregates, and neuroprotective activity against Aβ-induced stress. Compounds 4k and 4o also ameliorated cognitive dysfunction against the scopolamine-induced amnesia model in the Y-maze test. The ex vivo study signified attenuated brain AChE activity and antioxidant potential of compounds 4k and 4o. Furthermore, compound 4o also showed improvement in Aβ-induced cognitive dysfunction by the Morris water maze test with excellent oral absorption characteristics ascertained by the pharmacokinetic study. In silico molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies of leads suggested their consensual binding affinity toward PAS-AChE in addition to aspartate dyad of BACE-1. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To design and synthesize flavonoid-polyamine derivatives and investigate their cholinesterase inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity in vitro. METHODS: The target compounds were synthesized in five steps from the starting material resorcinol. Their inhibitory activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were screened by Ellman method. The interaction mode with AChE was studied by enzyme kinetics and molecular docking method. The in vitro toxicity against human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) was evaluated by MTT assay. RESULTS: Seven novel compounds were obtained, and their structures were confirmed by 1H-NMR, ESI-MS and elemental analysis. In vitro bioassay indicated that these compounds had stronger AChE inhibitory activity than the commercial drug rivastigmine, and compound 6g showed strongest activity on AChE with the IC50 value 0.65 μmol•L-1. Enzyme kinetics and molecular modeling results showed that the interaction type of compound 6g with AChE was mixed-type inhibition. Besides, these compounds did not show obvious toxicity against HepG2 and PC12 cell lines at the concentration of 100 μmol•L-1. CONCLUSION: These series of compounds show preferable inhibition for cholinesterases, which are worthy of further study. Copyright 2020 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.},

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an extremely critical hydrolase tightly associated with neurological diseases. Currently, developing specific substrates for imaging AChE activity still remains a great challenge due to the interference from butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and carboxylesterase (CE). Herein, we propose an approach to designing specific substrates for AChE detection by combining dimethylcarbamate choline with a self-immolative scaffold. The representative P10 can effectively eliminate the interference from CE and BChE. The high specificity of P10 has been proved via imaging AChE activity in cells. Moreover, P10 can also be used to successfully map AChE activity in different regions of a normal mouse brain, which may provide important data for AChE evaluation in clinical studies. Such a rational and effective approach can also provide a solid basis for designing probes with different properties to study AChE in biosystems and another way to design specific substrates for other enzymes.

abstract={The inadequate clinical efficacy of the present anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs and their low impact on the progression of Alzheimer's disease in patients have revised the research focus from single targets to multitarget-directed ligands. A novel series of substituted triazinoindole derivatives were obtained by introducing various substituents on the indole ring for the development of multitarget-directed ligands as anti-AD agents. The experimental data indicated that some of these compounds exhibited significant anti-AD properties. Among them, 8-(piperidin-1-yl)-N-(6-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)hexyl)-5H-[1,2,4]triazino[5,6-b]indol-3-amine (60), the most potent cholinesterase inhibitor (AChE, IC50 value of 0.32 μM; BuChE, IC50 value of 0.21 μM), was also found to possess significant self-mediated Aβ1-42 aggregation inhibitory activity (54% at 25 μM concentration). Additionally, compound 60 showed strong antioxidant activity. In the PAMPA assay, compound 60 exhibited blood-brain barrier penetrating ability. An acute toxicity study in rats demonstrated no sign of toxicity at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. Furthermore, compound 60 significantly restored the cognitive deficits in the scopolamine-induced mice model and Aβ1-42-induced rat model. In the in silico ADMET prediction studies, the compound satisfied all the parameters of CNS acting drugs. These results highlighted the potential of compound 60 to be a promising multitarget-directed ligand for the development of potential anti-AD drugs. © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), the primary source of serum cholinesterase activity, is an indispensable biochemical marker for clinical diagnosis of liver function and organophosphorus poisoning. The requirement for bulky and expensive instruments represents a huge hindrance for point-of-care testing (POCT) of BuChE, especially in resource-limited settings. Herein, an easy-operated, economic, and portable photothermal (PT) biosensing platform for high-throughput BuChE detection was rationally designed. BuChE could "light up"the PT signal through in situ generation of Prussian blue (PB) by MIL-53 (Fe), which allowed us to translate biological signals into temperature signals. Such temperature change signals could be monitored at high throughput (six samples for a single measurement) by a miniature self-made integrated PT device via combining separable 96-well plates, a three-dimensional (3D) printed sample bracket, 808 nm lasers, and thermometers, satisfying the requirement for rapid on-site detection in a large batch with low cost. In addition, the large specific surface area, 3D network structure, and high porosity of MIL-53 (Fe) offered a beneficial platform for its reaction with enzymatic hydrolysate, resulting in high sensing sensitivity and low detection limit (0.3 U L-1), which was at least 20 »000 times lower than the normal human serum BuChE activity. This facile, affordable, and broad applicability PT sensing platform provides a beneficial reference for the rational design of other disease diagnostic approaches suitable for POCT. © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OP) has been associated with the inhibition of cholinesterase enzymatic activity, such as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Changes in BuChE activity have been associated with obesity, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and metabolic syndrome. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of pesticides on both BuChE and lipid parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate lipid parameters in urban sprayers and their association with BuChE activity. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in workers exposed to pesticides. The pesticide exposures were evaluated by the measurement of urinary dialkylphosphates. BuChE activity was determined spectrophotometrically in serum, and biochemical parameters were determined at a certified laboratory. Information regarding general characteristics, lifestyle, and other aspects was obtained from a structured questionnaire. The results showed variations in glucose, cholesterol, albumin, atherogenic index, creatinine, LDL, VLDL, triglycerides, and total lipids according to the level of exposure to pesticides in individuals with overweight and obesity. Furthermore, positive correlations between BuChE activity and lipid parameters were observed; these effects were associated with the body mass index. More studies are needed in human population to better elucidate the role of BuChE in lipid metabolism. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Aristotelia serrata, wineberry, or makomako, is a small deciduous fast-growing shrub of New Zealand that produces a berry. In this study leaf extracts were produced using ultrasound technology. Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive mental deterioration related with ageing and senility, in which approved drugs for treatment inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), an enzyme present in the human brain. The ultrasound assisted extraction of natural anti-butyrylcholinesterase and antioxidants from this plant, and the yield of extraction were optimized using response surface methodology. The effect of acoustic power density (0.13–0.65 W/mL), time (2−20 min), and ethanol concentration (20–80%) on BChE inhibition, antioxidant activity, and extraction yield was determined, the optimum extraction conditions being 0.53 W/mL, 17.12 min and 74% ethanol. The optimized extracts were produced to experimentally validate the predicted responses. The IC50 concentrations were experimentally determined (26.2 μg/mL for BChE, 5.5 μg/mL for radical scavenging activity).

abstract={In the current work, a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (CyClCP) was developed for fast (35 min), highly sensitive (LOD of 3.75 U/L) and selective response to BChE in vitro and in vivo. Upon the addition of BChE, CyClCP could be efficiently activated with remarkable NIR (λem = 708 nm) fluorescence enhancement and obvious absorbance red shift (581 nm–687 nm). Specifically, according to the subtle differences structural features and substrate preference between BChE and its sister enzyme AChE, CyClCP was constructed by introducing chlorine atom at the ortho-position of the phenolic hydroxyl in the previous reported probe (CyCP). Fortunately, CyClCP exhibited better selectivity towards BChE over AChE compared with CyCP. This molecular design strategy was further rationalized by docking molecular of fluorescence probes (CyClCP and CyCP) and enzymes (BChE and AChE). Finally, CyClCP was membrane permeable and successfully applied to image endogenous BChE level in HepG2 and LO2 cells. Therefore, CyClCP could serve as a promising tool for BChE-related physiological function studies in complex biological systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

As the results indicate, all compounds reversibly inhibited both enzymes in the micromolar range pointing to the preference of AChE over BChE for binding the tested derivatives. Molecular docking studies revealed the importance of interactions with AChE active site residues Tyr337 and Tyr124, which dictated most of the observed differences. The most potent inhibitor of both enzymes with Ki of 4 µM for AChE and 8 µM for BChE was the nicotinamide derivative 1-(4′-phenylphenacyl)-3-carbamoylpyridinium bromide. Such a result places it within the range of several currently studied novel cholinesterase inhibitors. Cytotoxicity profiling did not classify this compound as highly toxic, but the induced effects on cells should not be neglected in any future detailed studies and when considering this scaffold for drug development. © 2020 by the authors.

Inhibitors of CA isoenzymes are important therapeutic targets, particularly due to their preventive/activation potential in the treatment of diseases such as edema, glaucoma, cancer and osteoporosis. Cholinesterase inhibitors are valuable compounds that can be used in many different therapeutic applications, including Alzheimer's disease. The compound 8 for CA I, AChE and BChE, 2 for CA II showed a very active inhibition profile (KI 45.7 ± 0.46 for CA I, 33.5 ± 0.38 nM for CA II, 31.5 ± 0.33 nM for AChE and 24.4 ± 0.29 nM for BChE).

abstract={Alzheimer's dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the elderly population and causes memory impairment and cognitive deficit. Manifestation of this disease is associated to acetylcholine decrease; thus, Cholinesterase inhibition is the main therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, a series of aporphinoid alkaloids were tested as potential acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors in vitro. Alkaloids liriodenine (3) and cassythicine (10) were the best inhibitors of both cholinesterases with IC50 values lower than 10 μM. In addition, these alkaloids demonstrated better inhibition of BChE than reference drug galantamine. In addition, some alkaloids showed selective inhibition. Laurotetatine clorhydrate (13) selectively inhibit AChE over BChE. On the contrary, pachyconfine (7) interacted more efficiently with BChE active site. Molecular modelling studies were performed in order to illustrate key interactions between most active compounds and the enzymes and to explain their selectivity. These studies reveal that the benzodioxole moiety exhibits strong interactions due to hydrogen bonds that form with the Glu201 (AChE) and Tyr440 (BChE) residues, which is reflected in the IC50 values. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={In this study, the essential oil, aroma, fatty acid, terpeneoid and phenolic contents of Salvia poculata were investigated. Additionally, antioxidant, toxic-cytotoxic activities of essential oil and the ethanol extracts were determined. Moreover, anticholinesterase, antiurease, antityrosinase and antielastase enzymes inhibition activities of the extracts were examined. In GC–MS studies, germacrene D (20.07 %), caryophyllene (17.57 %) and tricosanoic acid (17.01 %) were determined as the major components for essential oil, aroma and fatty acid compositions, respectively. Besides, according to the GC–MS and LC–MS/MS results, this species was determined to contain considerable amounts of ferruginol (9292.9 μg analyte/g extract) and rosmarinic acid (15612.08 μg analyte/g extract). In parallel with the high total phenolic and rosmarinic content of the species, its ethanol extract has a high antioxidant potential. It was determined that the species was not active against acetylcholinesterase enzyme, however, the root ethanol extract showed good activity (Inhibition%: 63.01 ± 1.12) against butyrylcholinesterase enzyme. All extracts of the species were found to have fairly high anti-urease activity (Inhibition%: 89.67 ± 0.72), however, all extracts of S. poculata showed moderate and similar activities in anti-tyrosinase and antielastase activity assays. It can be deducted that the species has potential in food preservative and pharmaceutical industry due to its total phenolic and rosmarinic acid content, antioxidant capacity, antiurease and antibutyrylcholinesterase enzymes activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Due to the lack of effective pharmacotherapy options to treats Alzheimer's disease, new strategies have been approached in the search for multi-target molecules as therapeutic options. In this work, four indole alkaloids, geissoschizoline, geissoschizone, geissospermine, and 3′,4′,5′,6′-tetradehydrogeissospermine were isolated from Geissospermum vellosii (Pao pereira) and evaluated for their anticholinesterase activities. While geissospermine inhibited only butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the other alkaloids behaved as non-selective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BChE. In cell viability tests, only geissoschizoline was not cytotoxic. Therefore, geissoschizoline actions were also evaluated in human cholinesterases, where it was twice as potent inhibitor of hBChE (IC50 = 10.21 ± 0.01 µM) than hAChE (IC50 = 20.40 ± 0.93 µM). On enzyme kinetic studies, geissoschizoline presented a mixed-type inhibition mechanism for both enzymes. Molecular docking studies pointed interactions of geissoschizoline with active site and peripheral anionic site of hAChE and hBChE, indicating a dual site inhibitor profile. Moreover, geissoschizoline also played a promising anti-inflammatory role, reducing microglial release of NO and TNF-α at a concentration (1 μM) ten and twenty times lower than the IC50 values of hBChE and hAChE inhibition, respectively. These actions give geissoschizoline a strong neuroprotective character. In addition, the ability to inhibit hAChE and hBChE, with approximate inhibitory potencies, accredits this alkaloid for therapeutic use in the moderate to severe phase of AD. Thus, geissoschizoline emerges as a possible multi-target prototype that can be very useful in preventing neurodegeneration and restore neurotransmission. © 2020},

abstract={Calligonum polygonoides L. also known as famine food plant, is normally consumed in times of food scarcity in India and Pakistan and also used traditionally in the management of common diseases. The present design aims to provide an insight into the medicinal potential of four solvent extracts of C. polygonoides via an assessment of its phytochemical profile, antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory potential. Phytochemical composition was estimated by deducing total bioactive constituents, UHPLC-MS secondary metabolites profile, and HPLC phenolic quantification. Antioxidant potential was determined via six methods (radical scavenging (DPPH and ABTS), reducing power (FRAP and CUPRAC), phosphomolybdenum total antioxidant capacity and metal chelation activity). Enzyme inhibitory potential was assessed against clinical enzymes (acetylcholinesterase -AChE, butyrylcholinesterase -BChE, tyrosinase, and α-amylase). The highest amounts of phenolic contents were found in chloroform extract (76.59 mg GAE/g extract) which may be attributed to its higher radical scavenging, reducing power and tyrosinase inhibition potential. The n-butanol extract containing the maximum amount of flavonoids (55.84 mg RE/g extract) exhibited highest metal chelating capacity. Similarly, the n-hexane extract was found to be most active against AChE (4.65 mg GALAE/g extract), BChE (6.59 mg GALAE/g extract), and α-amylase (0.70 mmol ACAE/g extract) enzymes. Secondary metabolite assessment of the crude methanol extract as determined by UHPLC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 24 (negative ionization mode) and 15 (positive ionization mode) secondary metabolites, with most of them belonging to phenolic, flavonoids, terpene, and alkaloid groups. Moreover, gallic acid and naringenin were the main phenolics quantified by HPLC-PDA analysis in all the tested extracts (except n-butanol extract). PCA statistical analysis was also conducted to establish any possible relationship amongst bioactive contents and biological activities. Overall, the C. polygonoides extracts could be further considered to isolate bioactive enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant natural phytocompounds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Asteraceae species Tanacetum macrophyllum (Walds. & Kit.) Sch.Bip. (Tm) and Telekia speciosa (Schreb.) Baumg. (Ts) are renowned for their ethnomedicinal use. This work aims to provide an in-depth characterization of the methanol-aqueous extracts from the flower heads, aerial parts and roots of the species. Annotation and dereplication of 113 secondary metabolites was achieved in the studied samples; 63 compounds are reported in the species for the first time. Herein, 38 acylquinic acids analogues, 31 flavonols and flavones, 17 sesquiterpene lactones together with phenylethanoid glycosides and sugar esters were evidenced in the assayed extracts. The principal component and heat-map analysis identified 20 marker metabolites that revealed herbal drug-specific chemical patterns: phenylethanoid glycosides, quinic, chlorogenic and 3-feruloyl-4-caffeoylquinic acid, patuletin, eupatorin, quercetagetin-trimethyl ether, artecalin and artemisiifolin had the highest contribution in variance. The esters of caffeic/ferulic acid-hexoside were exclusively produced by T. speciosa while methoxylated flavonoids were evidenced in T. macrophyllum. According to the multivariate analysis of biological potential, radical scavenging activity and reducing power accounted mostly for the stronger antioxidant capacity of Tm in comparison with Ts. Telekia specosa aerial parts and roots had marked impact on acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (up to 4.82 ± 0.22 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g and 3.20 ± 0.30 mg GALAE/g, respectively) and tyrosinase (up to 119.00 ± 0.97 mg kojic acid equivalent/g) inhibition. Tanacetum macrophyllum aerial parts and flower heads were beneficial for attenuating carbohydrate metabolism disorders witnessed by α-glucosidase (1.45 ± 0.27 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g) and α-amylase (0.65 ± 0.04 mmol ACAE/g) inhibitory activity. Tanacetum macrophyllum flower heads and T. speciosa roots can be recommended for production of raw material with antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory potential. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this study, Salvia aegyptiaca and Salvia verbenaca aerial part decoction and methanol extracts (SAE DE, SAE ME, SVR DE, and SVR ME) were screened for their in vitro antioxidant, anti-Alzheimer, and antidiabetic enzymes inhibition activities. The antioxidant properties of Salvia extracts were determined using DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS radical scavenging, Alkaline DMSO superoxide radical scavenging, β-carotene bleaching, reducing power, and metal chelating activity assays. All extracts showed high antioxidant capacity and the antioxidant properties with the best performance were detected in the SAE ME and SVR ME. The extracts of S. aegyptiaca and S. verbenaca showed a low inhibitory activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whereas, the methanol extract of S. aegyptiaca had the highest inhibitory activity on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (71.60 ± 4.33% for 100 µg/ml) compared to the other extracts. In vitro inhibitory effect on diabetic enzymes showed that the ME inhibited α-amylase enzyme with an IC50 86 and 101 µg/ml for SAE and SVR, respectively. Similarly, both extracts inhibited α-glucosidase with (IC50 97 and 150 µg/ml, respectively). The decoction extracts exhibited lower activity on both enzymes. Practical applications: It is becoming evident that oxidative stress is involved in several acute and chronic diseases. Counteracting free radical generation has become one of the widest fields of research worldwide. This study deals with the in vitro antioxidant activity of two plants from the Salvia genus as well as the assessment of their in vitro inhibitory properties of four key enzymes implicated in diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Concerning the practical applications of our work, it can be explored in its antioxidant part as a food supplement to prevent the excess of free radicals in the body and also in other industrial practices. Another potential use is in the prevention and amelioration of both diabetes and Alzheimer's disease symptoms for the extracts that had enzyme inhibitory activity, but this deserves further toxicological and in vivo studies. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Anagallis arvensis (L.) is a wild edible food plant that has been used in folklore as a natural remedy for treating common ailments. This study aimed to explore the biochemical properties and toxicity of methanol (MeOH) and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of A. arvensis (aerial and root parts). Bioactive contents were assessed spectrophotometrically, and the secondary metabolites were identified by UHPLC-MS analysis. DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC, phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating assays were employed to assess antioxidant activity. Inhibitory potential against key enzymes (α-glucosidase, urease, lipoxygenase (LOX), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)) were also assessed. MTT assay was employed to test toxicity against SW-480, MDA-MB-231, CaSki, MCF-7, and DU-145 cancer cell lines. Methanolic extracts showed highest phenolic (aerial-MeOH: 27.5 mg GAE/g extract; root-MeOH: 21.17 mg GAE/g extract) and flavonoid (aerial-MeOH: 26.15 mg QE/g extract; root-MeOH: 19.07 mg QE/g extract) contents, and potent antioxidant activities. The aerial-MeOH extract was most potent for DPPH (IC50: 231 ug/mL), ABTS (131.12 mg TE/g extract), FRAP (82.97 mg TE/g extract), and CUPRAC (137.15 mg TE/g extract) antioxidant assays. All extracts were cytotoxic towards tested cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 12.57 to 294.5 µg/mL and conferred a comparatively strong inhibition against α-glucosidase (aerial-DCM extract showed the highest inhibition against α-glucosidase with IC50 value of 20.97 µg /mL), while aerial extracts were also considerably active against BChE (aerial-MeOH IC50: 224.63 µg /mL), LOX (aerial-DCM IC50: 385.7 µg /mL). Likewise, aerial-MeOH extract was most active against urease enzyme (IC50: 129.72 µg /mL). UHPLC-MS investigation of methanolic extracts showed the existence of important phenolics, flavonoids, and saponins, including methyl gallte, quercetin, lanceoletin, and balanitesin, amongst others. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted the correlation amongst bioactive contents and observed biological activities. A. arvensis extracts could be regarded as a natural source of bioactive antioxidants, enzyme inhibitors and anticancer agents and can be further investigated as a lead source for food and pharmaceutical products. However, further studies to isolate, purify, and to characterize its bioactive phytochemicals are needed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Chronic dietary ingestion of suitable phytochemicals may assist with limiting or negating neurodegenerative decline. Current therapeutics used to treat Alzheimer disease elicit broad adverse drug reactions, and alternative sources of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are required. Herein, we screened methanolic extracts from seven commonly cultivated plants for their nutraceutical potential; ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE), and provision of antioxidant activity through their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging capabilities. Potential neurotoxicity of plant extracts was examined via application to SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells and quantitation of cell viability. Methanolic extracts of Citrus limon (Lemon), Bombax ceiba (Red silk-cotton), Lawsonia inermis (Henna), Eucalyptus globulus (Eucalyptus), Ocimum basilicum (Basil), Citrus reticulata (Mandarin orange), and Mentha spicata (Spearmint) all displayed concentration-dependent inhibition of AChE and BuChE. The majority of extracts inhibited AChE and BuChE to near equipotency, with Henna and Eucalyptus extracts the two most potent ChEIs. All plant extracts were able to scavenge free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner, with Eucalyptus the most potent antioxidant. Toxicity of plant extracts to neuronal cells was concentration dependent, with Eucalyptus also the most toxic extract. Fractionation of plant extracts and analysis by mass spectrometry identified a number of plant polyphenols that might have contributed to the cholinesterase inhibition: 3-caffeoylquinic acid, methyl 4-caffeoylquinate, kaempferol-acetyl-glycoside, quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin-acetyl-glycoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-glucoside. In silico molecular modeling of these polyphenols demonstrated their improved AChE and BuChE binding affinities compared to the current FDA-approved dual ChEI, galantamine. Collectively, all the plant extracts contained nutraceutical agents as antioxidants and ChEIs and, therefore, their chronic consumption may prove beneficial to combat the pathological deficits that accrue in Alzheimer disease. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Extracellular matrix (ECM) exerts a major role in maintaining the structure and developmental processes of tissues. To form the tubular basement membrane in the kidney, sulfate proteoglycans, collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and other glycoproteins congregate in the ECM. As an insecticide, diazinon (DZN) may alter the proportion of ECM by cholinesterase activity inhibition and oxidative stress. The naturally, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) plays an effective and therapeutic role in the treatment of toxicities and diseases in the body. In the current study, an attempt was made to evaluate the impacts of alpha-lipoic acid on the distribution of fibronectin and laminin in the renal tubules of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon. In this study, the animal groups comprised 30 adult male Wistar rats (almost three months old) randomly distributed into the following groups; control, DZN (40 mg/kg), DZN + ALA (40 mg/kg+100 mg/kg), ALA (100 mg/kg), and sham. The rats were anesthetized after six weeks. Blood sampling was performed, and kidneys were removed for immunohistochemistry study. Diazinon reduced the distribution of fibronectin and laminin and significantly inhibited cholinesterase activity in the renal tubules. Furthermore, urea and creatinine levels were higher in diazinon than in other groups. ALA in the co-treatment group enhanced cholinesterase activity and distribution of both glycoproteins in the renal tubules. Urea and creatinine levels were meaningfully diminished in the DZN + ALA group. The nephrotoxic effect of diazinon in vivo was the reduced distribution of laminin and fibronectin, probably induced by cholinesterase activity inhibition. As an antioxidant with specific properties, ALA reduces the nephrotoxic effects of diazinon by multifarious mechanisms. © 2020},

abstract={Ranunculus muricatus L. is a spiny fruit buttercup that is used in various traditional medicinal systems. In the current investigation of R. muricatus, the new chalcone 4-benzyloxylonchocarpin (1), the new anthraquinone muracatanes A (2), the new-to-nature anthraquinone muracatanes B (3), and the new naphthalene analog muracatanes C (4) were isolated, in addition to the three previously reported compounds, 4-methoxylonchocarpin (5), β-sitosterol (6), and β-sitosterol β-D-glucopyranoside (7). Their structures were elucidated using 1D (1H and13C) and 2D (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) NMR spectroscopy and HR-ESI-MS. Chalcone 1 showed potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effects with Ki of 5.39 µM and Ki′ of 3.54 µM, but none of the isolated compounds showed inhibitory activity towards butyrylcholinesterase. Anthraquinone 3 illustrated α-glucosidase inhibitory effects with IC50-values of 164.46 ± 83.04 µM. Compound 5 displayed moderate cytotoxic activity towards ovarian carcinoma (A2780, IC50 = 25.4 µM), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29, IC50 = 20.2 µM), breast cancer (MCF7, IC50 = 23.7 µM), and thyroid carcinoma (SW1736, IC50 = 26.2 µM) while it was inactive towards pharynx carcinoma (FaDu: IC50 &gt; 30 µM). © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Acute organophosphate (OP) poisoning, particularly by suicide attempts, generates high mortality and morbidity. Few studies have systematically addressed the consequences of acute OP intoxication on cognition and memory of survivors. Preclinical evidence suggests that acute OP-induced effects are associated with inhibiting the brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme. The OP triazophos has been used worldwide, although its effects on mnemonic processing are yet to be investigated. Based on the above, the present study investigated whether acute triazophos intoxication interferes with the expression and extinction of contextual fear memory in rats. Hippocampal and amygdalar AChE activity and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were measured at the end of the experiment to confirm the cholinergic overstimulation. Independent cohorts of animals intoxicated with triazophos were evaluated in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, a less aversive associative memory task. At the dose of 15 mg/kg, triazophos administered immediately after contextual fear conditioning impaired the extinction but not the expression of freezing behavior. Triazophos poisoning induced no changes in the discrimination index in the NOR test. Triazophos inhibited the AChE activity in a time- and brain region-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that fear memory extinction deficits induced by acute triazophos intoxication are accompanied by hippocampal AChE inhibition. The deficient fear extinction associated with acute OP poisoning may represent a behavioral and biochemical phenotype helpful to study mechanisms of neurotoxicity and treatment approach of OP suicide survivors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={α-Mangostin has been reported to possess a broad range of pharmacological effects including potent cholinesterase inhibition, but the development of α-mangostin as a potential lead compound is impeded by its toxicity. The present study investigated the impact of simple structural modification of α-mangostin on its cholinesterase inhibitory activities and toxicity toward neuroblastoma and liver cancer cells. The dialkylated derivatives retained good acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities with IC50 values between 4.15 and 6.73 µM, but not butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities, compared with α-mangostin, a dual inhibitor (IC50: AChE, 2.48 µM; BChE, 5.87 µM). Dialkylation of α-mangostin produced AChE selective inhibitors that formed hydrophobic interactions at the active site of AChE. Interestingly, all four dialkylated derivatives of α-mangostin showed much lower cytotoxicity, being 6.4- to 9.0-fold and 3.8- to 5.5-fold less toxic than their parent compound on neuroblastoma and liver cancer cells, respectively. Likewise, their selectivity index was higher by 1.9- to 4.4-fold; in particular, A2 and A4 showed improved selectivity index compared with α-mangostin. Taken together, modification of the hydroxyl groups of α-mangostin at positions C-3 and C-6 greatly influenced its BChE inhibitory and cytotoxic but not its AChE inhibitory activities. These dialkylated derivatives are viable candidates for further structural modification and refinement, worthy in the search of new AChE inhibitors with higher safety margins. © 2020 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft},

abstract={Organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNAs) are an essential class of internationally banned chemical warfare agents that broadly target a family of enzymes known as serine hydrolases. In the body, OPNAs bind to butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), albumin and other proteins to form nerve agent adducts. These adducts can develop reliable, long-term protein biomarkers for human exposure to nerve agents. Red blood cells (RBC) are known targets of OPNAs toxicity effects. Since erythrocytes have a relatively long half-life, they may serve as a valuable tool for OPNA exposure verification. In the present report, a new, simple, and less expensive approach for detection of nerve agent exposure using alkaline hydrolysis of RBC membrane proteins, is evaluated. In this method, the hemoglobin-free ghost of human erythrocyte is prepared from 6 mL of sarin (GB) spiked RBC sample, and then treated with sodium hydroxide solution. In the presence of sodium hydroxide and elevated temperature, isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA) is released from RBC protein-sarin adducts. Two dimensional Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is employed for clean-up. The monitoring of IMPA using LC-MS/MS demonstrates that GB is added to RBC proteins. In the quantitative analysis of GB adducts, the calibration curve was found to be linear over a range of 10–100 µg L−1, and the limit of detection was 1 µg L−1. Our results indicate that membrane proteins of human erythrocyte could be exploited as a surrogate biomarker of nerve agent exposure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Diospyros discolor is commonly known as 'buah mentega' and traditionally used to treat various diseases. Many compounds especially triterpenes in Diospyros sp. were reported to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes in vitro and in vivo. D. discolor was reported to contain triterpenes, yet to be investigated for their AChE inhibitory activity. D. discolor leaves extract showed high (95.80 ± 1.57 %) AChE inhibitory activity at the concentration of 100 µg/mL. Objective: The aim of the present study is to identify chemical constituents from D. discolor and their AChE inhibitory activity. Materials and Methods: The leaves and stem barks of D. discolor were air dried, powdered and successively extracted using n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol. The solvents were evaporated to obtain dried crude extracts. The compounds were purified using exhaustive chromatographic procedures and their structures were determined by analyses of spectral data. The AChE inhibitory activity was carried out using Ellman's method. Results: A new flavonol, 7,4'-dihydroxy-5,3',5'-trimethoxyflavonol (1), along with five known flavonoids (2-6) and six known triterpenes (7-13) were isolated from the leaves and stem barks of D. discolor. Selected compounds were evaluated for AChE inhibitory activity, in which stigmast-4-ene-3-one (7) showed the lowest inhibition concentration with an IC50 value of 11.77 ± 2.11 µM. Conclusion: A new flavonol (1) and twelve known compounds were identified and characterized. Even though D. discolor extracts showed high percent inhibition against AChE enzyme, the isolated compounds showed moderate inhibition. © 2020 Phcogj.Com.

abstract={The overlapping of tacrine and (7)-huperzine A templates yielded a family of highly potent cholinesterase inhibitors, so-called huprines. A relatively easy access to these compounds led to the development of dozens of huprine derivatives allowing to draw structure ± activity relationship mainly for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes, but also with application to other biological targets of interest. An extension of their pharmacological profile is commonly associated with huprine scaffold binding to some other pharmacophores that yield high-molecular-weight heterodimers. The main purpose in developing the huprine family is related to Alzheimer's disease therapy. However, these compounds are also interesting lead structures in the treatment of other disorders, such as Myasthenia gravis, African trypanosomiasis, malaria, and prion diseases. The present review provides a rationale behind the development of huprines, detailed synthetic routes leading to different classes of huprines, and a thorough discussion of their potential pharmacological applications. © 2020 Uspekhi Khimii, ZIOC RAS, Russian Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Limited},

abstract={Rhaponticoides iconiensis (Hub.-Mor.) M.V.Agab. & Greuter. (Asteraceae) is an endemic species spread in several small populations in the province of Konya (Turkey). It is critically endangered with an extremely high risk of extinction. Recently, based on the molecular phylogenetic and eco geographical studies on Cardueae-Centaureinae, the genus Rhaponticoides Vaill. was separated from Centaurea L. Antioxidant properties and enzyme inhibition, as well as the phenolic and flavonoid contents, of the methanol (Soxhlet extraction and maceration) and water (infusion) extracts of R. iconiensis leaves, roots, and flower heads were determined. The methanol extracts of R. iconiensis leaves contained the highest amount of phenolic (52.37 and 54.37 mg gallic acid equivalent/g) and flavonoids (74.13 and 80.75 mg rutin equivalent/g). Accordingly, the leaves methanol extracts showed the highest antioxidant potential. Interestingly, the roots methanol extracts were the most potent acetylcholinesterase (4.75 mg galantamine equivalent/g) and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors (5.26 and 5.14 mg galantamine equivalent/g). The leaves and roots methanol extracts exhibited high α-glucosidase (2.48–3.08 mmol acarbose equivalent/g) and α-amylase (0.17−0.70 mmol acarbose equivalent/g) inhibition. The highest tyrosinase inhibition was recorded for leaves methanol extracts (138.79 and 140.34 mg kojic acid equivalent/g). 87 natural products (including hydroxybenzoic, hydroxycinnamic and acylquinic acids, flavones, flavonols, flavanones and anthocyanins) were unambiguously identified or tentatively annotated in the studied extracts.

Structural adjustment for AChE seems to have been achieved by acylation, and the furan ring opening of furo-benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene results for compound 51 with the highest AChE affinity (IC50 = 8.3 µM). Interestingly, its analogue, an oxime ether with a benzobicyclo[3.2.1]-skeleton, compound 32 was one of the most potent BChE inhibitors in this study (IC50 = 31 µM), but not as potent as endo-43, an ether derivative of the benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octene with an additional phenyl substituent (IC50 = 17 µM).

abstract={Despite the rapidly increasing number of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes-induced dementia, there are no disease-modifying therapies that are able to prevent or block disease progress. In this work, we investigate the potential of nature-inspired glucosylpolyphenols against relevant targets, including islet amyloid polypeptide, glucosidases, and cholinesterases. Moreover, with the premise of Fyn kinase as a paradigm-shifting target in Alzheimer's drug discovery, we explore glucosylpolyphenols as blockers of Aβ-induced Fyn kinase activation while looking into downstream effects leading to Tau hyperphosphorylation. Several compounds inhibit Aβ-induced Fyn kinase activation and decrease pTau levels at 10 μM concentration, particularly the per-O-methylated glucosylacetophloroglucinol and the 4-glucosylcatechol dibenzoate, the latter inhibiting also butyrylcholinesterase and β-glucosidase. Both compounds are nontoxic with ideal pharmacokinetic properties for further development. This work ultimately highlights the multitarget nature, fine structural tuning capacity, and valuable therapeutic significance of glucosylpolyphenols in the context of these metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. ©},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. The underlying pathologic mechanisms of AD are unclear. Over the decades, the development of single target agent did not lead to any successful treatment for AD. A multitarget agent that could tackle more than one AD phenotype may be helpful as a treatment strategy. Cholinesterases (ChEs) including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), are currently the drug targets with approved treatments. Moreover, amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition is a hallmark of AD that receives considerable attention. Herein, 9Q, a previously reported dual target inhibitor dealing with cholinergic dysfunction and amyloid deposition for AD treatment, has undergone thorough investigations. In vitro studies revealed that 9Q exhibited over 80% inhibition of ChE activity at 100 μM and more than 30% inhibition of Aβ aggregation at 1 mM concentration. Moreover 9Q was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enhance the cerebral acetylcholine level in triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice. Following one month treatment with 9Q, the amyloid burden and the cognitive deficits in 3xTg-AD mice were significantly ameliorated. It was observed that 9Q treatment mitigated synapse dysfunction, decreased amyloidogenic APP processing, and reduced the tau pathology in 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, our results suggested that dual inhibition of cholinesterases and Aβ aggregation could be a promising approach in AD treatment. ©},

The study showed that flavonoids with molecular mass of 250–320 g/mol have high potential of anticholinesterase activities and are valuable for future experiments on animals and humans. Potential inhibitory effects of these molecules on target proteins were investigated using docking and molecular dynamics calculations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A novel series of triazole tethered coumarin-benzotriazole hybrids based on donepezil skeleton has been designed and synthesized as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the synthesized compounds 13b showed most potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (IC50 = 0.059 μΜ) with mixed type inhibition scenario. Structure-activity relationship revealed that three-carbon alkyl chain connecting coumarin and triazole is well tolerable for inhibitory potential. Hybrids obtained from 4-hydroxycoumarin and 1-benzotriazole were most potent AChE inhibitors. The inhibitory potential of all compounds against butyrylcholinesterase was also evaluated but all showed negligible activity suggesting that the hybrid molecules are selective AChE inhibitors. 13b (most potent AChE inhibitor) also showed copper-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation inhibition (34.26% at 50 μΜ) and chelating properties for metal ions (Cu2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+) involved in AD pathogenesis along with DNA protective potential against degenerative actions of [rad]OH radicals. Molecular modelling studies confirm the potential of 13b in blocking both PAS and CAS of AChE. In addition, interactions of 13b with Aβ1-42 monomer are also streamlined. Therefore, hybrid 13b can act as an effective hit lead molecule for further development of selective AChE inhibitors as multifunctional anti-Alzheimer's agents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Scorzonera tomentosa L. (family Asteraceae), endemic to Turkey is reputed for its medicinal attributes in the folkloric medicine. However, only few studies on the chemical composition and pharmacological properties of this plant have been published so far. In this direction, this study aimed to shed light on the phenolic composition, antioxidant and key enzyme inhibitory properties of S. tomentosa aerial parts and roots extracts prepared using different solvents (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, hexane, water and methanol). Overall, the methanolic extracts and the infusion of both plant parts were better sources of total polyphenolics with 40.33 and 39.30 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g, respectively, while for the aerial parts, 22.42 and 21.84 mg GAE/g were measured for methanolic extract and root infusion, respectively. Extracts of the aerial parts showed considerable amount of total flavonoid content (2.96–34.93 mg rutin equivalent (RE)/g) as compared with the root extract (0.40–2.65 mg RE/g), with highest content observed in methanolic extract. For this reason, the methanolic extract of roots and aerial parts were subjected to liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MSn) analysis. The methanolic and aqueous extracts of both plant parts proved to be most significant radical quenchers (1.05–45.89 mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay; and 1.82–82.94 mg TE/g in 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay) and reducing agents (39.40–164.06 mg TE/g in cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and 15.54–79.78 mg TE/g in ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)). The dichloromethane extracts were significant metal chelators (13.92 and 6.24 mg ethylenediaminetetraacetate equivalent (EDTAE)/g for aerial parts and roots). Extracts of both plant parts showed selective inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Notable anti-tyrosinase activity was observed for all the extracts (aerial part: 16.40 ± 1.30 - 64.83 ± 0.28 and roots: 6.29 ± 0.50–65.46 ± 0.31 mg kojic acid equivalent (KAE)/g), while modest inhibitory activity against α-amylase (0.08−0.61 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g) and α-glucosidase (0.09−0.83 mmol ACAE/g) for all the tested extracts. In addition, to provide the first scientific insight on the biological and chemical profile of S. tomentosa, observations from this present study tend to identify this plant as a valuable source of biologically active molecules for possible phytopharmaceutical and cosmeceuticals exploitation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The excessive expression of cholinesterases (ChEs) directly disturbs the metabolism of acetylcholine (ACh), causing disordering neurotransmission in the brain or even Alzheimer's disease and cancer. However, the variation of ChEs including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in brain glioma has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the development of a suitable method for in situ imaging ChEs in brain tissues to understand the physiological functions of ChEs in depth is very important. Herein, a new near-infrared emission fluorescent probe (IPAN) for visualization of ChE activity was developed. IPAN exhibits ultrafast response to ChEs, low detection limit for AChE (0.127 U/mL) and BChE (0.0117 U/mL), and a large Stokes shift with near-infrared emission. Based on these excellent attributes, the IPAN was effectively utilized for imaging the fluctuations of ChE activity in the apoptosis cells and zebrafish. Notably, by utilizing the unique probe IPAN, we observed a significant enhancement of ChE activity in the tumor cells and brain glioma, for the first time. We believe that this interesting finding could provide a powerful guidance for tumor resection in the future. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance: Paeonia suffruticosa Andr. has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as an anti-tumour, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent. Resveratrol oligomers are the main components of the seed coat extracts of Paeonia suffruticosa (PSCE) and have DPPH free radical scavenging and β-secretase inhibitory activity. However, studies of its effect on ameliorating cognitive deficits are limited, and analyses of the underlying mechanisms are insufficient. Aim of study: This study aimed to investigate the cholinesterase inhibitory activities of resveratrol oligomers from P. suffruticosa in vitro and their effects on diminishing the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) -induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells and scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms were further explored. Materials and methods: In vitro, the inhibitory effects of PSCE and its 10 stilbenes on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were evaluated using the Ellman's assay, and its protective effects on normal and OGD/R-injured PC12 cells were evaluated using the MTT assay. For the in vivo assay, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered with PSCE at doses of 150 and 600 mg/kg for 28 days, and injected with scopolamine (1.5 mg/kg) to induce cognitive deficits. The memory behaviours were evaluated using the novel object recognition, Morris water maze and inhibitory avoidance test. Levels of various biochemical markers were also examined, including AChE, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholine (ACh), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) in the mouse brain and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-4 (IL-4) in serum. Results: PSCE and its 10 stilbenes display good inhibition of AChE and BuChE activities and significantly increase the viability of normal and OGD/R-injured PC12 cells. PSCE improves the cognitive performance of scopolamine-treated mice in behavioural tests. Meanwhile, PSCE increases AChE, ChAT, SOD, and CAT activities and ACh, GSH, IL-4 levels, and decreases IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α levels in the model animals. Conclusions: Resveratrol oligomers from P. suffruticosa show neuroprotective effect in vitro and in vivo by regulating cholinergic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways, may have promising application in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, the synthesized compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, selenium and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds (1–6) were evaluated against the human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I, and II isoenzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and α-glycosidase enzymes. The synthesized heterocyclic compounds showed IC50 values in range of 33.32–60.79 nM against hCA I, and 37.05–66.64 nM against hCA II closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes. On the other hand, IC50 values were found in range of 13.13–22.21 nM against AChE, 0.54–31.22 nM against BChE, and 13.51–26.55 nM against α-glycosidase as a hydrolytic enzyme. As a result, nitrogen, phosphorus, selenium and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds (1–6) demonstrated potent inhibition profiles against indicated metabolic enzymes.

abstract={In this research, we have implemented two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) modeling using two different datasets, namely, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzyme inhibitors. A third dataset has been derived based on their selectivity and used for the development of partial least squares (PLS) based regression models. The developed models were extensively validated using various internal and external validation parameters. The features appearing in the model against AChE enzyme suggest that a small ring size, higher number of −CH2- groups, higher number of secondary aromatic amines and higher number of aromatic ketone groups may contribute to the inhibitory activity. The features obtained from the model against BuChE enzyme suggest that the sum of topological distances between two nitrogen atoms, higher number of fragments X-C(=X)-X, higher number of secondary aromatic amides, fragment R–CR-X may be more favorable for inhibition. The features obtained from selectivity based model suggest that the number of aromatic ethers, unsaturation content relative to the molecular size and molecular shape may be more specific for the inhibition of the AChE enzyme in comparison to the BuChE enzyme. Moreover, we have implemented the molecular docking studies using the most and least active molecules from the datasets in order to identify the binding pattern between ligand and target enzyme. The obtained information is then correlated with the essential structural features associated with the 2D-QSAR models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a biomarker in human blood. Aberrant BChE activity has been associated with human diseases. Here we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) chemical probe to specifically quantify BChE activity in serum, while simultaneously discriminating against glutathione (GSH). The FRET chemical probe 11 was synthesized from a key trifunctional bicyclononyne exo-6 and derivatives of 5-(2-aminoethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (EDANS) and 4-[4-(dimethylamino)phenylazo]benzoic acid (DABCYL). EDANS fluorescence visualization and kinetic analysis of 11 in the presence of diverse compounds confirmed the outstanding reactivity and specificity of 11 with thiols. The thiol-dependent fluorescence turn-on property of 11 was attributed to a general base-catalyzed SN2 nucleophilic substitution mechanism and independent of metal ions. Moreover, all thiols, except GSH, reacted swiftly with 11. Kinetic studies of 11 in the presence of covalently modified GSH derivatives corroborated that the steric hindrance of 11 imposing on GSH was the likely cause of the distinguished reactivity. Since GSH commonly interferes in assays measuring BChE activity in blood samples, the 11-based fluorescent assay was employed to directly quantify BChE activity without GSH interference, and delivered a linear range of 4.3–182.2 U L−1 for BChE activity with detection limit of 4.3 U L−1, and accurately quantified serum BChE activity in the presence of 10 μM GSH. Finally, the 11-based assay was exploited to determine Ki of 5 nM for tacrine inhibition on BChE catalysis. We are harnessing the modulated characteristics of 6 to synthesize advanced chemical probes able to more sensitively screen for BChE inhibitors and quantify BChE activity in serum. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={In the overall scenario of precision medicine, we propose a novel paper-based lab-on-a-chip to deliver a cost-effective and easy to use sensing tool for customized administration of drugs in Alzheimer's disease. Among several drugs, we designed the device for evaluating the efficacy of compounds (e.g. physostigmine, rivastigmine, donepezil) which are able to inhibit in a reversible way the cholinesterase enzyme. Because cholinesterase activity is peculiar to each patient, the administration of customized amount of the drug can improve the treatment efficacy and the quality of patient life, avoiding side effects due to the overdosage. In detail, we exploited Vivid™ Plasma Separation membrane to threat the whole blood sample, filter paper to load the reagents needed for the measurement, and office paper to print electrodes able to measure the butyrylcholinesterase activity, delivering a reagent free analytical tool. The calibration curve of butyrylcholinesterase obtained in blood sample provided linearity between 2 and 12 U/mL, with sensitivity of 0.050 ± 0.004 μA mL/U. The physostigmine, rivastigmine, and donepezil inhibition activities toward the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme were also measured in blood sample with linearity up to respectively 0.5 μM, 25 μM, 30 μM, and detection limits of 0.009 μM, 0.4 μM, 0.3 μM.

The geranylated compounds, cowanin (13), cowagarcinone E (15), norcowanin (16) and cowanol (17) exhibited potent inhibitions against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (IC50 0.33–1.09 μM) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (IC50 0.048–1.84 μM), which were more active than the reference drug, galanthamine. Compound 15 was highly potent BChE inhibitor (IC50 0.048 μM) and was 76-fold more potent than the drug. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the C-2 prenyl and C-8 geranyl substituents in the tetraoxygenated scaffold are important for high activity.

abstract={Biopharmaceutical protein production using transgenic plant cell bioreactor processes offers advantages over microbial and mammalian cell culture platforms in its ability to produce complex biologics with simple chemically defined media and reduced biosafety concerns. A disadvantage of plant cells from a traditional batch bioprocessing perspective is their slow growth rate which has motivated us to develop semicontinuous and/or perfusion processes. Although the economic benefits of plant cell culture bioprocesses are often mentioned in the literature, to our knowledge no rigorous technoeconomic models or analyses have been published. Here we present technoeconomic models in SuperPro Designer® for the large-scale production of recombinant butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a prophylactic/therapeutic bioscavenger against organophosphate nerve agent poisoning, in inducible transgenic rice cell suspension cultures. The base facility designed to produce 25 kg BChE per year utilizing two-stage semicontinuous bioreactor operation manufactures a single 400 mg dose of BChE for $263. Semicontinuous operation scenarios result in 4–11% reduction over traditional two-stage batch operation scenarios. In addition to providing a simulation tool that will be useful to the plant-made pharmaceutical community, the model also provides a computational framework that can be used for other semicontinuous or batch bioreactor-based processes. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Berberine, a naturally occurring compound, possesses an interesting multipotent pharmacological profile potentially applicable for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. In this study, a series of novel 22 berberine derivatives was developed and tested in vitro. Berberine core was substituted at position 9-O of its aromatic ring region. All the hybrids under the study revealed multi-targeted profile inhibiting prolyl oligopeptidase, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase highlighting 4a, 4g, 4j, 4l and 4s possessing balanced activities in the micromolar range. The top-ranked candidates in terms of the most pronounced potency against POP, AChE and BChE can be classified as 4d, 4u and 4v, bearing 4-methylbenzyl, (naphthalen-2-yl)methylene and 1-phenoxyethyl moieties, respectively. In vitro data were corroborated by detailed kinetic analysis of the selected lead molecules. 4d, 4u and 4v were also inspected for their potential to inhibit aggregation of two abberant proteins in AD, namely amyloid beta and tau, indicating their potential disease-modifying properties. To explain the results of our study, we carried out docking simulation to the active sites of the respective enzyme with the best berberine derivatives, along with QSAR study. We also investigated compounds’ potential permeability through blood-brain barrier by applying parallel artificial membrane permeation assay and addressed their cytotoxicity profile. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={New compounds containing thiazole and pyridinium moieties were designed and synthesized. The potency of the synthesized compounds as selective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and β-amyloid aggregation (Aβ) was evaluated. Compounds 7d and 7j showed the best AChE inhibitory activities at the submicromolar concentration range (IC50 values of 0.40 and 0.69 μM, respectively). Most of the novel compounds showed moderate to low inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which is indicative of their selective inhibitory effects towards AChE. Kinetic studies using the most potent compounds 7d and 7j confirmed a mixed-type of AChE inhibition mechanism in accordance with the docking results, which shows their interactions with both catalytic active (CAS) and peripheral anionic (PAS) sites. The specific binding of 7a, 7j, and 7m to PAS domain of AChE was also confirmed experimentally. In addition, 7d and 7j were able to show β-amyloid self-aggregation inhibitory effects (20.38 and 42.66% respectively) stronger than donepezil (14.70%) assayed at 10 μM concentration. Moreover, compounds 7j and 7m were shown to be effective neuroprotective agents in H2O2-induced oxidative stress on PC12 cells almost similar to those observed for donepezil. The ability of 7j to pass blood-brain barrier was demonstrated using the PAMPA method.

abstract={Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are extensively used worldwide as agrochemicals; however, excess use may threaten the health of humans. Thus, it is an urgent need to develop a sensitive method for determination of OPs. Herein, a simple and sensitive split-type electrochemical method was developed by using MnO2 nanoflower-electron mediator as a signal transduction element. The MnO2 nanoflower-electron mediator was synthesized and shows an excellent electrochemical signal attributed to the high specific surface area of MnO2 nanoflower. Meanwhile, the inhibition of OPs on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was carried out in the homogeneous system. In the absence of target molecule, a large number of thiocholines (TCh) were yielded from hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine (ATCh) by BChE. The MnO2 nanoflower was cracked, and subsequently, multiple electron mediator molecules were released from the platform after treated with TCh, thus decreasing the electrochemical response. Furthermore, the inhibition of OPs on BChE resulted in the reduced generation of TCh, thus inducing the recovery of electrochemical signal. Under the optimal experimental, dichlorvos can be detected in a wide range of 10−6–10−10 M, with a detection limit of 3 × 10−10 M. Moreover, the assay was successfully used to analyze dichlorvos in cucumber juice and pear juice, showing a great promising potential for detecting organophosphorus pesticides in complex samples.

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease is characterised by progressive mental deterioration, related to ageing and senility. Thirty methanol and ethyl acetate extracts from 15 native New Zealand trees and bushes were produced and tested for the inhibition of three enzymes related to neurotransmission: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and beta-secretase (BACE). In addition the IC50 for the antioxidant potential of the extracts was determined. Weinmannia racemosa and Kunzea ericoides were effective inhibitors of AChE-BChE and beta-secretase, respectively. The IC50 for W. racemosa extracts against AChE and BChE ranged between 8.09 μg/mL and 37.07 μg/mL. The ethyl acetate extract of Schefflera digitata was also an effective inhibitor of BChE (IC50 = 25.38 μg/mL). K. ericoides IC50 for beta-secretase were 29.05 μg/mL and 36.40 μg/ml. The highest radical scavenging activity (RSA) was detected in the methanol extract of Aristotelia serrata (IC50 = 2.34 μg/mL), followed by both extracts of Hebe stricta and W. racemosa, and last the methanol extracts of K. ericoides and Pomaderris kumeraho, which presented higher RSA than the reference antioxidant (IC50 &lt;12.0 μg/mL). W. racemosa showed inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE enzymes and antioxidant activity, which suggests these extracts may have potential for application in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. © 2020, © 2020 The Royal Society of New Zealand.},

abstract={Two types of cholinesterases (ChEs) are present in mammalian blood and tissues: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). While AChE regulates neurotransmission by hydrolyzing acetylcholine at the postsynaptic membranes and neuromuscular junctions, BChE in plasma has been suggested to be involved in detoxifying toxic compounds. This study was undertaken to establish the identity of circulating ChE activity in plasmas from domestic animals (bovine, ovine, caprine, porcine and equine) by assessing sensitivity to AChE-specific inhibitors (BW284c51 and edrophonium) and BChE-specific inhibitors (dibucaine, ethopropazine and Iso-OMPA) as well as binding to anti-FBS AChE monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Based on the inhibition of ChE activity by ChE-specific inhibitors, it was determined that bovine, ovine and caprine plasma predominantly contain AChE, while porcine and equine plasma contain BChE. Three of the anti-FBS AChE MAbs, 4E5, 5E8 and 6H9, inhibited 85–98% of enzyme activity in bovine, ovine and caprine plasma, confirming that the esterase in these plasmas was AChE. These MAbs did not bind to purified recombinant human or mouse AChE, demonstrating that these MAbs were specific for AChEs from ruminant species. These MAbs did not inhibit the activity of purified human BChE, or ChE activity in porcine and equine plasma, confirming that the ChE in these plasmas was BChE. Taken together, these results demonstrate that anti-FBS AChE MAbs can serve as useful tools for distinguishing between AChEs from ruminant and non-ruminant species and BChEs. © 2020},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the effect of osmotic dehydration (OD) using fruit concentrates (apple, pear, pineapple, sour cherry, blackcurrant, and chokeberry), before combined drying involving convective drying and vacuum-microwave finish drying, on the drying kinetics and physiochemical parameters (dry weight, water activity, content of l-ascorbic acid, sugars, organic acids, and phenolic compounds). Moreover, biological activities, including antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anticholinergic activities, of the dried Japanese quince fruit and osmotic fluids before and after osmotic dehydration have been assessed. The chokeberry concentrate reduced the final moisture ratio by half compared with the non-OD Japanese quince fruit, and the pineapple and sour cherry concentrates hindered the dehydration process during vacuum-microwave drying. OD significantly shortened the combined drying time compared with non-OD samples. The OD Japanese quince fruit was characterized by an increased content of sugars (up to 20 times more) and a significant reduction in the content of organic acids (even 77% reduction compared with non-OD fruit). Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of OD fruits decreased, but increased inhibition potential of α-amylase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase was observed. Osmotic fluids were also analyzed before and after the OD, and the following changes were found: reduction of sugars and increase of organic acid content, increase in phenolic content, antioxidant and antidiabetic potential, regardless of the concentrate used. To sum up, the osmotic dehydration process has the potential to modulate the chemical composition and biological properties of the Japanese quince fruit. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The aim of the study was to analyze potential health-promoting and nutritional components (polyphenols, L-ascorbic acid, carotenoids, chlorophylls, amino acids, organic acid, sugars, ash and pectins) of selected sprouts (radish, lentil, black medick, broccoli, sunflower, leek, beetroot, mung beans) and microgreens (kale, radish, beetroot, green peas, amaranth). Moreover, antioxidant capacity (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)), in vitro antidiabetic potential (inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase), and anti-obesity (pancreatic lipase) and anti-cholinergic (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) activity were evaluated. The results of this study show that sprouts are effective in antioxidant capacity as a result of a high content of polyphenols and L-ascorbic acid. Additionally, sprouts are better sources of amino acids, pectins and sugars than microgreens. Microgreens were characterized by high content of carotenoids and chlorophylls, and organic acid, without any sugars, exhibiting higher anti-diabetic and anti-cholinergic activity than sprouts. Some selected sprouts (broccoli, radish, lentil) and microgreens (radish, amaranths, kale) should be used daily as superfoods or functional food. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible and chronic neurological disorder that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills. The research study was designed to investigate the underlying molecular signaling involved in the neuroprotective effects of cyclopentanone derivative i.e., 2-(hydroxyl-(3-nitrophenyl)methyl)cyclopentanone (3NCP) as a therapeutic agent for AD. In this study, In vivo studies were carried out on a well-known 5xFAD mice model using different behavioural test models such as open field, rotarod, Morris water maze (MWM), and Y-maze tests. Furthermore, in vitro cholinesterase inhibition activity assays were carried out. The frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (HC) homogenates were tested for the levels/activities of cholinesterases, glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and catalase. Furthermore, the hippocampal expression of inflammatory cytokines was observed via RT-PCR and western blot. The results of in vivo studies show an enhancement in the learning behavior. The 3NCP treatment reduced latency time in MWM and Y-maze tests, also increase spontaneous alternation indicate significant effect of 3NCP on memory. Furthermore, open field and rotarod studies revealed that 3NCP does not cause motor coordination deficit. The results of the in vitro studies revealed that the IC50 values of the 3NCP against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were 16.17 and 20.51 µg/mL, respectively. This decline in AChE and BChE was further supported by ex vivo studies. Further, the 3NCP mitigates the GSH level, GST, and catalase activities in HC and FC. The mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) markedly declined in RT-PCR and western blotting. The results of the current study conclusively demonstrate that 3NCP reduces oxidative stress and mitigates neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice, implying that 3NCP may be a potential therapeutic candidate for AD treatment in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Fisch. & C.A.Mey. ex Hohen, Ferula rigidula Fisch. ex DC., Ferula orientalis L., Prangos ferulacea Lindl., Prangos peucedanifolia Fenzl., Ferulago setifolia K. Koch, and Pimpinella anthriscoides Boiss.) were evaluated. Species belonging to the Prangos genus exhibited the highest total phenolic content, namely P. peucedanifolia and P. ferulacea, with values of 47.90 and 44.44 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract, respectively. P. peucedanifolia also displayed the highest radical scavenging capacity (81.53 and 102.70 mg Trolox equivalent [TE]/g extract for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), respectively) and reducing power (165.87 and 100.09 mg TE/g extract for cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), respectively). C. macrospermum showed the most potent inhibition against Alzheimer's disease related enzymes, namely acetylcholinesterase (4.53 mg galantamine equivalent [GALAE]/g extract) and butyrylcholinesterase (3.22 mg GALAE/g extract). P. ferulacea (131.94 mg kojic acid (KAE) equivalent/g extract) and P. peucedanifolia (4.97 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g extract) were potent inhibitors of tyrosinase and α-glucosidase, respectively. In general, studied species were able to reduce cellular viabilities. P. peucedanifolia possessed promising antibacterial potential against Bacillus cereus (Minimum inhibition concentration (MIC): 0.37 mg/mL), L. monocytogenes (MIC: 0.56 mg/mL), P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli (MIC: 0.27 mg/mL), Salmonella typhimurium and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC: 0.75 mg/mL). F. rigidula showed the highest antifungal effect against Aspergillus ochraceus and Trichoderma viride (MIC: 0.10 mg/mL). The present findings could be the scientific starting point towards the pharmaceutical and/or commercial utilization of these Apiaceae species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Novel small molecules were synthesized in the quest to search for multi-target directed ligand for Alzheimer's disease. From the preliminary synthesis, ethyl 4-((cyclohexylmethyl)amino)-3-nitrobenzoate (2 h) showed good butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity. Modifications carried out on compound 2 h by removing the nitro group resulted in the identification of ethyl 4-((cyclohexylmethyl)amino)benzoate (3 h) as a selective and potent BChE inhibitor (IC50=0.735 μM; BChE selectivity&gt;100-fold over acetylcholinesterase (AChE)). Furthermore, compound 3 h was shown to be able to promote neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells. No significant cytotoxicity was exhibited by compound 3 h, up till the highest concentration tested (25 μM). The compound was also predicted to have good permeability across the lipid infused bilayer, indicating its potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results warrant further investigations on compound 3 h as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication after surgery and its occurrence is associated with poor outcomes. The neuropathology of this complication is unclear, but it is important to evaluate relevant biomarkers for postoperative status. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between expression levels of cholinergic biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the occurrence and development of POD in elderly patients. Methods: Four hundred and ninety-two elderly patients aged 65 years old or older with elective total hip/knee replacement received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. Preoperative baseline cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before surgery. Each patient was interviewed in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and on the first, second, third and seventh (or before discharge) postoperative days. POD was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and POD severity was measured using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Preoperative CSF and plasma choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were determined by ELISA. The levels of ChAT, AChE and BuChE activities were determined by spectrophotometry. Results: POD was detected in 11.4% (51/447) of the patients. AChE, BuChE, ChAT, TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations in CSF and plasma have higher consistency. In preoperative CSF and preoperative and postoperative plasma, down-regulation of the concentration and activity of AChE and BuChE as well as up-regulation of the concentration and activity of ChAT and the concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were observed in patients who developed POD, and the decrease in BuChE was the most obvious. Logistic analysis showed the activities of ChAT, AChE and BuChE in CSF were still related to POD after adjusting for related factors such as sex, age, years of education, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine the Area Under Curve (AUC) of AChE, BuChE and ChAT activity in CSF was 0.679 (P < 0.01), 0.940 (P < 0.01) and 0.819 (P < 0.01) respectively and found that BuChE activity had the most accurate diagnostic value. Conclusion: The changes in preoperative activity of AChE, BuChE and ChAT in CSF were associated with the development of POD in elderly patients, and BuChE activity had the greatest diagnostic value, which may be related to central cholinergic degradation. These cholinergic biomarkers might participate in the neuropathology of POD, pending further investigations. Trial registration: This study was registered at Chictr.org.cn (NO.

The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from Electrophorus electricus, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) from equine serum, α-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging properties of the compounds (3–6) were investigated using spectrophotometric method. The supercoiled plasmid pBR322 DNA hydrolytic nuclease effects of the compounds (3–6) were investigated on the agarose gel. The compound 5 showed the strongest AChE and BuChE inhibitory properties with IC50 values of 0.86 ± 0.01 and 20.46 ± 2.47 μM, respectively and the SI value of 5 was 23.79. Also, 5 showed the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory and DPPH radical scavenging actions with IC50 values of 25.12 ± 0.62 μM and 1.11 ± 0.02 μM, respectively. The compounds showed no hydrolytic nuclease effects at increasing concentrations against supercoiled plasmid DNA.

abstract={Organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNAs), used in chemical warfare, irreversibly inhibit essential cholinesterases (ChEs) in the cholinergic neurotransmission system. Several potent nucleophilic oximes have been approved for the treatment of acute poisoning by OPNAs, but they are rapidly cleared from blood circulation. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) stoichiometrically binds nerve agents, but because the molecular weight of a nerve agent is about 500-fold less than the enzyme, the bioscavenger has had limited utility. We synthesized BChE-polymer-oxime conjugates using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and azide-alkyne "click"chemistry. The activity of the BChE-polymer-oxime conjugates was dependent on the degree of oxime loading within the copolymer side chains. The covalent modification of oxime-containing copolymers prolonged the activity of BChE in the presence of the VX-and cyclosarin-fluorogenic analogues EMP-MeCyC and CMP-MeCyC, respectively. After complete inactivation by VX and cyclosarin fluorogenic analogues, the conjugates demonstrated efficient self-reactivation of up to 80% within 3-6 h. Repeated inhibition and high-level self-reactivation assays revealed that the BChE-polymer-oxime conjugates were excellent reactivators of OPNA-inhibited BChE. Recurring self-reactivation of BChE-polymer-oxime conjugates following repeated BChE inhibition by fluorogenic OPNAs (Flu-OPNAs) opens the door to developing the next generation of nerve agent "catalytic"bioscavengers.

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) efficiently hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh) at high concentrations when acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is substrate-inhibited. Recent studies have shown that BChE also has a function that is independent of ACh, but it has not been fully explored. Low BChE expression is accompanied with higher stress-induced aggression and ghrelin levels in stress models, and BChE knockout mice exhibit cognitive and memory impairments. However, the role of BChE in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of BChE in contextual fear memory and its regulatory effect on the expression of factors related to the glutamate (Glu)-glutamine (Gln) cycle via knockdown studies. We used AAVs and lentiviruses to knockdown BChE expression in the mouse hippocampal CA1 region and C8D1A astrocytes. Our behavioral data from those mice injected with AAV-shBChE in the hippocampal CA1 region showed strengthened fear memory and increased dendritic spine density. Elevated Glu levels and glutamine synthetase (GS) enzyme activity were detected in contextual fear conditioned-BChE knockdown animals and astrocytes. We observed that an AAV-shBChE induced lowering of BChE expression in the hippocampus CA1 region enhanced contextual fear memory expression and promoted the astrocytic Glu-Gln cycle but did not elevate ACh-hydrolyzing activity. This study provides new insight into the regulatory role of BChE in cognition and suggests potential target for stress-related psychiatric disorder such as PTSD where patients experience fear after exposure to severe life-threatening traumatic events. © Copyright © 2020 Chen, Lin, Tan, Chen, Su, Zhao, Tan and Tan.},

abstract={To discover novel BChE inhibitors, a hierarchical virtual screening protocol followed by biochemical evaluation was applied. The most potent compound 8012-9656 (eqBChE IC50 = 0.18 ± 0.03 μM, hBChE IC50 = 0.32 ± 0.07 μM) was purchased and synthesized. It inhibited BChE in a noncompetitive manner and could occupy the binding pocket forming diverse interactions with the target. 8012-9656 was proven to be safe in vivo and in vitro and showed comparable performance in ameliorating the scopolamine-induced cognition impairment to tacrine. Additionally, treatment with 8012-9656 could almost entirely recover the Aβ1-42 (icv)-impaired cognitive function to the normal level and showed better behavioral performance than donepezil. The evaluation of the Aβ1-42 total amount confirmed its anti-amyloidogenic profile. Moreover, 8012-9656 possessed blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrating ability, a long T1/2, and low intrinsic clearance. Hence, the novel potential BChE inhibitor 8012-9656 can be considered as a promising lead compound for further investigation of anti-AD agents. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease, but it should not be tackled alone rather together with other key targets to derive effective treatments. The combination of the scaffold of the polar antioxidant lead 7-methoxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-ol (CR-6) with that of the lipophilic cholinesterase inhibitor 6-chlorotacrine results in compounds with favorable brain permeability and multiple activities in vitro (acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), and Aβ42 and tau aggregation inhibition). In in vivo studies on wild-type and APP/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice, two selected compounds were well tolerated and led to positive trends, albeit statistically nonsignificant in some cases, on memory performance, amyloid pathology (reduced amyloid burden and potentiated non-amyloidogenic APP processing), and oxidative stress (reduced cortical oxidized proteins and increased antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), and heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) and transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)). These compounds emerge as interesting brain-permeable multitarget compounds, with a potential as anti-Alzheimer agents beyond that of the original lead CR-6.

abstract={The production and N-glycosylation of recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a model highly glycosylated therapeutic protein, in a transgenic rice cell suspension culture treated with kifunensine, a strong α-mannosidase I inhibitor, was studied in a 5 L bioreactor. A media exchange was performed at day 7 of cultivation by removing spent sugar-rich medium (NB+S) and adding fresh sugar-free (NB-S) medium to induce the rice α-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter to produce rice recombinant human BChE (rrBChE). Using a 1.25X-concentrated sugar-free medium together with an 80% reduced working volume during the media exchange led to a total active rrBChE production level of 79 ± 2 µg (g FW)−1 or 7.5 ± 0.4 mg L−1 in the presence of kifunensine, which was 1.5-times higher than our previous bioreactor runs using normal sugar-free (NB-S) media with no kifunensine treatment. Importantly, the amount of secreted active rrBChE in culture medium was enhanced in the presence of kifunensine, comprising 44% of the total active rrBChE at day 5 following induction. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot analyses revealed different electrophoretic migration of purified rrBChE bands with and without kifunensine treatment, which was attributed to different N-glycoforms. N-Glycosylation analysis showed substantially increased oligomannose glycans (Man5/6/7/8) in rrBChE treated with kifunensine compared to controls. However, the mass-transfer limitation of kifunensine was likely the major reason for incomplete inhibition of α-mannosidase I in this bioreactor study. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Eight compounds were isolated from the roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis and tested for cholinesterase (ChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activities. The coumarin glycyrol (GC) effectively inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with IC50 values of 7.22 and 14.77 µM, respectively, and also moderately inhibited MAO-B (29.48 µM). Six of the other seven compounds only weakly inhibited AChE and BChE, whereas liquiritin apioside moderately inhibited AChE (IC50 = 36.68 µM). Liquiritigenin (LG) potently inhibited MAO-B (IC50 = 0.098 µM) and MAO-A (IC50 = 0.27 µM), and liquiritin, a glycoside of LG, weakly inhibited MAO-B (&gt;40 µM). GC was a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of BChE with a Ki value of 4.47 µM, and LG was a reversible competitive inhibitor of MAO-B with a Ki value of 0.024 µM. Docking simulations showed that the binding affinity of GC for BChE (−7.8 kcal/mol) was greater than its affinity for AChE (−7.1 kcal/mol), and suggested that GC interacted with BChE at Thr284 and Val288 by hydrogen bonds (distances: 2.42 and 1.92 Å, respectively) beyond the ligand binding site of BChE, but that GC did not form hydrogen bond with AChE. The binding affinity of LG for MAO-B (−8.8 kcal/mol) was greater than its affinity for MAO-A (−7.9 kcal/mol). These findings suggest GC and LG should be considered promising compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease with multi-targeting activities. © 2020 by the authors.

The compounds possessed low activity against carboxylesterase, indicating a likely absence of unwanted drug-drug interactions in clinical use. Kinetics studies were consistent with mixed-type reversible inhibition of both cholinesterases. Molecular docking demonstrated dual binding sites of the conjugates in AChE and clarified the differences in the structure-activity relationships for AChE and BChE inhibition. The conjugates could bind to the AChE peripheral anionic site and displace propidium, indicating their potential to block AChE-induced β-amyloid aggregation, thereby exerting a disease-modifying effect. All compounds demonstrated low antioxidant activity. Computational ADMET profiles predicted that all compounds would have good intestinal absorption, medium blood-brain barrier permeability, and medium cardiac toxicity risk. Overall, the results indicate that the novel conjugates show promise for further development and optimization as multitarget anti-AD agents. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={A library of 14 mono-oxime quinuclidinium-based compounds with alkyl or benzyl substituent were synthesized and characterized in vitro as potential antidotes for organophosphorus compounds (OP) poisoning treatment. We evaluated their potency for reversible inhibition and reactivation of OP inhibited human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and evaluated interactions by molecular docking studies. The reactivation was notable for both AChE and BChE inhibited by VX, cyclosarin, sarin and paraoxon, if quinuclidinium compounds contained the benzyl group attached to the quinuclidinium moiety. Out of all 14, oxime Q8 [4-bromobenzyl-3-(hydroxyimino)quinuclidinium bromide] was singled out as having the highest determined overall reactivation rate of approximately 20,000 M−1 min−1 for cyclosarin-inhibited BChE. Furthermore, this oxime in combination with BChE exhibited a capability to act as a bioscavenger of cyclosarin, degrading within 2 h up to 100-fold excess of cyclosarin concentration over the enzyme. Molecular modeling revealed that the position of the cyclohexyl moiety conjugated with the active site serine of BChE directs the favorable positioning of the quinuclidinium ring and the bromophenyl moiety of Q8, which makes phosphonylated-serine easily accessible for the nucleophilic displacement by the oxime group of Q8. This result presents a novel scaffold for the development of new BChE-based bioscavengers. Furthermore, a cytotoxic effect was not observed for Q8, which also makes it promising for further in vivo reactivation studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this study, chemical composition and in vitro biological activities of artichoke by-products (leaves, floral stems and bracts) issued from two Tunisian varieties were evaluated. Analysis was performed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (LC/DAD/ESI-MS). Total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents as well as the antioxidant activity conducted by three complementary methods, DPPH, ABTS and FRAP tests, were performed for each sample. Enzyme inhibitory effects against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and α-amylase were also studied. Results showed that TPC and TFC varied according to variety as well as the plant part. Bracts presented the highest TPC values (10–15 mg GAE/g DW), while leaves were distinguished by the highest TFC values (52–58 mg EQ/g DW). In vitro assays showed that Violet d'Hyères bracts and Blanc d'Oran leaves present the most antioxidant activities (30.040 and 20.428 mgET/gDW, respectively, by the DPPH method). Leaves demonstrated the highest acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory effects. Moreover, all organs displayed a noticeable inhibition towards α-amylase. LC/DAD/MS analysis revealed that artichoke by-products are a potential source of biopharmaceuticals such as luteolin derivatives from leaves and mono/dicaffeoylquinic acids in the other parts. This research demonstrates that globe artichoke by-products, unexploited in our country, are a promising source of natural health promoting compounds with potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2020 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland},

Bacillus cereus was susceptible to the old leaves of cultivars McKenzie and Nero, whereas Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria innocua were not inhibited by any of the extracts. Growth of B. cereus was inhibited by cv. McKenzie, resulting in increased lag time, whereas Nero had both an inhibitory and an inactivation effect. Except for cv. Viking at harvest stage, the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of aronia leaf extracts were about 60–70 and 70–80%, respectively. Therefore, aronia leaf is a natural resource with a potentially potent antidementia effect, besides antibacterial activity. © 2020, The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology.},

In this series of synthesized compounds, the polymethylene chains were varied from having tetra- to hexamethylene chains, and secondary NH, tertiary ethylamino, and quaternary ammonium groups were introduced into the chains. The molecular modeling of the compounds indicated that they could function as dual binding site acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, binding to both the peripheral anionic site and active site. The data from in vitro experiments show that the most active compounds exhibit affinity toward acetylcholinesterase within a nanomolar range, with selectivity for acetylcholinesterase over butyrylcholinesterase reaching four orders of magnitude.

abstract={The dual inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and cholinesterases (ChEs) has recently egressed as a novel strategy for the management of neurodegeneration. In the present work, a library of 3-hydroxy-3-phenacyloxindole analogs was screened for FAAH and ChEs (acetylcholinesterase [AChE]/butyrylcholinesterase [BuChE]) inhibition. 1-Benzyl-3-hydroxy-3-(2′,4′-dibromophenacyl)oxindole (16), the most promising compound, showed a balanced multifunctional profile with FAAH (IC50 = 8.7 ± 0.3 nM, competitive and reversible), AChE (IC50 = 28 ± 3 nM, mixed and reversible), and BuChE (IC50 = 65 ± 8 nM, mixed and reversible) inhibition. The structure–activity relationship study predicted multifarious fundamental aspects crucial for the potency of these analogs. Furthermore, the structural geometry and rigidness bestowed by the oxindole moiety resulted in improved adherence of the compounds within the binding pockets of the target enzymes. Molecular docking studies of the docked conformations acknowledged numerous interactions for trenchant stabilization of inhibitor–enzyme complexes. Binding interaction and conformational alignment studies of stereoisomers of the lead inhibitors highlighted the importance of the (S)-stereochemistry at C-3 of the oxindole scaffold for potency and selectivity. Compound 16 also displayed an antioxidant potential surpassing that of ascorbic acid, and it was non-neurotoxic. In silico molecular and ADMET properties anticipated druglikeness of the test compounds for oral use. Thus, compound 16 emerged as a new and interesting multifaceted candidate that could further be explored for its potential multitargeted role in the discovery of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. © 2020 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft},

abstract={More frequent and widespread nerve agent attacks highlight the need for efficacious pre- and post-exposure organophosphate (OP) counter-measures to protect military and civilian populations. Because of critical targeting of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the CNS by OPs, a pre-treatment candidate for preventing/reducing poisoning will be a broadly acting molecule that scavenges OPs in blood before they reach their physiological targets. Prophylactic human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE), the leading pretreatment candidate, has been shown to protect against multiple LD50's of nerve agents in rodents, macaques, and minipigs. This review describes the development of a HuBChE bioscavenger pretreatment from early proof-of-concept studies to pre-clinical studies with the native injectable enzyme and the development of aerosolized forms of recombinant enzyme, which can be delivered by inhalation nebulizer devices, to effect protection against inhaled OP nerve agents and insecticides. Early animal studies utilized parenteral exposure. However, lungs are the portal of entry for most volatile OP vapors and represent the major means of OP intoxication. In this regard, pretreat-ment with 7.5 mg/kg of HuBChE by IM injection protected minipigs against lethal sarin vapor and prevented AChE inhibition in the blood. This is similar to the five-day protection in macaques by an aerosolized rHuBChE using a nebulizer against aerosolized paraoxon (estimated to be an 8 mg/kg estimated human dose). Importantly, lethal inhaled doses of OP may be smaller relative to the same dose delivered by injection, thus reducing the protective HuBChE dose, while a combination of HuBChE and post-exposure oxime may prolong protection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The detrimental effects of organophosphates (OPs) on human health are thought to be of systemic, i.e., irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at nerve synapses. However, several studies have shown that AChE inhibition alone cannot explain all the toxicological manifestations in prolonged exposure to OPs. The present study aimed to assess the status of antioxidants malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) (reduced), catalase, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in chronic OP-exposed groups from Cameroon and Pakistan. Molecular analysis of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) of glutathione transferases (GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1), catalase gene (CAT, rs7943316), sirtuin 1 gene (SIRT1, rs10823108), acetylcholinesterase gene (ACHE, rs2571598), and butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE, rs3495) were screened in the OP-exposed individuals to find the possible causative association with oxidative stress and toxicity. Cholinesterase and antioxidant activities were measured by colorimetric methods using a spectrophotometer. Salting-out method was employed for DNA extraction from blood followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for molecular analysis. Cholinergic enzymes were significantly decreased in OP-exposed groups. Catalase and SOD were decreased and MDA and FRAP were increased in OP-exposed groups compared to unexposed groups in both groups. GSH was decreased only in Pakistani OPs-exposed group. Molecular analysis of ACHE, BCHE, Catalase, GSTP1, and GSTM1 SNPs revealed a tentative association with their phenotypic expression that is level of antioxidant and cholinergic enzymes. The study concludes that chronic OPs exposure induces oxidative stress which is associated with the related SNP polymorphism. The toxicogenetics of understudied SNPs were examined for the first time to our understanding. The findings may lead to a newer area of investigation on OPs induced health issues and toxicogenetics. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Dementia is a neurological condition commonly correlated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and it is seen with many other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The restricted number of medications is not appropriate to offer enough relief to enhance the quality of life of patients suffering from this symptom; thus, all therapeutic choices should be carefully assessed. In this study, new thiazolylhydrazone derivatives (2a–2l) were designed and synthesized based on the cholinergic hypothesis. Their chemical structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS spectrometric techniques. The ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) parameters of the synthesized compounds were predicted by using QikProp 4.8 software. It was concluded that all compounds presented satisfactory drug-like characteristics. Furthermore, their inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in vitro were also tested by modified the Ellman spectrophotometric method. According to the results, all compounds showed a weak inhibitory effect on BChE. On the other hand, most of the compounds (2a, 2b, 2d, 2e, 2g, 2i, and 2j) had a certain AChE inhibitory activity, and the IC50 values of them were calculated as 0.063 ± 0.003, 0.056 ± 0.002, 0.147 ± 0.006, 0.040 ± 0.001, 0.031 ± 0.001, 0.028 ± 0.001, and 0.138 ± 0.005 µM, respectively. Among these derivatives, compound 2i was found to be the most active agent in the series with an IC50 value of 0.028 ± 0.001 µM, which indicated an inhibition profile at a similar rate as the reference drug, donepezil. The potential binding modes of compounds 2a, 2b, 2e, 2g, and 2i with AChE were investigated and compared with each other by the molecular docking studies. The results showed that these compounds were strongly bound up with the AChE enzyme active site with the optimal conformations. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

For these reasons, this species has a high potential for food and pharmaceutical industries. Practical applications: This new GC–MS method was applied to S. hypargeia Fisch. & C.A. Mey. and it indicated that this species possessed high amount of ferruginol and lupeol, and that this species could be used for their natural sources. According to the results of the activity studies (antioxidant, anticholinesterase, tyrosinase, elastase, and cytotoxic), this method was used to exhibit which compound may be responsible for the activities. This developed and validated method could be easily applied to determine major/active/toxic secondary metabolites of Salvia species which are used and/or could be used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION: Aircraft maintenance workers may be exposed to organophosphates in hydraulic fluid and engine oil. Previous research has indicated that inhalation may not be the primary exposure route. This study sought to measure dermal contact and inhalation in conjunction with cholinesterase inhibition and determine if Air Force Specialty Code serves as an exposure predictor. METHODS: Aircraft maintenance workers were sampled for changes in acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Dermal contact was measured using wrist-worn silicone passive dosimeters and inhalation exposure was measured using thermal desorption tube air sampling. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of any cholinesterase inhibition in the study population was 25.33%. Prevalence of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase was 18.67% and 6.67%, respectively. The mean tributyl phosphate result was 1.71 ng of tributyl phosphate per gram of wristband (ng · g-1) [95% confidence interval (CI): 25.63, 9.05]. Triphenyl phosphate was more prevalent, with only one sample below the limit of detection (mean 1386.26 ng · g-1; 95% CI: 27297.78, 10,070.31), and tricresyl phosphate was found in every sample (mean 4311.65 ng · g-1; 95% CI: 28890.24, 17,512.31). No organophosphates were detected via air sampling. DISCUSSION: Workers experienced organophosphate exposure and cholinesterase inhibition, but the study was not large enough to establish a statistically significant association between exposure and disease. Exposure to organophosphate esters is more likely to occur through contact and absorption of chemicals through the skin than through inhalation of oil mists. Air Force Specialty Code does not appear to be a good predictor of exposure to organophosphates. Future studies should consider using a larger sample size. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.},

abstract={As ferulic acid was reported to be involved in novel potential mechanisms associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) therapy, five closely related phenethyl esters and amide of this natural product were synthesized and screened for their free radicals scavenging activity. Ferulic acid and its analogue’s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties were predicted. All compounds obey Lipinski’s rules. Moreover, all evaluated compounds seem to present a high oral bioavailability and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeation which is crucial for Alzheimer’s disease drug candidates. Molecular docking of analogues 4 and 8 with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) showed interactions with the residues of the catalytic triad of AChE and BChE. In addition to their interactions with the anionic subsite, hydroferulic acid phenethyl ester 4 and homovanillic acid phenethyl ester 8 may have potential as inhibitors of AChE and BChE, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={A novel Ni(II) complex containing 2-fluorobenzoate and 3-hydroxypyridine ligands was synthesized and characterized using elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. FT-IR peaks show that the carboxylate group from 2-fluorobenzoate has a monodentate coordination mode. The coordination environment around the Ni2+ ion is of distorted octahedral geometry. The octahedral geometry consists of a total of four oxygen atoms from two carboxylate groups of two fluorobenzoate anions, two water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two 3-hydroxypyridine ligands. The complex shows excellent inhibitory effects against some metabolic enzymes. Ki values for the complex were found as 108.17 ± 25.63, 124.88 ± 36.20, 28.11 ± 2.87, 20.95 ± 5.65 and 32.63 ± 9.67 μM against human carbonic anhydrase I, human carbonic anhydrase II, α-glycosidase, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively.

abstract={Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible chronic neurodegenerative disease which is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. According to amyloid hypothesis, cholin neurotransmitters have important roles in CNS memory function, therefore cholinesterase inhibitors can improve the Alzheimer's symptoms. In recent decades, marine creatures have become interested for their huge medicinal effects and potential of pharmaceutical preparations. Marine classifications contain pharmacologically active compounds with capibilities for improvement of cognitive disorders. This article provides a comprehensive overview of cholinesterase inhibitors from marines in 4 categories contain seaweeds, marine sponges, coelenterates and other invertebrates over the 47 years from 1970 to 2017 which resulted into important bioactive extracts and isolated compounds which representing a diverse range of structural classes such as pyrrole derivatives, sesquiterpene acetates, tetrazacyclopentazulene, bromotyrosine derivatives, plastoquinones, farnesylacetones and poly-alkylpyridinium polymers (Poly-APS). For each structural group, the important compounds with cholinesterase inhibition activities were introduced.

abstract={This review proposes the hypothesis that the effectiveness of irinotecan chemotherapy might be impaired by high doses of concomitantly administered Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The most important features shared by irinotecan and THC, which might represent sources of potentially harmful interactions are: first-pass hepatic metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP3A4; glucuronidation mediated by uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, isoforms 1A1 and 1A9; transport of parent compounds and their metabolites via canalicular ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2; enterohepatic recirculation of both parent compounds, which leads to an extended duration of their pharmacological effects; possible competition for binding to albumin; butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition by THC, which might impair the conversion of parent irinotecan into the SN-38 metabolite; mutual effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of oxidative stress; potentiation of hepatotoxicity; potentiation of genotoxicity and cytogenetic effects leading to genome instability; possible neurotoxicity; and effects on bilirubin. The controversies associated with the use of highly concentrated THC preparations with irinotecan chemotherapy are also discussed. Despite all of the limitations, the body of evidence provided here could be considered relevant for human-risk assessments and calls for concern in cases when irinotecan chemotherapy is accompanied by preparations rich in THC. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Essential oils from different plant species have been reported to possess various biological activities. Thus, this study is aimed at investigating the antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase properties of essential oils from ripe and unripe pepper fruits (Dennettia tripetala G. Baker). Essential oil was extracted from ripe and unripe pepper fruits (100 g each) using a Clevenger apparatus. Thereafter, the antioxidant activities of the essential oil were assessed through several antioxidant assays. In addition, the effect of the essential oil on cholinesterases; acetycholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was assessed using spectrophotometric method. The results revealed that both ripe and unripe pepper fruits essential oils showed strong antioxidant activities and there was no significant difference in their antioxidant activities except for ferric reducing antioxidant power where unripe pepper fruit essential oil showed higher antioxidant activity (16.33 mgAAE/g) than ripe pepper fruit essential oil (12.55 mgAAE/g). In addition, unripe pepper fruit essential oil had a stronger inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50 = 1.67 mg/mL) than that of ripe pepper fruit (IC50 = 2.69 mg/mL), whereas there was no significant difference in their BChE inhibitory properties. Essential oils from both ripe and unripe pepper fruits had antioxidant properties and inhibited AChE and BChE activities in vitro. However, findings in this study revealed that ripening could reduce the biological activities of pepper fruit essential oils, most especially ferric reducing antioxidant property and acetylcholinesterase inhibition. © 2020 the authors.},

abstract={This study aims to evaluate the circadian and circannual variations in a panel of analytes in horse saliva that have been previously described as biomarkers related to stress and disease, in order to interpret them correctly when they are measured in this species. This panel of analytes integrated cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), lipase (Lip), total esterase (TEA), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), adenosine deaminase (ADA), γ-glutamyl transferase (gGT), creatine kinase (CK), urea, total bilirubin, total protein (TP), and phosphorus. These analytes were measured in saliva obtained from a population of five clinically healthy mares from 06:30 to 20:30, every 2 h over two consecutive days in two different photoperiod seasons, winter and spring. The temperature and relative humidity did not change between the two consecutive days sampled in each sampled season, and no thermal discomfort was observed. Changes throughout the course of the day were observed for cortisol, sAA, TEA, BChE, ADA, and CK. However, a circadian pattern was only observed for cortisol, TEA, BChE, ADA, and CK. Moreover, the values obtained for sAA, Lip, and BChE were significantly different between seasons, with different daily rhythms for cortisol, TEA, BChE, and ADA depending on the season. In conclusion, this pilot study indicates that the time of the day and the season influence salivary analytes in horses, showing a rhythmic pattern for cortisol, TEA, BChE, ADA, and CK. These factors should thus be taken into consideration for the interpretation of analytes in horse saliva. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Ulva australis Areschoug (Ulvales, Chlorophyta) is traditionally used as a foodstuff in Korea and to treat several diseases, such as hyperlipidemia and urinary ailments. It is now considered an invasive species of the Venice Lagoon (Italy). This work explored U. australis as a potential source of bioactive molecules with biotechnological applications. For that purpose, organic and water extracts were prepared from dried biomass of U. australis and evaluated for radical scavenging activity (RSA), metal chelating activities and for in vitro inhibition of enzymes related with several disorders, namely Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase), obesity (lipase), Type-2 diabetes mellitus (α-glucosidase, α-amylase) and skin sagging (elastase). Extracts were also evaluated for total contents of phenolics, flavonoids condensed tannins and carbohydrates. Finally, the fatty acids methyl esters profile of the biomass was established by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Extracts had low to moderate radical scavenging activity on DPPH, and a higher ability to chelate Fe2+ than Cu2+, and the maximum Fe2+ chelating capacity was observed in the tincture (IC50 = 4.82 mg/mL). Samples had a higher ability to inhibit α-amylase and microbial α-glucosidase than the other tested enzymes. The biomass of U. australis presented a highly saturated fatty acids profile, enriched in palmitic acid. These data suggest U. australis as a promising source of natural products with anti- diabetic properties and as a desirable species for biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Gongronema latifolium (G. latifolium) Benth. leaves are traditionally used to treat diabetes mellitus (DM) and other diseases in Nigeria and West Africa. This study was performed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of aqueous extract of G. latifolium leaf against DM. Antidiabetic activity of G. latifolium extracts (6.36, 12.72 and 25.44 mg kg−1, i.p.) was determined in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Fasting blood glucose level and oxidative stress markers catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured. Cognitive biomarkers acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), dopamine (DOPA), serotonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) were measured in the brain of controls and of G. latifolium-treated diabetic rats. RESULTS: Administration of G. latifolium leaf extract to diabetic rats significantly restored the alterations in the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG). The MDA and NO levels were significantly reduced with an improvement in CAT, SOD, and GPx activity in the kidneys and brains of diabetic rats treated with G. latifolium. Gongronema latifolium also significantly decreased the levels of AChE, BChE, DOPA, serotonin, epinephrine, and nor-epinephrine in diabetic rats. G. latifolium effectively ameliorated COX-2 in diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: This study showed that leaf extract of G. latifolium improved antioxidant defense against oxidative stress. It displays a neuroprotective effect resulting in the modulation of brain neurotransmitters, which could be considered as a promising treatment therapy. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Some biochemical properties including phenolic content, anticholinergic, antidiabetic, and antioxidant activities of Stachys annua were determined in this study. The methanol extract of Stachys annua (MESA) and the water extract of Stachys annua (WESA) were prepared and used for all biochemical analyses. Antioxidant capacities of MESA and WESA were evaluated by six different in vitro bioanalytical methods including three reducing antioxidant methods and three radical scavenging antioxidant methods. Also, enzyme inhibition effect of Stachys annua against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-amylase, and α-glycosidase enzymes were determined separately. According to the results, both extracts showed high inhibition effects against α-amylase and α-glycosidase enzymes, whereas they showed low inhibition effects against AChE and BChE enzymes. The IC50 values of MESA and WESA against AChE (119.8 ± 2.4 μg/mL and 150.1 ± 3.0 μg/mL), BChE (192.1 ± 3.8 μg/mL and 186.7 ± 3.7 μg/mL), α-glycosidase (25.7 ± 0.5 μg/mL and 18.7 ± 0.4 μg/mL), and α-amylase (43.3 ± 0.9 μg/mL and 11.4 ± 0.2 μg/mL) were determined, respectively. Another goal of the study was to evaluate the phenolic compositions of Stachys annua by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Quercetagetin-3,6-dimethylether (178.6 ± 33.5 μg/g), chlorogenic acid (118.2 ± 16.4 μg/g), and fumaric acid (102.5 ± 7.1 μg/g) were identified as major compounds in MESA. On the other hand, fumaric acid (309.5 ± 21.5 μg/g), apigenin (144.6 ± 11.7 μg/g), and chlorogenic acid (78.1 ± 10.8 μg/g) were identified as major compounds in WESA.

abstract={Kadsura spp. in the Schisandraceae family are woody vine plants, which produce edible red fruits that are rich in nutrients and antioxidant activities. Despite their valuable food applications, Kadsura spp. are only able to grow naturally in the forest, and reproduction handled by botanists is still in progress with a very low growth rate. Subsequently, Kadsura spp. were listed as endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in 2011. Two different Kadsura spp., including Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A.C. Sm. and Kadsura heteroclita (Roxb.) Craib, are mostly found in northern Thailand. These rare, wild fruits are unrecognizable to outsiders, and there have only been limited investigations into its biological properties. This study, therefore, aimed to comparatively investigate the phenolic profiles, antioxidant activities, and inhibitory activities against the key enzymes involved in diabetes (α-glucosidase and α-amylase) and Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1)) in different fruit parts (exocarp, mesocarp (edible part), seed, and core) of Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A.C. Sm. and Kadsura heteroclita (Roxb.) Craib. The results suggested that Kadsura spp. extracts were rich in flavonol (quercetin), flavanone (naringenin), anthocyanidins (cyanidin and delphinidin), and anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (kuromanin), cyanidin 3-O-galactoside (ideain), cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside (keracyanin), and cyanidin 3,5-di-O-glucoside (cyanin)). These flavonoids were found to be responsible for the high antioxidant activities and key enzyme inhibitions detected in Kadsura spp. extracts. The findings of the present study can support further development of Kadsura spp. as a potential source of phenolics and anti-oxidative agents with health benefits against diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Besides, exocarp and the core of Kadsura spp. exhibited higher phenolic contents, antioxidant activities, and key enzyme inhibitory activities compared to the mesocarp and seeds, respectively. This information can promote the use of fruit parts other than the edible mesocarp for future food applications using Kadsura spp. rather than these being wasted. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The present study was aimed at assessing the in silico cholinergic activity of bioactive compounds from Citrus sinensis peel on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The six identified potential inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase from Citrus sinensis peel were retrieved from Pubchem database. The evaluation of their molecular docking score and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) – toxicity prediction of the six identified bioactive compounds was carried out with butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase using different bioinformatics tools. All the six compounds have a higher binding docking score than the standard used with rutin having the highest score. However, only quercetin, quercitrin and luteolin have the best ADME results and compete favorably with the standards and coligand used. Therefore, this study suggests that quercetin, quercitrin, and luteolin might be a promising therapeutic agent in the management of both T2DM and AD, even more, better than all standards used. © 2020, SILAE (Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine).

abstract={Cocaine use disorders include short-term and acute pathologies (e.g. overdose) and long-term and chronic disorders (e.g. intractable addiction and post-abstinence relapse). There is currently no available treatment that can effectively reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cocaine overdose or that can effectively prevent relapse in recovering addicts. One recently developed approach to treat these problems is the use of enzymes that rapidly break down the active cocaine molecule into inactive metabolites. In particular, rational design and site-directed mutagenesis transformed human serum recombinant butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) into a highly efficient cocaine hydrolase with drastically improved catalytic efficiency toward (−)-cocaine. A current drawback preventing the clinical application of this promising enzyme-based therapy is the lack of a cost-effective production strategy that is also flexible enough to rapidly scale-up in response to continuous improvements in enzyme design. Plant-based expression systems provide a unique solution as this platform is designed for fast scalability, low cost and the advantage of performing eukaryotic protein modifications such as glycosylation. A Plant-derived form of the Cocaine Super Hydrolase (A199S/F227A/S287G/A328W/Y332G) we designate PCocSH protects mice from cocaine overdose, counters the lethal effects of acute cocaine overdose, and prevents reinstatement of extinguished drug-seeking behavior in mice that underwent place conditioning with cocaine. These results demonstrate that the novel PCocSH enzyme may well serve as an effective therapeutic for cocaine use disorders in a clinical setting. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a non-specific enzyme with clinical pharmacological and toxicological significance, which was a renewed interest as therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD) nowadays. Here, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of butyrylcholinesterase with tacrine complex were designed to characterize inhibitor binding modes, strengths, and the hydrogen-bond dependent non-covalent release mechanism. Four possible release channels were identified, and the most favorable channel was determined by random acceleration molecular dynamics molecular dynamics (RAMD MD) simulations. The thermodynamic and dynamic properties as well as the corresponding Detour-forward delivery mechanism were determined according to the classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations accompanied with umbrella sampling. The free energy barrier of the tacrine release process for the most beneficial pathway is about 10.95 kcal/mol, which is related to the non-covalent interactions from the surrounding residues, revealing the specific binding characteristics in the active site. The residues including Asp70, Ser79, Trp82, Gly116, Thr120, Tyr332, and His438 were identified to play major roles in the stabilization of tacrine in the pocket of BChE, where hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions are significant factors. Tyr332 and Asp70, which act as gate keepers, play crucial roles in the substrate delivery. The present results provide a basic understanding for the ligand transport mechanism depending on the BChE enzymatic environment, which is useful for the design of BChE inhibitors in the future. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Fan, Luo, Zhao and Wang.},

abstract={As simple analogues of the natural compound chelerythrine, a novel anti-cholinesterase 2-phenylisoquinolin-2-ium scaffold was designed by structure imitation. The activity evaluation led to the discovery of seven compounds with potent anti-acetylcholinesterase activity with IC50 values of ≤0.72 μM, superior to chelerythrine and standard drugs galantamine. Particularly, compound 8y showed the excellent dual acetylcholinesterase-butyrylcholinesterase inhibition activity, superior to rivastigmine, a dual cholinesterase inhibitor drug. Furthermore, the compounds displayed a competitive anti-acetylcholinesterase mechanism with the substrate and low cytotoxicity. Molecular docking showed that the isoquinoline moiety is embedded in a cavity surrounded by four aromatic residues of acetylcholinesterase by the π-π action. Structure-activity relationship showed that the p-substituents on the C-ring can dramatically improve the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, while 8-OMe can increase the activity against the two cholinesterases simultaneously. Thus, the title compounds emerged as promising lead compounds for the development of novel cholinesterase inhibitor agents. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity is an important index for a variety of diseases. In this work, a "turn-on"assay is proposed based on controlling the inner filter effect (IFE) of MnO2 nanosheets (NSs) on sulfur nanodots (S-dots). The fluorescence of S-dots is effectively quenched by the MnO2 NSs, due to the wide overlap of the emission spectrum of S-dots and absorption spectrum of MnO2 NSs, together with the superior light absorption capability of MnO2 NSs. BChE can catalyze acetylthiocholine and produce thiocholine, which effectively decomposes the MnO2 NSs into Mn2+, resulting in the disappearance of the IFE and recovery of fluorescence of S-dots. Two-stage linear relationships between the ratio of fluorescence intensity and concentration of BChE are observed from 0.05 to 10 and from 10 to 500 U L-1. A limit of detection of 0.035 U L-1 is achieved, which is the best performance so far. The as-proposed assay is robust enough for practical detection in human serum, and it can avoid interference from its sister enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) and glutathione at the micromolar level. The presented results provide a clue for the functionalization of S-dots, and offer a powerful tool as an analytic technique for nanomedicine and environmental science.

abstract={The increasing number of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cases requires the development of new improved drug candidates, possessing the ability of more efficient treatment as well as less unwanted side effects. Cholinesterase enzymes are highly associated with the development of AD and thus represent important druggable targets. Therefore, we have synthesized eight organoruthenium(II) chlorido complexes 1a–h with pyrithione-type ligands (pyrithione = 1-hydroxypyridine-2(1H)-thione, a), bearing either pyrithione a, its methyl (b-e) or bicyclic aromatic analogues (f–h) and tested them for their inhibition towards electric eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE) and horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (hsBuChE). The experimental results have shown that the novel complex 1g with the ligand 1-hydroxyquinoline-2-(1H)-thione (g) improves the inhibition towards eeAChE (IC50 = 4.9 µM) and even more potently towards hsBuChE (IC50 = 0.2 µM) in comparison with the referenced 1a. Moreover, computational studies on Torpedo californica AChE have supported the experimental outcomes for 1g, possessing the lowest energy value among all tested complexes and have also predicted several interactions of 1g with the target protein. Consequently, we have shown that the aromatic ring extension of the ligand a, though only at the appropriate position, is a viable strategy to enhance the activity against cholinesterases. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={A photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensing platform is devised for sensitive detection of an organophosphorus pesticide based on dissolution of core-shell MnO2 nanoflower@CdS (MnO2 NF@CdS) by thiocholine (TCh). TCH is produced from the butyrylcholinesterase-acetylthiocholine system, accompanied by target-triggered rolling circle amplification (RCA). The core-shell MnO2 NF@CdS with excellent PEC performance was synthesized and employed as a photo-sensing platform. The target was detected on a functionalized magnetic probe with the corresponding aptamer. Upon malathion introduction, the aptamer was detached from the magnetic beads, while capture DNA (cDNA, with primer fragment) remained on the beads. The primer fragment in cDNA can trigger the RCA reaction to form a long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Furthermore, a large number of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were assembled on the long ssDNA strands through the hybridization with the S2-Au-BChE probe. Thereafter, TCh generated from hydrolysis of ATCh by BChE can reduce MnO2 NF (core) to Mn2+ and release the CdS nanoparticles (shell) from the platform electrode, significantly enhancing the PEC signal. Under optimal conditions, the proposed aptasensor exhibited high sensitivity for malathion with a low detection limit of 0.68 pg mL−1. Meanwhile, it also presents outstanding specificity, reproducibility, and stability. Importantly, the sensing platform provides a new concept for detection of pesticide.

The structural characterization of these novel substituted benzo[b]xanthenes was performed by spectroscopic methods, and their inhibitory actions against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were investigated. GST is an enzyme responsible for removing toxic molecules during Phase II reactions in the detoxification mechanism. The AChE and BChE enzymes, which are called cholinesterases, are among the enzymes that occur especially during dementia such as brain damage or Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition effects of the benzo[b]xanthene derivatives on AChE, BChE, and GST were found at the millimolar level. The best inhibitor for GST is compound 4a (31.18 ± 6.13 mM), for AChE, it is compound 4d (28.16 ± 3.46 mM), and for BChE, it is compound 4f (36.24 ± 3.19 mM). Compound 4a inhibited the dimerization of GST subunits, and compounds 4d and 4f directly inhibited the catalytic activity by interacting with the catalytic active site or a related site of the AChE and BChE enzymes, respectively. © 2020 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft},

abstract={Greigia sphacelata (Ruiz and Pav.) Regel (Bromeliaceae) is a Chilean endemic plant popularly known as “quiscal” and produces an edible fruit consumed by the local Mapuche communities named as “chupón”. In this study, several metabolites including phenolic acids, organic acids, sugar derivatives, catechins, proanthocyanidins, fatty acids, iridoids, coumarins, benzophenone, flavonoids, and terpenes were identified in G. sphacelata fruits using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection coupled with a Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-PDA-Orbitrap-MS) analysis for the first time. The fruits showed moderate antioxidant capacities (i.e., 487.11 ± 26.22 µmol TE/g dry weight) in the stable radical DPPH assay, 169.08 ± 9.81 TE/g dry weight in the ferric reducing power assay, 190.32 ± 6.23 TE/g dry weight in the ABTS assay, and 76.46 ± 3.18% inhibition in the superoxide anion scavenging assay. The cholinesterase inhibitory potential was evaluated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). From the findings, promising results were observed for pulp and seeds. Our findings suggest that G. sphacelata fruits are a rich source of diverse secondary metabolites with antioxidant capacities. In addition, the inhibitory effects against AChE and BChE suggest that natural products or food supplements derived from G. sphacelata fruits are of interest for their neuroprotective potential. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) has long been used as a food source and ingredient for traditional herbal remedies. Plant parts contain neuroprotective agents that interact with specific targets to inhibit Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Organic solvents including methanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, and n-butanol, are widely employed for extraction of sacred lotus but impact food safety. Seed embryo, flower stalk, stamen, old leaf, petal, and leaf stalk of sacred lotus were extracted using hot water (aqueous extraction). The extractions were analyzed for their bioactive constituents, antioxidant and anti-AD properties as key enzyme inhibitory activities toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and β-secretase 1 (BACE-1). Results showed that the sacred lotus stamen exhibited significant amounts of phenolics, including phenolic acids and flavonoids, that contributed to high antioxidant activity via both single electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms, with anti-AChE, anti-BChE, and anti-BACE-1 activities. To enhance utilization of other sacred lotus parts, a combination of stamen, old leaf and petal as the three sacred lotus plant components with the highest phenolic contents, antioxidant activities, and enzyme inhibitory properties was analyzed. Antagonist interaction was observed, possibly from flavonoids–flavonoids interaction. Further in-depth elucidation of this issue is required. Findings demonstrated that an aqueous extract of the stamen has potential for application as a functional food to mitigate the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={In this study, a series of A-ring azepano- and 3-amino-3,4-seco-derivatives were synthesized from betulin, oleanolic, ursolic and glycyrrhetinic acids aiming to develop new cholinesterase inhibitors. Azepanobetulin, azepanoerythrodiol and azepanouvaol were modified to give amide and tosyl derivatives, while azepano-anhydrobetulines and azepano-glycyrrhetols were obtained for the first time. Oleanane and ursane type 3-amino-3,4-seco-4(23)-en triterpenic alcohols were synthesized by reducing the corresponding 2-cyano-derivatives accessible from Beckmann type 2 rearrangements. The compounds were screened in colorimetric Ellman's assays to determine their ability to act as inhibitors for the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE, from electric eel) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, from equine serum). While most of these compounds were only moderate inhibitors for AChE, several of them were shown to be inhibitors for BChE acting as mixed-type inhibitors. Azepanobetulin 1, its C28-amide derivatives 7 and 8, azepano-11-deoxo-glycyrrhetol 12 and azepanouvaol 18 held inhibition constants Ki ranging between 0.21 ± 0.06 to 0.68 ± 0.19 μM. Thus, they were approximately 4 to 10 times more active than standard galantamine hydrobromide. For all of the compounds reasonably high docking scores for BChE were obtained being in good agreement with the experimental results from the enzymatic studies. As a result, A-ring azepano-triterpenoids were found to be new scaffolds for the development of BChE inhibitors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objectives: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders and a well-recognized cause of dementia with ageing. In this review, we have represented the ChE and MAO inhibitory potential of TV 3326 against AD based on current scientific evidence. Key findings: The aetiology of AD is quite complex and not completely understood. However, it has been observed that AD involves the deposition of abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ), along with hyperphosphorylation of tau, oxidative stress, low acetylcholine (ACh) level and biometal dyshomeostasis. Due to the complex nature of AD aetiology, active research is required in the areas of development of multitarget drugs with 2 or more complementary biological functions, as they might represent significant progress in the AD treatment. Interestingly, it has been found that TV 3326 (i.e. ladostigil) is regarded as a novel therapeutic agent since it has the potential to cause inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in the brain. Furthermore, it has the capacity to reverse memory impairments, which further suggests the ability of this drug to elevate cholinergic activity in the brain. Summary: TV 3326 can avert oxidative–nitrative stress and gliosis. It has also been confirmed that TV 3326 contains neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties. Therefore, this distinctive combined inhibition of ChE and MAO along with its neuroprotective property makes TV 3326 a useful drug in the treatment of AD. © 2020 Royal Pharmaceutical Society},

abstract={Extraction solvent is a very important factor in the recovery of antioxidants from natural matrices. In this study, the effect of three solvents (ethanol, ethanol/water and water) on the phenolic composition, antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase activities and electrochemical behaviour of four winemaking byproducts (seeds, skins, stems, and pomace) was evaluated. Phenolic composition was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC), antioxidant activity by the capacity to scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and hydroxyl radicals, anti-cholinesterase activity by the Ellman’s method, and electrochemical behaviour by cyclic voltammetry. Eight phenolic compounds were quantified with higher content in water/ethanol extracts (e.g., epicatechin in pomace: 17 mg/100 g vs. 7 and 6 mg/100 g in ethanol and water extracts, respectively), although there were some exceptions (e.g., gallic acid in seeds was most abundant in water extracts). Moreover, the highest total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity were found in ethanol/water extracts (between 2 and 30-fold the values of the other extracts). Overall, the most active extracts in inhibiting both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes were ethanol/water and ethanol extracts from seeds (between 31.11 and 53.90%). The electrochemical behaviour allowed for differentiating the extracts depending on the solvent and the byproduct. Our findings indicate that winemaking byproducts represent a source of phenolic compounds with antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase activities and suggest that cyclic voltammetry is a promising technique to evaluate the phenolic extraction process from these byproducts. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={This study aims to compare the anti-diabetic and anti-ageing effect of the Murraya koenigii leaves by using the drying method of convective hot-air drying (40, 50 and 60 °C) and two hybrid drying methods through microwave vacuum-drying (6, 9 and 12 W/g) and convective hot-air pre-drying followed by microwave vacuum finishing-drying (50 °C followed by 9 W/g), in addition to the freeze-drying, which was used as a control method. The anti-diabetic activity was evaluated by using α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition method, while the anti-ageing activity was measured by using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition effect. The results indicated that the dried leaves of M. koenigii were more selective towards α-glucosidase inhibition with the percentage ranging from 7.92 to 23.57% at the concentration of 62.52 ± 22.18 to 20.39 ± 2.01 mg dried leaves/mL. Concerning the anti-ageing activity, the inhibition effect of AChE was significantly weaker compared to BChE inhibition, revealing that the dried M. koenigii leaves were more selective towards BChE inhibition with the percentage ranged from 79.47 to 87.07%. Furthermore, the Page model and diffusion models showed a good fitting of the model to the empirical data of drying kinetics with the highest coefficient of determination (0.9996; 0.9995) and the lowest values of root-mean-square error (0.0102; 0.0090) and Chi-square coefficients (0.0010; 0.0008). Overall, microwave vacuum-drying is the recommended drying method to be used for M. koenigii leaves due to its promising result obtained for the inhibition of α-glucosidase and BChE. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The leaves of Vitis vinifera L. have been used for a long time in traditional medicine for the treatment of many ailments. Grape polyphenols, indeed, have been demonstrated to be able to defend against oxidative stress, responsible for various disorders such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. The effects of different extraction techniques, Soxhlet (SOX), Accelerated Solvent (ASE 40, ASE 50) and Ultrasound Assisted Extraction (UAE) were studied in this work to evaluate their impact on the chemical profile and bioactive potential of Vitis vinifera L. (cv. Aglianico) leaf extracts. The phytochemical profile was investigated by HPLC-DAD and 9 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in the extract. Moreover, the antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antityrosinase activities were evaluated. In detail, the total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacities and β-Carotene Bleaching assays) were evaluated and compared to assess the Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI). To test the inhibitory activity of extracts towards cholinesterases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition assays were performed. SOX and ASE 50 have shown the highest value of RACI, 0.76 and 0.65, respectively. Regarding enzymatic inhibitory activity, ASE 50 (IC50 = 107.16 ± 8.12 µg/mL) and SOX (IC50 = 171.34 ± 12.12 µg/mL) extracts exhibited the highest AChE and BChE inhibitory activity, respectively, while UAE (IC50 = 293.2 ± 25.6 µg/mL, followed by SOX (IC50 = 302.5 ± 38.3 µg/mL) showed the highest tyrosinase inhibition value. Our results demonstrated for the first time that Aglianico leaves are important sources of phenols that could be used to prevent oxidative stress and be potentially helpful in diseases treatable with tyrosinase and cholinesterase inhibitors, like myasthenia gravis or Alzheimer’s. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={In the present study, essential oils extracted from the leafy stems of Ocimum basilicum (Family Lamiaceae) and Pulicaria undulata (Family Asteraceae) were investigated for their chemical profiles and biological activity including antioxidant, antiproliferative and enzyme inhibition activities. The chemical composition of essential oil was determined using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The antioxidant capacity was tested by scavenging of free radicals, reduction potential, chelating ability on ferrous ions and phosphomolybdenum assays. Cell viability was evaluated on human breast carcinoma (MCF7) and human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29 and HCT116) cell lines. Enzymatic activity was evaluated against α-glucosidase, α-amylase, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase. Based on the results obtained, in silico studies was performed to identify potential inhibitor of tyrosinase activity. Results showed that oil of O. basilicum was predominantly composed of methyl chavicol (51.9%) followed by linalool (20.0%). Oil of P. undulata was represented by oxygenated monoterpenes (96.9%) with carvotanacetone (92.1%) as the main molecule. Both oils exerted antioxidant activities with oil from P. undulata exerted significant (p&lt;0.05) higher scavenging activity (20.92±0.05DPPH and 62.36±0.25ABTS mg trolox equivalents (TEs)/g) while that obtained from O. basillicum showed significant (p&lt;0.05) higher total antioxidant activity (16.72±0.95 mmol TEs/g), ion reducing power (86.30±2.80FRAP and 115.31±2.03CUPRAC mg TEs/g) and metal chelating ability (21.08±3.45 mg disodium edetate equivalents /g). Both oils showed considerable tyrosinase and α-amylase inhibition activity while only oil of P. undulata displayed acetylcholinesterase (0.95 ± 0.06 mg galanthamine equivalents (GALAEs)/g), butyrylcholinesterase (1.19 ± 0.13 mg GALAEs/g) and α-glucosidase (32.59 ± 0.20 mg acarbose equivalents (ACAEs)/g) inhibition capacity. Both oils showed good anti-proliferative activity towards the three cell lines with higher activity observed from that of O. basillicum (2.8–3.3 µg/mL). In silico studies suggested that methyl chavicol represent a potential inhibitor of tyrosinase activity.

The same metal complex was also observed to inhibit the activity of Candida albicans. The thermal degradation studies suggest that the order of stability and activation energies of all compounds is as follows: Cu &lt; H-HMAC &lt; Ni &lt; Co = Zn and E*Zn&gt; E*Co&gt; E*Ni&gt; E*Cu, respectively. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Molecules capable of engaging with multiple targets associated with pathological condition of Alzheimer's disease have proved to be potential anti-Alzheimer's agents. In our goal to develop multitarget-directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a novel series of carbazole-based stilbene derivatives were designed by the fusion of carbazole ring with stilbene scaffold. The designed compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-AD activities including cholinesterase inhibition, Aβ aggregation inhibition, antioxidant and metal chelation properties. Amongst them, (E)-1-(4-(2-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)vinyl)phenyl)-3-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl)thiourea (50) appeared to be the best candidate with good inhibitory activities against AChE (IC50 value of 2.64 μM) and BuChE (IC50 value of 1.29 μM), and significant inhibition of self-mediated Aβ1–42 aggregation (51.29% at 25 μM concentration). The metal chelation study showed that compound (50) possessed specific copper ion chelating property. Additionally, compound (50) exhibited moderate antioxidant activity. To understand the binding mode of 50, molecular docking studies were performed, and the results indicated strong non-covalent interactions of 50 with the enzymes in the active sites of AChE, BuChE as well as of the Aβ1-42 peptide. Additionally, it showed promising in silico ADMET properties. Putting together, these findings evidently showed compound (50) as a potential multitarget-directed ligand in the course of developing novel anti-AD drugs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Abstract: A novel scaffold of N-substituted (3-(1-aminoethylidene)-2-oxochroman-4-yl)phosphonic acid diethyl ester derivatives was designed, synthesized and evaluated as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors against Alzheimer’s disease. Compounds 2a, 2b, 2d and 2q proved to be more potent than the standard drug galantamine and rivastigmine for AChE inhibitory activity with IC50 value between 0.50 and 3.94 µM. All the synthesized compounds proved to be only weak BuChE inhibitors. The compounds showed cytotoxicity in the same range as that of standard drugs against HEK-293 cells. Molecular docking studies suggested that compound 2q is acting as a dual binding site inhibitor by occupying the enzymatic catalytic active site, mid-gorge and peripheral anionic site. The coumarin moiety showed a π–π stacking interaction with Trp84 and hydrogen bonds with the P=O and C=O was found with Ser122 and Tyr121 at the catalytic active site. At the peripheral anionic site, the phenyl ring and quinoline ring were stacked against the Tyr 334 and Trp279 through π–π stacking interaction, respectively. The predicted ADME showed a good pharmacokinetic profile. DNA cleavage studies suggested that compounds 2a, 2b, 2d and 2q can be considered as non-toxic. Thus, compound 2q could be a promising lead structure for further development as anti-Alzheimer agents.

abstract={Babesia bigemina infection (also known as Texas fever) is reported as the most prevalent and main causative agent of bovine babesiosis, worldwide. The current study was undertaken to assess indicators of oxidative stress including activities of antioxidant enzymes and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxidation status of biomolecules and serum levels of trace elements as well as indicators of inflammation including sialic acid (SA) contents and cholinesterase activity in cattle naturally infected with B. bigemina. An infected group comprised of 20 crossbred Holstein cattle (3–4 years old) were diagnosed to be positive by both microscopy and nested PCR assay. The infected animals were subdivided into two groups according to their parasitemia rates (<20 % and>20 %). Furthermore, 10 healthy cattle were included as the control. The infection caused severe anemia in a parasitemia-burden dependent fashion. The activities of catalase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as well as the levels of TAC, zinc, selenium, copper and manganese were significantly decreased as the parasitemia increased, accordingly. However, the activity of superoxide dismutase as well as the levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonylation, DNA damage and iron, were significantly elevated in a parasitemeia-burden dependent manner. Additionally, glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly elevated with the lower rate of parasitemia, but the higher rate had no significant effect as compared to control. Moreover, total, protein and lipid binding SA contents were significantly increased but the activities of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase were significantly reduced, parasitemia dependently. Conclusively, the infection was remarkably associated with the induction of anemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. © 2020},

abstract={PHELA is a South African traditional medicine formulation. The decoction and infusion with water is consumed orally by persons with compromised immune systems. The present investigation is based on different approaches of exploitation and exploration of PHELA for cholinesterase inhibition activity based on its biomarker profiling. The extract was subjected to qualitative and quantitative phytochemical screening (total flavonoids and phenolic contents) spectrophotometrically. The extract was standardized for the presence of emodin as standard phytomarker through HPTLC analysis (Mukherjee, 2019). The in vitro cholinesterase inhibition potential of the extract was performed using a 96-well micro plate assaybased on Ellman's method using galanthamine as standard inhibitor. The results of the cholinesterase enzyme inhibition assay were expressed as IC50 values. Estimated contents of total phenolics and flavonoids in the extract were found to be 16.92 ± 0.13 mg of GA/g and 13.71 ± 0.11 mg of RU/g respectively. For PHELA extract the IC50 values were found to be 105.89 μg/ml for DPPH assay and 107.99 μg/ml for hydroxyl radical scavenging assay. The IC50values for standard ascorbic acid were found to be 93.21 μg/ml and 98.73 μg/ml. The amount of standard ursolic acid and emodin were quantitatively determined through HPTLC analysis and were found to be 0.53%w/w and 1.53%w/w respectively. The IC50 values for inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzyme were 257.94 ± 1.37 μg/mL for PHELA and 20.15 ± 0.16 μg/mL for galantamine.The South African traditional formulation was investigated for its beneficial effects on neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. All the findings together showed that it may serve as a useful source for phytochemicals against disorders like Alzheimer's. © 2020},

abstract={Essential oils (EOs) hold tremendous medicinal attributes and are greatly exploited industrially worldwide. In the present study, the chemical composition of five EOs prepared from four aromatic plants were revealed together with their inhibitory activities against five key clinical enzymes (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, tyrosinase, acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase). Limonene (84.3%) and sabinene (38.1%) were the most dominant constituents present in Citrus aurantium fruit peel and leaf EOs respectively. Turmerone (31.4%), ar-turmerone (16.1%), and turmerol (14.6%) were the principal components identified in Curcuma longa rhizome EO. Additionally, Morinda citrifolia fruit EO was abundant in octanoic acid (78.9%), while carvacrol (17.9%), δ-3-carene (15.2%), and camphor (12.9%) were predominant in Plectranthus amboinicus EO. The investigated EOs were all active inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, amylase, and tyrosinase. Morinda citrifolia and P. amboinicus EOs inhibited butyrylcholinesterase exclusively, while M. citrifolia and C. aurantium fruit peel EOs displayed inhibition against glucosidase as well. Due to strong interactions with their active sites, molecular docking showed turmerone followed by carvacrol to have the highest binding affinities with target enzymes. Moderate to strong antioxidant potential was also demonstrated by all EOs. However, P. amboinicus EO presented the most potent antioxidant capacity and contained the highest amount of phenolics, while M. citrifolia EO was the weakest among all. Besides, a strong positive correlation was noted between EOs’ antioxidant capacities and total phenolic content. With the exception of C. aurantium leaf and C. longa EOs which showed similar bioactivities and were grouped together, the other EOs were subdivided into distinct groups by principal component analysis. Altogether, this study highlighted interesting pharmacological properties of the investigated EOs that could serve as sources of bioactive ingredients with potential industrial applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tricholosporum goniospermum (Bres.) Guzmán ex T.J. Baroni is an excellent edible mushroom whose compounds and biological properties are still unknown. In this study, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from fruiting bodies and liquid-cultured mycelia were compared for the analysis of phenolic compounds, the evaluation of scavenger (DPPH, ABTS) and reducing (CUPRAC, FRAP) activities, and the enzyme inhibition of α-amylase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and tyrosinase. Additionally, T. goniospermum extracts were evaluated for antibacterial and antimycotic activities against Gram+ and Gram− bacteria, and clinical yeast and fungal dermatophytes. Finally, based on the extract content in phenolic compounds, in silico studies, including the docking approach, were conducted to predict the putative targets (namely tyrosinase, lanosterol-14-α-demethylase, the multidrug efflux system transporters of E. coli (mdtK) and P. aeruginosa (pmpM), and S. aureus β-lactamase (ORF259)) underlying the observed bio-pharmacological and microbiological effects. The methanolic extract from mycelia was the richest in gallic acid, whereas the ethyl acetate extract from fruiting bodies was the sole extract to show levels of catechin. Specifically, docking runs demonstrated an affinity of catechin towards all docked proteins, in the micromolar range. These in silico data are consistent, at least in part, with the highest activity of ethyl acetate extract as an antimicrobial and anti-tyrosinase (554.30 mg KAE/g for fruiting bodies and 412.81 mg KAE/g for mycelia) agent. The ethyl acetate extracts were also noted as being the most active (2.97 mmol ACAE/g for fruiting bodies and 2.25 mmol ACAE/g for mycelia) on α-amylase. BChE inhibitory activities varied from 2.61 to 26.78 mg GALAE/g, while the tested extracts were not active on AChE. In conclusion, all mushroom extracts tested in this study had potent antimicrobial activities. Particularly, among the tested extracts, the ethyl acetate extract showed the highest efficacy as both an antimicrobial and anti-tyrosinase agent. This could be related, albeit partially, to its content of catechin. In this regard, the bioinformatics analyses showed interactions of catechin with tyrosinase and specific microbial proteins involved in the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, thus suggesting innovative pharmacological applications of T. goniospermum extracts. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={In the current work, we developed a computational pipeline method for predicting the binding affinities of studied compounds at the specific target sites. Since many approved therapeutic compounds involve indole or indole-derivative rings, in the current study we focused compounds including these fingerprints. Initially, 212520 compounds were retrieved from Specs-SC library and after the conversion of IUPAC text file format, compounds that include ‘indol’ keyword (5194 compounds) were used in binary QSAR-based models to screen against a defined therapeutic activity “Alzheimer’s disease” (AD). The molecules that have higher AD therapeutic activity values (>0.5) were then used in the 26 different toxicity-QSAR models. Binary QSAR models resulted 89 hits that have high AD therapeutic activity and no toxicity. Selected 89 molecules were then screened against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) targets using molecular docking and top-docking poses of compounds were used in initially short (10 ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations were performed for 89 ligands and tightly bound 17 ligands based on average MM/GBSA scores were selected for long (100 ns) MD simulations. The same protocol was also applied for the known 4 AChE inhibitors. Selected hits were also docked to the binding pocket of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Finally, based on MM/GBSA scores, as well as their corresponding docking scores and metabolite production profiles, 7 compounds were selected and their in vitro tests were performed. Out of 7 compounds, 6 of them showed μM-level inhibition for both AChE and BChE targets. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Methods: The patients, aged 65-85 yr, weighing 50-80 kg, of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status Ⅰ-Ⅲ, underwent total knee/hip arthroplasty under combined spinal-epidural block in our hospital from July 2018 to September 2019, were collected.The baseline clinical data of patients were collected, and cubital venous blood samples 5 ml were collected before anesthesia to detect plasma concentrations of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The neuropsychological testing was performed on 1 day before operation, following admission to the recovery room after surgery, and on 1, 3 and 7 days (or before discharge) after surgery.The patient′s cognitive function was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before surgery.Confusion Assessment Method and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale were used to evaluate the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) after surgery.The patients were divided into POD group (P group) and non-POD group (NP group) according to whether POD occurred.Logistic regression was used to analyze the related risk factors for POD. Results: There were 349 cases in NP group and 57 cases in P group, and the incidence of POD was 14.0%.Compared with NP group, the age of patients, preoperative coexisting underlying diseases (≥3 types), plasma ChAT, TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were increased, and plasma AChE and BuChE concentrations were decreased in P group (P<0.05). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that changes in plasma AChE, BuChE, and ChAT concentrations and older age were independent risk factors for POD (P<0.05). Conclusion: The development of POD is related to the preoperative changes in plasma AChE, BuChE and ChAT concentrations in elderly patients. © 2020 Chinese Medical Association},

abstract={In order to obtain multi-functional molecules for Alzheimer's disease, a series of deferiprone derivatives has been synthesized and evaluated in vitro with the hypothesis that they can restore the cholinergic tone and attenuate the dyshomeostasis of the metals mainly involved in the pathology. These compounds were designed as dual binding site AChE inhibitors: they possess an arylalkylamine moiety connected via an alkyl chain to a 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone fragment, to allow the simultaneous interaction with catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme. Deferiprone moiety and 2-aminopyridine, 2-aminopyrimidine or 2,4-diaminopyrimidine groups have been incorporated into these compounds, in order to obtain molecules potentially able to chelate bio-metals colocalized in Aβ plaques and involved in the generation of radical species. Synthesized compounds were tested by enzymatic inhibition studies towards EeAChE and eqBChE using Ellman's method. The most potent EeAChE inhibitor is compound 5a, with a Ki of 788 ± 51 nM, while the most potent eqBChE inhibitors are compounds 12 and 19, with Ki values of 182 ± 18 nM and 258 ± 25 nM respectively. Selected compounds, among the most potent cholinesterases inhibitors, were able to form complex with iron and in some cases with copper and zinc.

The results of anticholinesterase activity indicated that nine compounds 3, 8, 10, 14, 24, 25, 27, 38, and 45 significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzymes and thirty-three compounds 1–4, 7–14, 22–28, 32–41, 44–47 inhibited butyrylcholinesterase enzymes (BChE) more than galantamine. In addition, virtual screening methods based on ligand 45 having the best activity against BChE was used to define new human BChE inhibitors. The interactions of ligand 8 against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were also examined. Important key residues were determined and visualized on completion of the methodology. All calculations indicated the suitability of use of the molecular docking approach for understanding interaction mechanisms and crucial fragments of novel hit compounds such as the potential lead AChE and BChE inhibitor candidates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aim: This study investigated the effects of polar Butia odorata fruit extract on metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress parameters in rats submitted to a hyperlipidaemia condition induced by tyloxapol. Methods: Animals were divided into 3 groups: saline, saline plus tyloxapol, and B. odorata extract plus tyloxapol. Animals were treated for 15 days with a saline solution or B. odorata fruit extract and after hyperlipidaemia was induced by tyloxapol. Results: Treatment with B. odorata extract reduced serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and adenosine deaminase and butyrylcholinesterase activities when compared to the tyloxapol group. HDL-cholesterol and paraoxonase 1 activity were higher in B. odorata extract treated animals when compared to tyloxapol-treated animals. No differences were observed in hepatic oxidative stress parameters. Phenolic compounds present in B. odorata fruit extract were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS. Conclusion: These findings indicated that phenolic rich B. odorata extract has hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects in hyperlipidemic rats. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={A small library of new organophosphorylated warfarins and 3-benzylcoumarins were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro cholinesterase inhibition by Ellman's method. Most of the compounds were found to be selective for butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) over acetylcholinesterase (AChE), with IC50 values ranging from 0.363 μM to 53.0 μM determined after 15 s of enzyme exposure. Comparison of the most potent compound, 3b with its constitutional isomer 2b revealed the high importance of phosphate positioning. Reversed selectivity and a 100-fold reduction in anti-BChE activity was observed when the organophosphate was attached to the benzyl instead of the coumarin. Docking calculations suggest that 3b binds initially as a transition state mimic with near-optimal phosphate orientation relative to S198 and occupation of the oxyanion hole prior to phosphorylation. These results might inspire the design of a new type of non-neuropathic and irreversible coumarin-based inhibitor against BChE. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Glutamine residues susceptible to transglutaminase-catalyzed crosslinking can be identified by incorporation of dansyl cadaverine or biotin cadaverine. Bacterial transglutaminase and human transglutaminase 2 were used to modify residues in beta-casein with dansyl cadaverine. Bacterial transglutaminase was used to modify residues in human butyrylcholinesterase with biotin cadaverine. Tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. Modified residues were identified in Protein Prospector searches of mass spectrometry data. The MS/MS spectra from modified casein included intense peaks at 336.2, 402.2, and 447.2 for fragments of dansyl cadaverine adducts on glutamine. The MS/MS spectra from modified butyrylcholinesterase included intense peaks at 329.2, 395.2, and 440.2 for fragments of biotin cadaverine adducts on glutamine. No evidence for transglutaminase-catalyzed adducts on glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or asparagine was found. Consistent with expectation, it was concluded that bacterial transglutaminase and human transglutaminase 2 specifically modify glutamine. The characteristic ions associated with dansyl cadaverine and biotin cadaverine adducts on glutamine are useful markers for modified peptides. © 2020},

abstract={A novel series of aromatic esters (1a-1m) related to the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid (AA) haemanthamine were designed, synthesized and tested in vitro with particular emphasis on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Some of the synthesized compounds revealed promising acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory profile. Significant human AChE (hAChE) inhibition was demonstrated by 11-O-(3-nitrobenzoyl)haemanthamine (1j) with IC50value of 4.0 ± 0.3 µM. The strongest human BuChE (hBuChE) inhibition generated 1-O-(2-methoxybenzoyl)haemanthamine (1g) with IC50 value 3.3 ± 0.4 µM. Moreover, 11-O-(2-chlorbenzoyl)haemanthamine (1m) was able to inhibit both enzymes in dose-dependent manner. The mode of hAChE and hBuChE inhibition was minutely inspected using enzyme kinetic analysis in tandem with in silico experiments, the latter elucidating crucial interaction in 1j-, 1m-hAChE and 1g-, 1m-hBuChE complexes.

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-secretase 1 (BACE 1) play vital roles in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of the present study was to identify fish roe-derived anti-AD peptides with activities against AChE, BChE, and BACE 1. Fish roe proteins were cleaved in silico by gastrointestinal proteases, and the released peptides were collected. Subsequently, the toxicity, solubility, and biological properties of these novel di- and tri-peptides were predicted and validated. Finally, potential anti-AD peptides were docked to targets, i.e., AChE, BChE, and BACE 1. A novel anti-AD tripeptide WIR with potent inhibition of AChE and BACE 1 was identified, with IC50 values of 43.32 ± 1.22 µM and 2.27 ± 0.35 mM, respectively. In addition, the inhibition rate of WIR (at a concentration of 1.06 ± 0.87 µM) against BChE was 33.5%, and the peptide WIR was able to simultaneously interact with AChE, BChE, and BACE 1. Residues Ser286 of AChE, Asp70 of BChE, and Thr231, Arg235 of BACE 1 played key roles in the interaction with peptide WIR. In summary, peptide WIR exhibits the potential to be an effective treatment for AD. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with cholinergic dysfunction, provoking memory loss and cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. The cholinergic hypothesis provided over the years with molecular targets for developing palliative treatments for AD, acting on the cholinergic system, namely, acetylcholinesterase and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR). In our synthetic work, we used “click-chemistry” to synthesize two Multi Target Directed Ligands (MTDLs) MB105 and MB118 carrying tacrine and quinuclidine scaffolds which are known for their anticholinesterase and α7 nAChR agonist activities, respectively. Both, MB105 and MB118, inhibit human acetylcholinesterase and human butyrylcholinesterase in the nanomolar range. Electrophysiological recordings on Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human α7 nAChR showed that MB105 and MB118 acted as partial agonists of the referred nicotinic receptor, albeit, with different potencies despite their similar structure. The different substitution at C-3 on the 2,3-disubstituted quinuclidine scaffold may account for the significantly lower potency of MB118 compared to MB105. Electrophysiological recordings also showed that the tacrine precursor MB320 behaved as a competitive antagonist of human α7 nAChR, in the micromolar range, while the quinuclidine synthetic precursor MB099 acted as a partial agonist. Taken all together, MB105 behaved as a partial agonist of α7 nAChR at concentrations where it completely inhibited human acetylcholinesterase activity paving the way for the design of novel MTDLs for palliative treatment of AD. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A new series of homobivalent Dimebon analogs, bis-γ-carbolines with alkylene, phenylenedialkylene, and triazole-containing spacers, was synthesized. Doubling the γ-carboline pharmacophore increased inhibitory potency against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) compared with Dimebon, while keeping Dimebon's anti-butyrylcholinesterase activity; therefore, leading to inversion of selectivity. Molecular docking revealed the reasons for the increased anti-AChE activity and ability to block AChE-induced aggregation of β-amyloid for bis-γ-carbolines, which became double-site inhibitors of AChE. Conjugates with ditriazole-containing spacers were the most active antioxidants in both the ABTS-test and prevention of lipid peroxidation in brain homogenates without inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Conjugates with alkylene (4a-d), phenylenedialkylene (4e), and monotriazole (8) spacers were less active as antioxidants but prevented induction of the MPT and increased the calcium retention capacity of mitochondria. Lead compound 4e showed neuroprotective potential in a cellular calcium overload model of neurodegeneration. Computational studies showed that all the bis-γ-carbolines were expected to have high values for intestinal absorption and very good blood-brain barrier permeability along with good drug-likeness. Overall, the results showed that new homobivalent Dimebon analogs exhibit an expanded spectrum of biological activity and improved pharmacological properties, making them promising candidates for further research and optimization as multitarget agents for Alzheimer's disease treatment. © 2020 IUPAC & De Gruyter.

abstract={Compounds capable of interacting with single or multiple targets involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis are potential anti-Alzheimer's agents. In our aim to develop new anti-Alzheimer's agents, a series of 36 new N-alkylpiperidine carbamates was designed, synthesized and evaluated for the inhibition of cholinesterases [acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)] and monoamine oxidases [monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)]. Four compounds are very promising: multiple AChE (IC50 = 7.31 μM), BChE (IC50 = 0.56 μM) and MAO-B (IC50 = 26.1 μM) inhibitor 10, dual AChE (IC50 = 2.25 μM) and BChE (IC50 = 0.81 μM) inhibitor 22, selective BChE (IC50 = 0.06 μM) inhibitor 13, and selective MAO-B (IC50 = 0.18 μM) inhibitor 16. Results of enzyme kinetics experiments showed that despite the carbamate group in the structure, compounds 10, 13, and 22 are reversible and non-time-dependent inhibitors of AChE and/or BChE. The resolved crystal structure of the complex of BChE with compound 13 confirmed the non-covalent mechanism of inhibition. Additionally, N-propargylpiperidine 16 is an irreversible and time-dependent inhibitor of MAO-B, while N-benzylpiperidine 10 is reversible. Additionally, compounds 10, 13, 16, and 22 should be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and are not cytotoxic to human neuronal-like SH-SY5Y and liver HepG2 cells. Finally, compounds 10 and 16 also prevent amyloid β1–42 (Aβ1–42)-induced neuronal cell death. The neuroprotective effects of compound 16 could be the result of its Aβ1–42 anti-aggregation effects. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={In addition to antibacterial and antitumor effects, synthetic ruthenium complexes have been reported to inhibit several medicinally important enzymes, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE). They may also interact with muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and thus affect the neuromuscular transmission and muscle function. In the present study, the effects of the organometallic ruthenium complex of 5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline (nitrophen) were evaluated on these systems. The organoruthenium-nitrophen complex [(η6-p-cymene)Ru(nitrophen)Cl]Cl; C22H21Cl2N3O2Ru (C1-Cl) was synthesized, structurally characterized and evaluated in vitro for its inhibitory activity against electric eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE), human recombinant acetylcholinesterase (hrAChE), horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (hsBChE) and horse liver glutathione-S-transferase. The physiological effects of C1-Cl were then studied on isolated mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm muscle preparations, by means of single twitch measurements and electrophysiological recordings. The compound C1-Cl acted as a competitive inhibitor of eeAChE, hrAChE and hsBChE with concentrations producing 50 % inhibition (IC50) of enzyme activity ranging from 16 to 26 μM. Moreover, C1-Cl inhibited the nerve-evoked isometric muscle contraction (IC50 = 19.44 μM), without affecting the directly-evoked muscle single twitch up to 40 μM. The blocking effect of C1-Cl was rapid and almost completely reversed by neostigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. The endplate potentials were also inhibited by C1-Cl in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 7.6 μM) without any significant change in the resting membrane potential of muscle fibers up to 40 μM. Finally, C1-Cl (5–40 μM) decreased (i) the amplitude of miniature endplate potentials until a complete block by concentrations higher than 25 μM and (ii) their frequency at 10 μM or higher concentrations. The compound C1-Cl reversibly blocked the neuromuscular transmission in vitro by a non-depolarizing mechanism and mainly through an action on postsynaptic nAChRs. The compound C1-Cl may be therefore interesting for further preclinical testing as a new competitive neuromuscular blocking, and thus myorelaxant, drug. © 2020 The Author(s)},

We present herein the evaluation of 8-hydroxyquinoline-based analogues with activities against butyrylcholinesterase and β-secretase activity of cathepsin B. Furthermore, inhibition of amyloid β aggregation, chelation of copper and zinc ions coupled with antioxidative properties and safe cytotoxicity profile of (1R,2S)-N-ethyl-2-[[(8-hydroxy-5-nitroquinolin-7-yl)methyl]amino]cyclohexane-1-carboxamide suggest that this derivative is a good starting point for optimization towards an effective multifunctional ligand.

abstract={In recent decade, the entrance of α-N-heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones derivates (Triapne, COTI-2 and DpC) in clinical trials for cancer and HIV-1 has vastly increased the interests of medicinal chemists towards this class of organic compounds. In the given study, a series of eighteen new (3a-r) 3-ethoxy salicylaldehyde-based thiosemicarbazones (TSC), bearing aryl and cycloalkyl substituents, were synthesized and assayed for their pharmacological potential against carbonic anhydrases (hCA I and hCA II), cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) and α-glycosidase. The hCA I isoform was inhibited by these novel 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives (3a-r) in low nanomolar levels, the Ki of which differed between 144.18 ± 26.74 and 454.92 ± 48.32 nM. Against the physiologically dominant isoform hCA II, the novel compounds demonstrated Kis varying from 110.54 ± 14.05 to 444.12 ± 36.08 nM. Also, these novel derivatives (3a-r) effectively inhibited AChE, with Ki values in the range of 385.38 ± 45.03 to 983.04 ± 104.64 nM. For BChE was obtained with Ki values in the range of 400.21 ± 35.68 to 1003.02 ± 154.27 nM. For α-glycosidase the most effective Ki values of 3l, 3n, and 3q were with Ki values of 12.85 ± 1.05, 16.03 ± 2.84, and 19.16 ± 2.66 nM, respectively. Moreover, the synthesized TCSs were simulated using force field methods whereas the binding energies of the selected compounds were estimated using MM-GBSA method. The findings indicate the present novel 3-ethoxy salicylaldehyde-based thiosemicarbazones to be excellent hits for pharmaceutical applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The present work was conducted to evaluate the quantitative analysis of the leaves of Aloe vera and to evaluate their potential antioxidant, anti-Alzheimer and antidiabetic properties in vitro. The acetone extract, methanolic extract and its four fractions were subjected to quantitative determination of polyphenol, flavonoid, flavonol, condensed tannin and hydrolysable tannin contents. Then, the antioxidant properties of all extracts and fractions were evaluated by using DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS cation radical decolorization, Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity and Metal Chelating Activity assays. Anti-Alzheimer activity was tested against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes using the Ellman method. The antidiabetic activity was evaluated by using Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibition Assay. The acetone extract showed the highest amount of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), flavonol content (FLC) and total condensed tannins content (TCTC) compared to others extracts and fractions. The water fraction exhibited the low content of TFC, TPC and FLC. The content of total hydrolysable tannins (THTC) varied from 0.94 ± 0.01 to 1.22 ± 0.02 μg TAE/mg extract. The methanolic extract exhibited highest antioxidant activity in all tests (IC50 value: 24.21±0.30 μg/mL in DPPH assay, IC50 value: 30.75±1.67 μg/mL in ABTS assay, IC50 value: 140.99±2.95 μg/mL in metal chelating activity, and IC50 value: 17.50±0.47 μg/mL in CUPRAC assay). Furthermore, the n-butanol fraction indicated the highest BChE inhibitory activity (IC50 value: 79.61±2.41 μg/ml) and the good a-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 value: 40.75±0.06 μg/ml). These results showed that Aloe vera leaves, can be used in food and pharmaceutical industries as natural antioxidants, as well as moderate anti-Alzheimer and antidiabetic agents. © 2020 Chiang Mai University.},

abstract={Background: In Chile organophosphate pesticides are widely used in the production of fruits. Pesticides use is regulated for professional practice but there is no regulation regarding exposure to the general population. Objective: To relate exposure to cholinesterase's inhibitor pesticides during the spray season with neuropsychological impairment in occupationally exposed (OE) and environmentally exposed (EE) groups of people. Methods: Exposure was assessed through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity and neuropsychological outcomes were evaluated through a large battery of tests covering general mental status, language, memory, attention, executive function, praxis and psychomotricity. Evaluations were carried out firstly in a period of no/low organophosphate pesticide use and subsequently during the spray season. All parameters were calculated as the relative change from baseline to spray season. Results: For this study in total 156 participants were recruited divided equally over participants with environmental exposures (EE) and participants with occupational exposure (OE). In the EE, BChE's enzyme activity inhibition ≥30% showed significant association with 10% or more decreased performance in several tests evaluating six of the eight cognitive areas (excepting psychomotricity and mood status); besides, for AChE inhibition in EE, the association was significant in three tests evaluating attention and one of executive function. Whereas, in OE, the inhibition of the BChE ≥30% was associated with a low performance of one attention test and for AChE the exceedance of the standard was associated with diminished performance in one test of memory and attention, respectively. The association between biomarkers of biological effect and cognitive impairment persisted among the EE group after removing confounders. No association was found between biomarkers of biological acute effect and decreased cognitive performance in the OE group. Conclusions: Increased exposure to pesticides was confirmed by increased inhibition of cholinesterase's in both exposure groups; which was associated with a diminished neuropsychological performance, mainly in the environmentally exposed study group.

abstract={This study reports the synthesis of sulfonamide-derived Schiff bases as ligands L1 and L2 as well as their transition metal complexes [VO(IV), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)]. The Schiff bases (4-{E-[(2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methylidene]amino}benzene-1-sulfonamide (L1) and 4-{[(2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methylidene]amino}-N-(5-methyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl)benzene-1-sulfonamide (L2) were synthesized by the condensation reaction of 4-aminobenzene-1-sulfonamide and 4-amino-N-(3-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2-oxazol-5-yl)benzene-1-sulfonamide with 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde in an equimolar ratio. Sulfonamide core ligands behaved as bidentate ligands and coordinated with transition metals via nitrogen of azomethine and the oxygen of the hydroxyl group. Ligand L1 was recovered in its crystalline form and was analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique which held monoclinic crystal system with space group (P21/c). The structures of the ligands L1and L2 and their transition metal complexes were established by their physical (melting point, color, yields, solubility, magnetic susceptibility, and conductance measurements), spectral (UV–visible [UV–Vis], Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass analysis), and analytical (CHN analysis) techniques. Furthermore, computational analysis (vibrational bands, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), and natural bonding orbitals [NBOs]) were performed for ligands through density functional theory utilizing B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level and UV–Vis analysis was carried out by time-dependent density functional theory. Theoretical spectroscopic data were in line with the experimental spectroscopic data. NBO analysis confirmed the extraordinary stability of the ligands in their conjugative interactions. Global reactivity parameters computed from the FMO energies indicated the ligands were bioactive by nature. These procedures ensured the charge transfer phenomenon for the ligands and reasonable relevance was established with experimental results. The synthesized compounds were screened for antimicrobial activities against bacterial (Streptococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Eshcheria coli, and Klebsiella pneomoniae) species and fungal (Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavous) strains. A further assay was designed for screening of their antioxidant activities (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine radical scavenging activity, total phenolic contents, and total iron reducing power) and enzyme inhibition properties (amylase, protease, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase). The substantial results of these activities proved the ligands and their transition metal complexes to be bioactive in their nature. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Tramadol and tapentadol are fully synthetic and extensively used analgesic opioids, presenting enhanced therapeutic and safety profiles as compared with their peers. However, reports of adverse reactions, intoxications and fatalities have been increasing. Information regarding the molecular, biochemical, and histological alterations underlying their toxicological potential is missing, particularly for tapentadol, owing to its more recent market authorization. Considering the paramount importance of liver and kidney for the metabolism and excretion of both opioids, these organs are especially susceptible to toxicological damage. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the putative hepatic and renal deleterious effects of repeated exposure to therapeutic doses of tramadol and tapentadol, using an in vivo animal model. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six experimental groups, composed of six animals each, which received daily single intraperitoneal injections of 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg tramadol or tapentadol (a low, standard analgesic dose, an intermediate dose and the maximum recommended daily dose, respectively). An additional control group was injected with normal saline. Following 14 consecutive days of administration, serum, urine and liver and kidney tissue samples were processed for biochemical, metabolic and histological analysis. Repeated administration of therapeutic doses of both opioids led to: (i) increased lipid and protein oxidation in liver and kidney, as well as to decreased total liver antioxidant capacity; (ii) decreased serum albumin, urea, butyrylcholinesterase and complement C3 and C4 levels, denoting liver synthesis impairment; (iii) elevated serum activity of liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, as well as lipid profile alterations, also reflecting hepatobiliary commitment; (iv) derangement of iron metabolism, as shown through increases in serum iron, ferritin, haptoglobin and heme oxygenase-1 levels. In turn, elevated serum cystatin C, decreased urine creatinine output and increased urine microalbumin levels were detected upon exposure to tapentadol only, while increased serum amylase and urine N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activities were observed for both opioids. Collectively, these results are compatible with kidney injury. Changes were also found in the expression levels of liver-and kidney-specific toxicity biomarker genes, upon exposure to tramadol and tapentadol, correlating well with alterations in lipid profile, iron metabolism and glomerular and tubular function. Histopathological analysis evidenced sinusoidal dilatation, microsteatosis, mononuclear cell infiltrates, glomerular and tubular disorganization, and increased Bowman’s spaces. Although some findings are more pronounced upon tapentadol exposure, our study shows that, when compared with acute exposure, prolonged administration of both opioids smooths the differences between their toxicological effects, and that these occur at lower doses within the therapeutic range. © 2020 by the authors.

The anti-cholinesterase activity and neuroprotective effects of three different cultivars of hardy kiwifruits, cv. Mansu (A. arguta × A. deliciosa), cv. Haeyeon (A. arguta), and cv. Chiak (A. arguta), on PC-12 and SH-SY5Y cells were evaluated. Extraction of phenolics and vitamin C was carried out using 80% (v/v) aqueous ethanol and metaphosphoric acid assisted with homogenization, respectively. Hardy kiwifruit of cv. Mansu showed higher total phenolic, total flavonoid, and vitamin C contents and antioxidant capacity compared to the other two cultivars of hardy kiwifruits, cv. Haeyeon and cv. Chiak. Analysis of high-performance liquid chromatography results revealed the presence of procyanidin B2, (−)-epicatechin, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, and astragalin in hardy kiwifruits. The three cultivars of hardy kiwifruits had a wide range of vitamin C content of 55.2−130.0 mg/100 g fresh weight. All three cultivars of hardy kiwifruits had protective effects on neuronal PC-12 and SHSY5Y cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide by increasing cell viability and reducing intracellular oxidative stress. Furthermore, the hardy kiwifruits inhibited acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Collectively, these results suggest that hardy kiwifruits rich in antioxidants like phenolics and vitamin C have good potential as functional materials in neuroprotective applications.

abstract={BACKGROUND: The Bergenia species are perennial herbs native to central Asia, and one of the most promising medicinal plants of the family Saxifragaceae which are popularly known as 'Pashanbheda'. The aim of this study was to evaluate antioxidant and α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, and cholinesterases inhibition potential of Bergenia pacumbis of Nepali origin collected from the Karnali region of Nepal. METHODS: The sequential crude extracts were made in hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water. Antioxidant activities were analyzed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay. The α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition were analyzed by the 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA), p-Nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG), 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB), l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide (AAAPVN), acetylthiocholine, and butyrylcholine as a respective substrate. The major metabolites were identified by high performance liquid chromatography with electron spray ionization- quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) profiling. RESULTS: Our results revealed the great antioxidant ability of crude extract of B. pacumbis in ethyl acetate extract against both DPPH (IC50 = 30.14 ± 0.14 μg/mL) and ABTS (IC50 = 17.38 ± 1.12 μg/mL). However, the crude methanol extract of B. pacumbis showed the comparable enzymes inhibitions with standard drugs; α-amylase (IC50 = 14.03 ± 0.04 μg/mL), α-glucosidase (IC50 = 0.29 ± 0.00 μg/mL), lipase (IC50 = 67.26 ± 0.17 μg/mL), tyrosinase (IC50 = 58.25 ± 1.63 μg/mL), elastase (IC50 = 74.00 ± 3.03 μg/mL), acetylcholinesterase (IC50 = 31.52 ± 0.58 μg/mL), and butyrylcholinesterase (IC50 = 11.69 ± 0.14 μg/mL). On the basis of HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS profiling of metabolites, we identified major compounds such as Bergenin, Catechin, Arbutin, Gallic acid, Protocatechuic acid, Syringic acid, Hyperoside, Afzelechin, Methyl gallate, Paashaanolactone, Astilbin, Quercetin, Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, Diosmetin, Phloretin, and Morin in methanol extract which has reported beneficial bioactivities. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a plethora of scientific evidence that the crude extracts of B. pacumbis from Nepalese origin in different extracting solvents have shown significant potential on inhibiting free radicals as well as enzymes involved in digestion, skin related problems, and neurological disorders compared with the commercially available drugs.},

abstract={The accurate and reproducible detection and description of thermodynamic states in computational data is a nontrivial problem, particularly when the number of states is unknown a priori and for large, flexible chemical systems and complexes. To this end, we report a novel clustering protocol that combines high-resolution structural representation, brute-force repeat clustering, and optimization of clustering statistics to reproducibly identify the number of clusters present in a data set (k) for simulated ensembles of butyrylcholinesterase in complex with two previously studied organophosphate inhibitors. Each structure within our simulated ensembles was depicted as a high-dimensionality vector with components defined by specific protein-inhibitor contacts at the chemical group level and the magnitudes of these components defined by their respective extents of pair-wise atomic contact, thus allowing for algorithmic differentiation between varying degrees of interaction. These surface-weighted interaction fingerprints were tabulated for each of over 1 million structures from more than 100 μs of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation per complex and used as the input for repetitive k-means clustering. Minimization of cluster population variance and range afforded accurate and reproducible identification of k, thereby allowing for the characterization of discrete binding modes from molecular simulation data in the form of contact tables that concisely encapsulate the observed intermolecular contact motifs. While the protocol presented herein to determine k and achieve non-heuristic clustering is demonstrated on data from massive atomistic simulation, our approach is generalizable to other data types and clustering algorithms, and is tractable with limited computational resources.

abstract={An increasing number of patients are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD); thus, the need for a method to detect AD early and sensitively has become urgent, and the demand for an intelligent analytical platform is growing year by year. Abnormal levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are known to be indicative of AD. In this work, a novel conjugated polythiophene (CP) compound was successfully combined with CdTe quantum dots (QDs) to improve their selectivity and sensitivity. The QDs successfully enabled the detection of low concentrations of AChE by turning on the fluorescence of the CdTe/CP via the interaction between CP and thiocholine produced by ATCh hydrolysis and aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE). Under optimal conditions, we reached a low detection limit of 0.14 U L-1, which is 7.9 times lower than that of pristine QDs. More importantly, an efficient, inexpensive, and disposable paper-based platform, which allows the efficient visual detection of AChE activity via the color variation of CdTe/CP, was designed. Moreover, the accuracy of the method was demonstrated by conducting a recovery test in human serum, in which the recoveries reached 107% and 110%, proving that CdTe/CP has considerable potential to be used for analyzing real biological samples. The advantages of this method are its simplicity, fast detection capability, affordability, and the fact that it can be used for on-site detection of AChE activity. Furthermore, it has certain guiding significance for detecting AD. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. To fight the disease, natural products, including mulberry, with antioxidant activities and inhibitory activities against key enzymes (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1)) are of interest. However, even in the same cultivars, mulberry trees grown in different populated locations might possess disparate amounts of phytochemical profiles, leading to dissimilar health properties, which cause problems when comparing different cultivars of mulberry. Therefore, this study aimed to comparatively investigate the phytochemicals, antioxidant activities, and inhibitory activities against AChE, BChE, and BACE-1, of twenty-seven Morus spp. cultivated in the same planting area in Thailand. The results suggested that Morus fruit samples were rich in phenolics, especially cyanidin, kuromanin, and keracyanin. Besides, the aqueous Morus fruit extracts exhibited antioxidant activities, both in single electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms, while strong inhibitory activities against AD key enzymes were observed. Interestingly, among the twenty-seven Morus spp., Morus sp. code SKSM 810191 with high phytochemicals, antioxidant activities and in vitro anti-AD properties is a promising cultivar for further developed as a potential mulberry resource with health benefits against AD.},

abstract={The inverse correlation observed between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer has prompted us to look for cholinesterase-inhibiting activity in phenothiazine derivatives that possess anticancer properties. With the use of in silico and in vitro screening methods, our study found a new biological activity in anticancer polycyclic, tricyclic, and tetracyclic compounds. The virtual screening of a library of 120 ligands, which are the derivatives of azaphenothiazine, led to the identification of 25 compounds that can act as potential inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Biological assays revealed the presence of selective inhibitors of eeAChE (electric eel AChE) or eqBuChE (equine serum BuChE) and nonselective inhibitors of both enzymes among the tested compounds. Their potencies against eeAChE were in a submicromolar-to-micromolar range with IC50 values from 0.78 to 19.32 μM, while their IC50 values against eqBuChE ranged from 0.46 to 10.38 μM. The most potent among the compounds tested was the tetracyclic derivative, 6-(4-diethylaminobut-2-ynyl)-9-methylthioquinobenzothiazine 24, which was capable of inhibiting both enzymes. 9-Fluoro-6-(1-piperidylethyl)quinobenzothiazine 23 was found to act as a selective inhibitor of eqBuChE with an IC50 value of 0.46 μM. Compounds with such a dual antitumor and cholinesterase-inhibitory activity can be considered as a valuable combination for the treatment of both cancer and AD prevention. The results presented in this study might open new directions of research on the group of tricyclic phenothiazine derivatives.},

abstract={Trypanosoma cruzi infection triggers an intense production of pro-inflammatory cytokines mediated by T helper 1 lymphocytes, inducing the anti-inflammatory reflex of acetylcholine (ACh). The ACh concentration modulation is associated to the two major esterases, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). AChE H353N protein polymorphism is related to low Chagas chronic disease prognostic. In order to evaluate the correlation of plasmatic BuChE concentration and the presence of AChE H353N polymorphism in Chagas disease patients and healthy individuals, we studied two groups of individuals, one of 61 Chagas disease patients and another of 74 healthy individuals. Plasma concentration of BuChE was measured by the chemiluminescent method and AChE H353N polymorphism was investigated by PCR-RFLP and sequencing of the respective encoding AChE gene fragment. The BuChE concentration was statistically higher in Chagas disease patients, with no AChE genotype significant influence. AChE genotypes YT*A/YT*A, YT*A/YT*B and YT*B/YT*B, respectively, were expressed in 53 (86.88%), 7 (11.46%) and one (1.64%) chagasic patients, and in 68 (91.89%), 6 (8.10%) and none healthy individuals. BuChE activity may represent an important marker for chronic Chagas disease inflammatory process and prognostic.

abstract={Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is a stoichiometric bioscavenger that protects from the toxicity of nerve agents. Non-human primates are suitable models for toxicity studies that cannot be performed in humans. We evaluated the biochemical properties of native macaque (MaBChE) tetramers, compared to recombinant MaBChE monomers, PEGylated recombinant MaBChE tetramers and monomers, and native HuBChE tetramers. Km and kcat values for butyrylthiocholine were independent of subunit assembly status. The Km for all forms of MaBChE was about 70 μM, compared to 13 μM for HuBChE. The kcat was about 100,000 min−1 for MaBChE and 30,000 min−1 for HuBChE. The reversible inhibitor ethopropazine had similar Ki values of 0.05 μM for all MaBChE forms and HuBChE. The bimolecular rate constant, ki, for inhibition by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an analog of sarin, was 2.2 to 2.5 × 107 M−1 min−1 for all MaBChE forms and for HuBChE. A major difference between MaBChE and HuBChE was the rate of reactivation by 2-PAM. The second order rate constant for reactivation of DFP-inhibited MaBChE by 2-PAM was 1.4 M−1 min−1, but was 380 fold faster for DFP-inhibited HuBChE (kr 531 M−1 min−1). The acyl pocket of MaBChE has Leu285 in place of Pro285 in HuBChE. The reactivation rate of DFP-inhibited HuBChE mutant P285L by 2-PAM was reduced 5.8-fold (kr 92 M−1 min−1) indicating that P285 determines whether 2-PAM binds in an orientation that favors release of diisopropylphosphate. DFP-inhibited MaBChE treated with 0.2 M 2-PAM recovered 10% of its original activity, whereas DFP-inhibited HuBChE recovered 80% activity. It was concluded that the biochemical properties of MaBChE are similar to those of HuBChE except for the reactivation of DFP-inhibited BChE. © 2020},

abstract={Multitarget molecules are considered as an effective way for the treatment of AD, instead of the classic one-drug-one-target strategy because of the multifactorial nature of AD. A variety of studies indicate that several enzymes inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of AD, including acetylcholinesterase (AchE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Various substituted quinoxaline-hydrazone derivatives were synthesized, and their activity in vitro were investigated, including AChE/BuChE inhibitory activity and MAOA/B inhibitory activity. Based on the experimental results, compound 5l exhibited good inhibitory potency on both AchE (IC50 = 0.028 ± 0.001 μM) and monoamine oxidase B (IC50 = 0.046 ± 0.002 μM). Molecular modeling studies showed that 5l could bind to the active site of AChE and MAO-B.

Soluble solid concentration (SSC) and pH increased, and titratable acidity (TA) and firmness decreased as the blueberries matured. The ripe blueberry fruits showed a higher SSC/TA ratio than the unripe fruits. Although total anthocyanin, flavonoids, phenolics content, and antioxidant activity were higher in ripe blueberries than in unripe fruit, the unripe fruit had higher acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition activities than ripe fruit in all cultivars. Total antioxidant activity was highly correlated with total flavonoids and phenolics. The relationships between the total antioxidant activity and the AChE or BChE inhibitory activity are negative. There were several physicochemical quality and antioxidant activity differences in blueberries, depending on the cultivar and the maturity at harvest.

abstract={Progesterone is a steroidal hormone that has been described with pathogenic features of brain dysfunction, realized with advanced age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, sixteen nitrogenous derivatives of progesterone which we previously synthesized have been used for Alzheimer targets. The progesterone derivatives (1–16) were screened for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory potentials in a dose-dependent manner. All the compounds exhibited overwhelming AChE inhibitions, with IC50 values ranging from 14.40 to 40.37 μM. Similarly, the BChE inhibitory potentials of our compounds were also dominant with IC50values between 20.08 and 46.84 μM. In comparison to our compounds, the standard drug galantamine attain IC50 values of 12.03 and 18.20 μM against AChE and BChE respectively. Molecular docking studies suggested that the compounds exerted their inhibitory activity by binding to the active site of the enzyme. The cholinergic system plays an important role in the regulation of learning and memory processes and has been a major target for the design of anti-Alzheimer's drugs. Therefore, these nitrogen-containing progesterone derivatives will be of potential interest to researchers working in AD for developing new drugs or chemical tools to study the disease. © 2020},

abstract={Aims: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) have been associated with risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS). Our objective was to evaluate the effect of nicotinamide (NAM) on the activities, expression and protein content of cholinesterases in a MetS model. Main methods: MetS was induced in male rats administrating 40% fructose to the drinking water for 16 weeks. Additionally, from 5th week onward, the carbohydrate solution was replaced by NAM, at several concentrations for 5 h each morning for the next 12 weeks. In the 15th week, the glucose tolerance test was conducted, and blood pressure was measured. After the treatment period had concluded, the biochemical profile; oxidant stress; proinflammatory markers; and the activity, quantity and expression of cholinesterases were evaluated, and molecular docking analysis was performed. Key findings: The MetS group showed anthropometric, hemodynamic and biochemical alterations and increased cholinesterase activity, inflammation and stress markers. In the liver, cholinesterase activity and mRNA, free fatty acid, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels were increased, while reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased. NAM partially or totally decreased risk factors for MetS, markers of stress and inflammation, and the activity (serum and liver) and expression (liver) of cholinesterases. Molecular docking analysis showed that NAM has a greater affinity for cholinesterases than acetylcholine (ACh), suggesting NAM as an inhibitor of cholinesterases. Significance: Supplementation with 40% fructose induced MetS, which increased the activity and expression of cholinesterases, oxidative stress and the inflammation. NAM attenuated these MetS-induced alterations and changes in cholinesterases. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment and loss of immediate memory resulting from neuronal death in different brain areas, mainly those producing acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors improve cognitive function, delay mental deterioration, and reduce other symptoms. Despite being the cornerstone for treating mild–moderate AD, these compounds are only palliative agents and often have severe adverse effects. Recently, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) has been found to be involved in AD. The aim of this study was to synthesize a series of six phthalimides with structural relationship with monoamines and evaluate them in vitro and in silico as AChE and BuChE inhibitors. In addition, a modified version of the Bonting and Featherstone method for determining AChE activity was adapted for the assessment of BuChE activity. Results: Six molecules (dioxoisoindolines A–F) were synthesized in good yields using a green chemistry approach. Dioxoisoindolines E and F were more active for AChE, with a Ki of 232 and 193 µM, respectively. Contrarily, dioxoisoindolines C and D showed up to fivefold greater selectivity for BuChE than AchE, with a Ki of 200 and 100 µM, respectively. The competitive inhibitory activity of the latter two molecules was similar to that of the reference compounds. Molecular docking demonstrated the participation of carbonyl carbons and aromatic rings in the high affinity of dioxoisoindoles for cholinesterases. Conclusion: The modified version of the Bonting and Featherstone method was successfully adapted to quantify BuChE activity. Dioxoisoindolines C and D displayed greater inhibition of BuChE versus AChE, with good inhibition of both enzymes. Thus, they are promising lead compounds for developing new BuChE/AChE inhibitors.

abstract={Objectives: To describe the relationships between anticholinergic drug exposure, cholinesterase enzyme activity, inflammation, and the development of postoperative delirium in children. Design: Single-center prospective cohort study. Setting: Twenty-Two bed PICU in a tertiary-care academic medical center in Germany. Patients: A consecutive cohort of children admitted after major elective surgery. Interventions: Children were screened for delirium bid over 5 consecutive postoperative days. Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase plasma activity levels were measured prior to surgery and once daily during the 5 day study period. Number of anticholinergic drugs and Anticholinergic Drug Scale score were calculated for each patient. Measurements and Main Results: Ninety-Three children (age range, 0-17 yr) were included. The number of anticholinergic drugs as well as the Anticholinergic Drug Scale score were significantly correlated with development of postoperative delirium, independently of disease severity. Baseline cholinesterase enzyme levels did not differ between patients who did and did not develop postoperative delirium. Butyrylcholinesterase levels, but not acetylcholinesterase levels, dropped by 33% postoperatively, independent of the presence of postoperative delirium. Postoperative butyrylcholinesterase levels were inversely related to number of anticholinergic drugs, Anticholinergic Drug Scale score, and C-reactive protein levels. Conclusions: Anticholinergic drug exposure was related to development of postoperative delirium in this cohort, with demonstration of a dose-response relationship. As there are alternative options available for many of these medications, it may be reasonable to avoid anticholinergic exposure in the PICU whenever possible. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

abstract={Fibigia clypeata (L.) Medik. is a poorly studied plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family, and usually used as cress in the salads. The current investigation aimed at assessing the antioxidant potential and inhibitory activity of ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous extracts of F. clypeata against key enzymes targeted in the management of type II diabetes (α-amylase and α- glucosidase), Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase), and skin hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase). Cytotoxicity of the extracts was also determined using normal VERO and cancer FaDu and SCC-25 cell lines. Besides, LC-MS was employed to investigate the detailed phytochemical profiles of the extracts. The methanol extract showed potent enzyme inhibitory activity (4.87 mg galantamine equivalent/g, 3.52 mg galantamine equivalent/g, 126.80 mg kojic acid equivalent/g, and 24.68 mg acarbose equivalent/g, for acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, and α-glucosidase, respectively) and antioxidant potential (96.52, 109.10, 154.02, and 104.85 mg trolox equivalent/g, for DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC, and FRAP assays, respectively). Interestingly, caffeic acid-O-hexoside derivative, caffeyl alcohol O-glucopyranoside, and ferulic acid derivative were identified in all extracts. F. clypeata extracts showed no cytotoxicity towards VERO cell line and a weak cytotoxic potential against FaDu and SCC-25 cell lines. Interesting scientific evidence gathered from the present study support further investigation on F. clypeata in the view of designing and developing a novel therapeutic agent for the management of Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, skin hyperpigmentation problems, as well as cancer. © 2020 by the authors.},

Obtained anti-cholinesterase activities demonstrated that all the title compounds exhibited excellent inhibition against BuChE and moderate inhibitory activity toward AChE in comparison to standard cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. For example, compound 8e exhibited about 49-fold higher inhibitory activity than donepezil (IC50 = 3.2 ± 0.3 μM) against BuChE. This compound inhibited BuChE via a mixed-type inhibition mode. This finding demonstrated that compound 8e in addition to catalytic anionic site (CAS) can also interact with the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of BuChE.

abstract={The chemical composition of the essential oil from Salvia rosmarinus Spenn. collected in Calabrian Ionian (R1) and Tyrrhenian (R2) coast (Southern Italy) was examined by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Essential oils are mainly characterized by monoterpene hydrocarbons (39.32–40.70%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (36.08-39.47%). The 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, camphor, and trans-caryophyllene are the most representative compounds. S. rosmarinus essential oils were investigated for their antioxidant activity by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity assays were used to screen the neuroprotective effects of S. rosmarinus. R2 showed the highest antioxidant potential as confirmed by relative antioxidant capacity index (RACI) and exhibited a selective activity against AChE (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50, value of 41.86 µg/mL). These results suggest S. rosmarinus essential oil as a potential source of bioactive compounds. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Organophosphate (OP) compounds constitute a class of highly toxic molecules, characterized by irreversible cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition. Being either pesticides or chemical warfare agents, they present a major health issue in some countries, as well as a terrorist or military threat. Prompted by the need for suitable animal models to test novel medical countermeasures, we developed a new convulsive mouse model of OP poisoning using diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Using electrocorticography (ECoG), we analyzed seizure and status epilepticus (SE) occurrences, as well as relative power of ECoG frequency band modifications after DFP injection in male Swiss mice. Next, we investigated DFP effect on ChE inhibition. Histological changes on neuronal activity and neuronal damage were examined by c-Fos immunolabeling and Fluoro-Jade C staining. We showed that mice exposed to DFP presented electrocorticographic seizures that rapidly progressed to SE within 20 minutes. Lasting >8 hours, DFP-induced SE was associated with major power spectrum modifications in seizing DFP animals compared to control animals. Seizures and SE development were concomitant with profound ChE inhibition and induced massive neuronal degeneration. Presenting all hallmarks of convulsive OP poisoning, we showed that our mouse model is valuable for studying pathophysiological mechanisms and preclinical testing of newly available therapeutic molecules. © 2020 International League Against Epilepsy},

abstract={Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although the etiology of MS is still unknown, both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Acetylcholine participates in the modulation of central and peripheral inflammation. The cells of the immune system, as well as microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes express cholinergic markers and receptors of muscarinic and nicotinic type. The role played by acetylcholine in MS has been recently investigated. In the present review, we summarize the evidence indicating the cholinergic dysfunction in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS patients and in the brains of the MS animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The correlation between the increased activity of the cholinergic hydrolyzing enzymes acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, the reduced levels of acetylcholine and the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines production were recently described in immune cells of MS patients. Moreover, the genetic polymorphisms for both hydrolyzing enzymes and the possible correlation with the altered levels of their enzymatic activity have been also reported. Finally, the changes in cholinergic markers expression in the central nervous system of EAE mice in peak and chronic phases suggest the involvement of the acetylcholine also in neuro-inflammatory processes. © 2020 by the authors.},

Additionally, 3c (IC50 for EeAChE = 25 nM and IC50 for EqBuChE = 123 nM) displayed dual cholinesterase inhibitory activity and was the most active compound against acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Active compound 3c was also tested for the ability to inhibit Aβ aggregation. Theoretical physicochemical properties of the compounds were calculated using ACD Labs Percepta and Chemaxon. A Lineweaver–Burk plot and docking study showed that 3c targeted both the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. Moreover, 3c appears to possess neuroprotective activity and could be considered a free-radical scavenger. In addition, 3c did not cause DNA damage and was found to be less toxic than tacrine after oral administration; it also demonstrated little inhibitory activity towards hyaluronidase (HYAL), which may indicate that it possesses anti-inflammatory properties. The screening for new in vivo interactions between 3c and known receptors was realized by yeast three-hybrid technology (Y3H). © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The therapeutic effect of phenolics on neurodegenerative diseases has been attributed to their potent antioxidant properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective activities of vanillin and vanillic acid were investigated in Fe2+- induced oxidative toxicity in brain tissues by investigating their therapeutic effects on oxidative imbalance, cholinergic and nucleotide-hydrolyzing enzymes activities, dysregulated metabolic pathways. Their cytotoxicity was investigated in hippocampal neuronal cell lines (HT22). The reduced glutathione level, SOD and catalase activities were ameliorated in tissues treated with the phenolics, with concomitant depletion of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. They inhibited acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities, while concomitantly elevated ATPase activity. Treatment with vanillin led to restoration of oxidative-depleted metabolites and reactivation of the pentose phosphate and purine metabolism pathways, with concomitant activation of pathways for histidine and selenoamino metabolisms. While vanillic acid restored and reactivated oxidative-depleted metabolites and pathways but did not activate any additional pathway. Both phenolics portrayed good binding affinity for catalase, with vanillic acid having the higher binding energy of −7.0 kcal/mol. Both phenolics were not cytotoxic on HT22 cells, and their toxicity class were predicted to be 4. Only vanillin was predicted to be permeable across the blood brain barrier (BBB). These results insinuate that vanillin and vanillic acid confer a neuroprotective effect on oxidative brain damage, when vanillin being the most potent. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Phytochemical investigations of Oxalis corniculata L. shown the existence of biologically active secondary metabolites like phenols, flavanoids, alkaloids, tannins, triterpenes, sterols, and volatile oils. In this work, ethanolic extract of Oxalis corniculata L. was prepared to explore the carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterase inhibitory activities against epilepsy and anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) potential. Upon fractionation, chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions showed high phenolic (168.56 and 171.11 μg ascorbic acid/g extract) and flavonoid contents (115.72 and 99.35 μg (+)-catechin/g extract), respectively and were the most active ones against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and carbonic anhydrase inhibition. The bioactivity-guided isolation from chloroform and ethyl acetate extract of Oxalis corniculata afforded nine flavonoids. The newly isolated flavonoid (1) and eight source compounds 2–9 screened by cholinesterase (AChE and BChE) and carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II) inhibitory assays. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition rate for compounds 1–9 ranged 65.21–90.82 with the IC50 17.11–25.18, compared with reference acetazolamide. Cholinesterase (AChE and BChE) inhibitory potential (49.52 and 29.12 μg/mL) of newly isolated compound 1 whereas compounds 3, 5, 8 and 9 showed considerable significant inhibition potential using standard inhibitor serine. Moreover, the ground state geometries of all the nine compounds along with positive drugs were optimized by Density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/TZ2P level to explore the electronic properties and active sites. The effect of substituents on the molecular descriptors, frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential and Hirshfeld charges was explored. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Diabetes mellitus is associated with perturbations in brain biochemical parameters associated with dementia. This study aimed at comparing the effect of metformin and metformin/donepezil combination on oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation in the brain of diabetic Wistar rats. Methods: Diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg streptozotocin after administration of 10% fructose for 14 days. Animals were randomly assigned to four groups of five animals each. Group 1 was the normal control and received only distilled water. Groups 2 and 3 were diabetic rats treated with metformin/donepezil combination and metformin only respectively, while group 4 was diabetic control. Treatment lasted for 21 days after confirmation of diabetes. Activities of acetylcholinesterase (AchE), butyrylcholinesterase (BchE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase were evaluated in the brain of diabetic rats. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to estimate brain levels of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) malondialdehyde and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), while expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers – glucose regulated protein-78 (GRP78), activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was determined using real-time PCR in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Results: Treatment with metformin/donepezil combination significantly reduced the activities of AchE, BchE as well as levels of malondialdehyde, TNF-α and IL-6, while the activities of SOD, GPx and catalase were significantly increased in the brain. Moreover, expression of ER stress markers was attenuated in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Metformin/donepezil combination appeared more efficacious than metformin only and could be considered for managing diabetes-associated dementia. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={A total of 20 derivatives (1-20) of the crinane-type alkaloid ambelline were synthesized. These semisynthetic derivatives were assessed for their potency to inhibit both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE).

All compounds should be able to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) according to the obtained results. A total of 7 aromatic derivatives (5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 16) with different substitution patterns showed inhibitory potency against human serum BuChE (IC50 &lt; 5 μM), highlighting the three top-ranked compounds as follows: 11-O-(1-naphthoyl)ambelline (16), 11-O-(2-methylbenzoyl)ambelline (6), and 11-O-(2-methoxybenzoyl)ambelline (9) with IC50 values of 0.10 ± 0.01, 0.28 ± 0.02, and 0.43 ± 0.04 μM, respectively. Notably, derivatives 6, 7, 9, and 16 displayed selective human BuChE (hBuChE) inhibition profiles with a selectivity index &gt; 100. The in vitro results were supported by computational studies predicting plausible binding modes of the compounds in the active sites of hBuChE.

abstract={Synthesis of a compound with balanced bioactivities against a specific target is always a challenging task. In this study, a novel compound (1) has been synthesized by combination of flurbiprofen and isoniazide and shows ~2.5 times enhanced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity and ~1.7 times improved butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition activity compared to flurbiprofen and a standard drug (i.e.physostigmine). A comparative AutoDock study has been performed, based on the optimized structure, by the DFT/B3LYP method, which confirmed that compound (1) is more active against AChE and BuChE, with calculated binding energies of -12.9 kcal mol-1and -9.8 kcal mol-1respectively as compared to flurbiprofen and an eserine (physostigmine) standard for which the binding energy was calculated to be -10.1 kcal mol-1and -8.9 kcal mol-1, respectively. A mixed mode of inhibition of AChE and BuChE with compound1was confirmed by Lineweaver-Burk plots. AChE and BuChE inhibition activity alongside docking results suggests that compound (1) could be used for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, compound (1) also exhibit better a-chymotrypsin activity compared to flurbiprofen. Furthermore,in vitroandin vivoanalysis confirmed that compound (1) exhibit more activity and less toxicity than the parent compounds. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.},

abstract={Recently, the use of atomic spectrometry (AS) for biochemical analysis has attracted considerable attention due to its high sensitivity, selectivity and anti-interference ability. In this work, we conducted a detailed study on a phenomenon of thiol inhibition of mercury (Hg2+) cold vapor generation (CVG) and found L-cysteine (L-Cys), glutathione (GSH), dithiothreitol, N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, β-mercaptoethanol, and NaI can inhibit the CVG of Hg2+, while EDTA has no inhibitory effect. Furthermore, changing the content of –SH can effectively adjust the CVG atomic fluorescence spectrometer (CVG-AFS) signal of Hg2+. As as a consequence, an AS-based homogeneous bioassay was constructed by adjusting the oxidation ratio and production quantity of –SH in the system. The quantitative analysis of the system was demonstrated by using AFS as a representative detector. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glucose were used as representative analytes for the validation of Hg2+ atomic fluorescence signal turn-off strategy, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) as well as parathion (organophosphorus pesticides, OPs) as utilized as representative targets for the signal turn-on strategy. Under optimal experimental conditions, the homogeneous CVG-AFS sensor can be successfully used to detect 3 μM H2O2, 30 μM glucose, 0.25 U/L BChE, and 0.4 μg/mL parathion. In addition, the detection results of glucose and BChE in human serum samples agreed well with those obtained by using glucometer and kit, showing the promising potential of this method for practical applications. Therefore, this work provides a perspective for the construction of AS-based homogeneous bioassays and shows great potential for the detection of biomarkers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors modulate acetylcholine hydrolysis and hence play a key role in determining the cholinergic tone and in implementing its impact on the cholinergic blockade of inflammatory processes. Such inhibitors may include rapidly acting small molecule AChE-blocking drugs and poisonous anti-AChE insecticides or war agent inhibitors which penetrate both body and brain. Notably, traumatized patients may be hyper-sensitized to anti-AChEs due to their impaired cholinergic tone, higher levels of circulation pro-inflammatory cytokines and exacerbated peripheral inflammatory responses. Those largely depend on the innate-immune system yet reach the brain via vagus pathways and/or disrupted blood-brain-barrier. Other regulators of the neuro-inflammatory cascade are AChE-targeted microRNAs (miRs) and synthetic chemically protected oligonucleotide blockers thereof, whose size prevents direct brain penetrance. Nevertheless, these larger molecules may exert parallel albeit slower inflammatory regulating effects on brain and body tissues. Additionally, oligonucleotide aptamers interacting with innate immune Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) may control inflammation through diverse routes and in different rates. Such aptamers may compete with the action of both small molecule inhibitors and AChE-inhibiting miRs in peripheral tissues including muscle and intestine. However, rapid adaptation processes, visualized in neuromuscular junctions enable murine survival under otherwise lethal anti-cholinesterase exposure; and both miR inhibitors and TLR-modulating aptamers may exert body-brain signals protecting experimental mice from acute inflammation. The complex variety of AChE inhibiting molecules identifies diverse body-brain communication pathways which may rapidly induce long-lasting central reactions to peripheral stressful and inflammatory insults in both mice and men. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In vitro biological evaluation demonstrated that compound 4f was the best pseudo-irreversible hBChE (human butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.97 μM 4f was a potent selective MAO-B (monoamine oxidase-B) inhibitor (IC50 = 5.3 μM), and could inhibit (58.2%) and disaggregate (43.3%) self-mediated Aβ aggregation. 4f also could reduce the levels of pathological tau and APP clearance, and displayed a wide safe range hepatotoxicity on LO2 cells. The in vivo studies revealed that 4f exhibited fascinating dyskinesia recovery rate and response efficiency on AlCl3-mediated zebrafish, and demonstrated significant protective effect on vascular injury caused by Aβ1-40. PET-CT imaging demonstrated that [11C]4f exhibited high BBB penetration (especially could reach to hippocampus and striatum of brain) and had a fast brain uptake after intravenous bolus injection. Furthermore, compound 4f could improve scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment. Further, the metabolism in vitro of 4f was also investigated, and presented 3 metabolites in rat liver microsome metabolism, 4 metabolites in human liver microsome, and 4 metabolites in rat intestinal flora, providing previous data for the preclinical study.

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors (AChEIs) still remain the leading therapeutic options for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive deficits associated with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The search for new AChEIs benefits from wellestablished knowledge of the molecular interactions of selective AChEIs, such as donepezil and related dual binding site inhibitors. Starting from a previously disclosed coumarin-based inhibitor (±)-cis-1, active as racemate in the nanomolar range toward AChE, we proceeded on a double track by (i) achieving chiral resolution of the enantiomers of 1 by HPLC and (ii) preparing two close achiral analogues of 1, i.e., compounds 4 and 6. An eudismic ratio as high as 20 was observed for the (-) enantiomer of cis-1. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex between the (-)-cis-1 eutomer (coded as MC1420) and T. californica AChE was determined at 2.8 Å, and docking calculation results suggested that the eutomer in (1R,3S) absolute configuration should be energetically more favored in binding the enzyme than the eutomer in (1S,3R) configuration. The achiral analogues 4 and 6 were less effective in inhibiting AChE compared to (±)-cis-1, but interestingly butylamide 4 emerged as a potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). © 2020 American Chemical Society.

abstract={The biological, chemical, and in silico properties of methanol and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of Alhagi maurorum roots with respect to the antioxidant, enzyme inhibition, and phytochemical composition were evaluated. Total bioactive contents were determined spectrophotometrically, and the individual secondary metabolites composition was assessed via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis. Antioxidant capacities were evaluated using a panoply of assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2’-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric reducing antioxidant power (CUPRAC), phosphomolybdenum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and metal chelating activity (MCA)). The enzyme inhibition potential was studied against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-amylase, α-glucosidase, tyrosinase, urease and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. The methanol extract was found to contain higher total phenolic (105.91 mg GAE/g extract) and flavonoid (2.27 mg RE/g extract) contents which can be correlated to its more substantial antioxidant potential as well as AChE, BChE, tyrosinase and α-glucosidase inhibition. However, the DCM extract was the most effective against α-amylase (1.86 mmol ACAE/g extract) enzyme inhibition. The UHPLC-MS analysis of methanol extract identified the tentative presence of a total of 18 secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, saponins, phenolic and terpenoid derivatives. Three compounds named emmotin A, luteolin 5,3’-dimethyl ether, and preferrugone were further investigated for their in silico molecular docking studies against the tested enzymes. The selected compounds were found to have higher binding interaction with AChE followed by BChE, α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and tyrosinase. The results of the present study have demonstrated A. mauroram to be considered as a lead source of natural antioxidant and enzyme inhibitor compounds. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In contrast to these failures, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) inhibitors slow the clinical progression of the disease and randomized, placebo-controlled trials in prodromal and mild to moderate AD patients have shown AChE inhibitor anti-neurodegenerative benefits in the cortex, hippocampus, and basal forebrain. CNS neurodegeneration and atrophy are now recognized as biomarkers of AD according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria and recent evidence shows that these markers are among the earliest signs of prodromal AD, before the appearance of amyloid. The current AChE inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) have short-acting mechanisms of action that result in dose-limiting toxicity and inadequate efficacy. Irreversible AChE inhibitors, with a long-acting mechanism of action, are inherently CNS selective and can more than double CNS AChE inhibition possible with short-acting inhibitors. Irreversible AChE inhibitors open the door to high-level CNS AChE inhibition and improved anti-neurodegenerative benefits that may be an important part of future treatments to more effectively prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression of AD. © 2020 by the author.

abstract={Thirteen known (1–12 and 16) and three previously undescribed Amaryllidaceae alkaloids of belladine structural type, named carltonine A-C (13–15), were isolated from bulbs of Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton (Amaryllidaceae) by standard chromatographic methods. Compounds isolated in sufficient amounts, and not tested previously, were evaluated for their in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE; E.C. 3.1.1.7), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; E.C. 3.1.1.8) and prolyl oligopeptidase (POP; E.C. 3.4.21.26) inhibition activities. Significant human BuChE (hBUChE) inhibitory activity was demonstrated by newly described alkaloids carltonine A (13) and carltonine B (14) with IC50 values of 913 ± 20 nM and 31 ± 1 nM, respectively. Both compounds displayed a selective inhibition pattern for hBuChE with an outstanding selectivity profile over AChE inhibition, higher than 100. The in vitro data were further supported by in silico studies of the active alkaloids 13 and 14 in the active site of hBuChE. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is considered a promising drug target as it plays an important role in the progression of late stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two compound libraries were selected and 64 124 amine containing moieties were screened using a hierarchical virtual screening protocol to discover new selective BuChE inhibitors. From these and subsequent docking experiments, 9-phenylacridinedione (9-PAD) was identified as a promising scaffold for selective inhibition of BuChE. Selected top dock scored 9-PADs were assayed and compounds 3 and 6 exhibited potent and highly selective human BuChE inhibition (IC50: 98 nM and 142 nM, respectively). Both molecules were also predicted to show sufficient brain permeability, not have any substantial toxicities, especially hepatotoxicity, and no significant in vitro cytotoxicity against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at concentrations up to 100 µM. These findings indicate that 9-PAD is a promising lead structure for the development of agents able to treat late stage AD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: The activity of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in blood reflects liver function and has recently been associated with systemic inflammatory response and tumor cachexia. As these conditions have been previously linked with pancreatic cancer (PC), the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of plasma BChE in PC. Methods: Data from 574 consecutive PC patients, treated between 2004 and 2018 at a single academic center, was evaluated. The primary endpoint was cancer-specific survival (CSS), analyzed by Kaplan–Meier curve, and both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional models. Results: BChE activity negatively correlated with other liver parameters (bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and C-reactive protein (CRP)), and positively correlated with albumin levels, respectively (p < 0.01). In univariate analysis, a low plasma BChE activity was a factor of poor CSS (hazard ratio: 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.129–1.754, p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, tumor stage, tumor grade, administration of chemotherapy, bilirubin levels and a low BChE activity (hazard ratio: 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.10–1.82; p = 0.006) were identified as independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: Decreased activity of BChE in blood plasma predicts shorter survival time in PC patients. Therefore, BChE might be helpful in additional stratification of patients into different prognostic risk groups. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Meldrum’s acid derivatives were facile synthesized by one-pot condensation process and characterized by NMR (1H, 13C, DEPT-90 and DEPT-135) and EI-MS. The synthesized compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and α-glucosidase enzymes. Interestingly, the derivative 3a showed potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, with the IC50 value equal to 2.1 mg/mL as compared to standard acarbose (IC50 = 4.7 mg/mL), whereas, in terms of BChE inhibitory activity investigation, the derivatives 3a and 3c showed novel results, with the IC50 values equal to 1.2 and 2.9 mg/mL, respectively, as compared to standard galantamine hydrobromide (IC50 = 4.7 mg/mL), making derivative 3a a dual inhibitor of both enzymes. Further, structure–activity relationship, comparative molecular docking analysis and the DNA–drug binding interaction were studied to investigate relationship between the chemical structure and its biological activity, inhibition of mechanism, interaction of compounds, DNA binding constant and Gibbs free energy. Structural insights into inhibitor binding to the α-glucosidase and BuChE revealed significant contribution of hydrophobic regions and significant residues of active sites. Comparative molecular docking studies showed that the residues of oxyanion hole, catalytic triad and hydrophobic pocket were actively engaged in interaction with the inhibitor. DNA binding constant was found in the order Kb 3e &gt; Kb 3c &gt; Kb 3a &gt; Kb 3b &gt; Kb 3d, while Gibbs free energy was found in the order ∆G 3e &gt; ∆G 3a &gt; ∆G 3b &gt; ∆G 3c &gt; ∆G 3d. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Based on structure analyses of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a series of 21 acridone glycosides were designed, synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their BChE and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. D-ribose derivative 6f exhibited the greatest inhibitory activity on BChE (IC50 = 6.95 μM), and was the most selective inhibitor of BChE with the IC50 ratio of AChE/BChE was 20.59. D-glucose and D-galactose derivatives 6a and 6b showed inhibitory activities against both AChE and BChE. Moreover, compounds 6a, 6b, 6f and 5t were found nontoxic on SHSY5Y neuroblastoma and HepG2 cell and exhibited remarkable neuroprotective activity. Besides, compound 6f showed mixed-type inhibition against BChE (Ki = 1.76 μM), which renders 6f a potential agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These novel acridone hybrids might be used as efficient probes to reveal the relationship between ligands and BChE and pave the way for developing selective BChE inhibitors to further study the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Based on the isosterism concept, we have designed and synthesized homologous N-alkyl-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]hydrazine-1-carboxamides (from C1 to C18) as potential antimicrobial agents and enzyme inhibitors. They were obtained from 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzohydrazide by three synthetic approaches and characterized by spectral methods. The derivatives were screened for their inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) via Ellman’s method. All the hydrazinecarboxamides revealed a moderate inhibition of both AChE and BuChE, with IC50 values of 27.04–106.75 µM and 58.01–277.48 µM, respectively. Some compounds exhibited lower IC50 for AChE than the clinically used drug rivastigmine. N-Tridecyl/pentadecyl-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl) benzoyl]hydrazine-1-carboxamides were identified as the most potent and selective inhibitors of AChE. For inhibition of BuChE, alkyl chain lengths from C5 to C7 are optimal substituents. Based on molecular docking study, the compounds may work as non-covalent inhibitors that are placed in a close proximity to the active site triad. The compounds were evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and nontuberculous mycobacteria (M. avium, M. kansasii). Reflecting these results, we prepared additional analogues of the most active carboxamide (n-hexyl derivative 2f). N-Hexyl-5-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-amine (4) exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations within this study (MIC ≥ 62.5 µM), however, this activity is mild. All the compounds avoided cytostatic properties on two eukaryotic cell lines (HepG2, MonoMac6). © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The compounds have shown considerable promise as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors. Although the inhibition of eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE) was weak, the inhibitions against equine BuChE (eqBuChE) and human BuChE (hBuChE) were more significant with a best inhibition against eqBuChE of 0.46 μM. In some cases, these molecules gave better inhibitions for hBuChE than eqBuChE. For greater insights into their mode of action, molecular docking studies were carried out, followed by STD-NMR validation. In addition, some of these compounds showed weak Aβ anti-aggregation activity.

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) mediate the degradation of acetylcholine (ACh), a primary neurotransmitter in the brain. Cholinergic deficiency occurs during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), resulting in widespread cognitive dysfunction and decline. We evaluated the potential effect of a natural cholinesterase inhibitor, zerumbone, using in vitro target enzyme assays, as well as in silico docking and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) simulation. Zerumbone showed a predominant cholinesterase inhibitory property with IC50 values of 2.74 ± 0.48 µM and 4.12 ± 0.42 µM for AChE and BChE, respectively; however, the modes of inhibition were different. Computational docking simulation indicated that Van der Waals interactions between zerumbone and both the cholinesterases were the main forces responsible for its inhibitory effects. Furthermore, zerumbone showed the best physicochemical properties for both bioavailability and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Together, in the present study, zerumbone was clearly identified as a unique dual AChE and BChE inhibitor with high permeability across the BBB, suggesting a strong potential for its physiological benefits and/or pharmacological efficacy in the prevention of AD. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Cola caricifolia (G.Don) K. Schum and Crotalaria retusa L. are important plants in African traditional medicine used against a plethora of human ailments. In this study, phytochemical characterization and enzyme inhibitory assays were performed to assess the potential usefulness of C. caricifolia and C. retusa leaves extracts as source of bioactive constituents for potential industrial applications. The flavonoid content of C. caricifolia (22.27 mg rutin equivalent (RE)/g) was significantly higher (p<0.05) than C. retusa (12.45 mg RE/g) methanol extract. Inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase were evaluated for all the extracts (ethyl acetate, methanol, and water), whereby the best activity recorded for the methanol extracts. Additionally, the methanol extracts of C. caricifolia and C. retusa showed significant antioxidant activity in the phosphomolybdenum, metal chelating, reducing power, and radical scavenging assays. Flavonoid glycosides and caffeoyl derivatives were the most abundant constituents in C. caricifolia. Crotalaria retusa contained several flavonoid glycosides with structures not described previously. One new compound, kaempferol-6-C-β-glucopyranoside-3-O-β-glucopyranosil-6-O-caffeoyl ester has been elucidated using spectroscopic method in the current study. Derivatives present in minor amount were tentatively identified as kaempferol glycosides. Overall phytochemical investigations allowed the identification of flavonoid O and C glycosides, caffeic acid derivatives, and phytosterols from both plant extracts while pyrrolizidine alkaloids were identified in C. retusa. Structural characteristics of the new isolated compounds along with the most abundant constituents of the two extracts were elucidated allowing the observation of some structural moieties related to the observed activity. These observations highlighted the potential use of these plants as a source of multi-directional biological agents that could lead to bioproducts development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The objective of this study is to determine essential oil, diterpenoid and phenolic contents of Sideritis hololeuca along with their biological activities. Phytol was found to be the main component of the essential oil. Seven known kaurane diterpenoids, siderol (140 mg, 0.16%, w/w), 7-acetoxy sideroxol (15 mg, 0.02%, w/w), eubol (6 mg, 0.01%, w/w), eubotriol (5 mg, 0.03%, w/w), 7-epicandicandiol (3 mg, 0.02%, w/w), ent-7α-acetoxy-18-hydroxykaur-16-ene (5 mg, 0.01%, w/w) and linearol [by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)] were determined from the species. Moreover, vanillin (21 mg, 0.10%, w/w), which was not isolated from any Sideritis species earlier, was isolated from an acetone extract of S. hololeuca. Quantitative amounts of some phenolic compounds in n-hexane, dichloromethane, acetone, methanol extracts and infusion and decoction of the plants were also investigated by LC-MS/MS. Antioxidant capacity and acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase inhibition effects of the species were evaluated. The extracts of methanol and infusion and decoction of species showed moderate butyrylcholinesterase inhibition activity. The highest inhibition was observed from the decoction of species. The Cu2+ reducing power of infusion was determined as 1.435 mmol TR g-1 © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.},

The antioxidant activity of these compounds was evaluated by eight complementary in vitro tests. The anticholinesterase activity (AChE, BChE) of these compounds were also evaluated. In addition, theoretical calculations of all compounds were investigated as corrosion inhibitors using density functional theory (DFT). The results revealed that 16 of these compounds exhibited high levels of antioxidant activities depending on the assay and that most compounds showed more potent inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Galanthamine, is the most known Amaryllidaceae alkaloid, which is currently being prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Narcissus L., a genus belonging to the same family, has been subjected to intensive research owing to its broad alkaloidal range. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate Narcissus tazetta L. in terms of its therapeutic potential in AD and to isolate Amaryllidaceae alkaloids with anticholinesterase activity. A qualitative determination of the alkaloidal contents of aerial parts and bulbs of the plant were carried out via Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analysis. Additionally, secondary metabolites were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the plant by means of chromatographic methods. The structural elucidation of isolated compounds was established by spectroscopic techniques. Determination of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of the isolated Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were accomplished using a microplate assay modified from Ellman's method. These compounds were also subjected to docking studies to determine the non-covalent interactions formed with the active site residues of cholinesterase enzymes. GC–MS monitoring on the profile of N. tazetta was resulted in the detection of 22 alkaloids. Isolation process on the plant has led to isolate four alkaloids belonging to three different skeleton types. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and MS findings verified that those compounds were identical with (−)-9-O-methylpseudolycorine, (−)-narcissidine, (−)-pancratinine-C and (+)-9-O-demethyl-2-α-hydroxyhomolycorine. Among those; 11-hydroxygalanthine and narcissidine have shown significant acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity based on our bioactivity results. It was observed that the docking scores were found close in general, when the docking scores of the isolated alkaloids calculated inside electric eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE) and Equus caballus butyrylcholinesterase (eqBuChE) were examined. Increased anti-acetylcholinesterase activity was observed in lycorine-type. This is the first report on the isolation of (−)-pancratinine-C from the genus Narcissus. Docking scores of all the compounds isolated from the title plant were agreeable with the bioactivity results. The evaluation of the results given in this study, reveals that this particular Turkish Narcissus species represents a promising source of bioactive alkaloids with intriguing chemical structures which may have the potential to be drug leads. © 2019},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive deficit. Various drug targets implicated in AD are β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, cholinesterase enzymes, and free radicals. Plants derived phytoconstituents provides a vast pool of diverse compounds as a source of novel drugs. In view of this, the Elettaria cardamomum L. Maton. extract and its active phytoconstituents alpha-terpinyl acetate were used to study the disease-modifying effects in AD. The present study successfully demonstrated for the first time the therapeutic potential of alpha-terpinyl acetate as it binds to multiple drug targets, resulting in inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzyme, reduced Aβ induced neurotoxicity, reduced hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, and anti-amyloidogenic property. In conclusion, alpha-terpinyl acetate can be used as a suitable lead to develop a molecule that might have multi-targeted directed ligand (MTDL) potential and disease amelioration effects in AD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The restoration of acetylcholine levels in the brain by inhibition of cholinesterases is currently the most successful therapeutic strategy to treat neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, tacrine has been largely investigated as a starting scaffold for the development of promising new anticholinesterases compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer’s disease. Here we present a series of compounds containing the tacrine nucleus connected with squaric moiety by a diaminoalkylene chain. The compounds were obtained through a simple and short synthetic route and showed high inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) within nanomolar IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration). The molecular modelling study showed that these compounds act as dual-binding inhibitors of AChE, interacting with both catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme’s binding cavity. The investigated compounds also demonstrated outstanding selectivity for AChE than in butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). These results evince these compounds as promising agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and a fuller synthetic scope jointly with complementary biological evaluations are currently under investigation in our laboratory. ©2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Química},

abstract={In order to develop multitarget-directed ligands as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease, twenty-eight new tacrine-hydroxamate derivatives were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. As expected, most of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities against cholinesterases (ChEs) and histone deacetylase (HDACs). Among the tested compounds, A10 showed not only potent and selective inhibition on AChE at sub-nanomolar potency (AChEIC50 = 0.12 nM, BChEIC50 = 361.52 nM) but also potent inhibition on HDAC (IC50 = 0.23 nM). Moreover, A10 exhibited inhibitory activity on Aβ1-42 self-aggregation as well as disaggregation activity on pre-formed Aβ fibrils. Furthermore, A10 exhibited antioxidant activity and metal chelating properties. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that A10 is a pan-inhibitor of HDACs and a mixed-type inhibitor for AChE. It shown that A10 is a BBB penetrant by online prediction. Taken together, the results indicate that A10 can serve as a lead compound to develop promising candidate analogs as AD therapeutics. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={It is estimated that 50 million people in the world live with dementia, 60-70% of whom suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Different factors are involved in the development of AD, including a reduction in the cholinergic neurotransmission level. The Amaryllidaceae plant family contains an exclusive, large, and still understudied alkaloid group characterized by a singular skeleton arrangement and a broad spectrum of biological activities. The chemistry and biodiversity of Ecuadorian representatives of the Phaedranassa genus (Amaryllidaceae) have not been widely studied. In this work, five Ecuadorian Phaedranassa species were examined in vitro for their activity towards the enzymes acetyl- (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and the alkaloid profile of bulb extracts was analyzed by GC-MS. The species Phaedranassa cuencana and Phaedranassa dubia showed the most AChE and BuChE inhibitory activity, respectively. To obtain insight into the potential role of the identified alkaloids in these inhibitory effects, docking experiments were carried out, and cantabricine showed in silico inhibitory activity against both cholinesterase structures. Our results show that Amaryllidaceae species from Ecuador are a potential source of new drugs for the palliative treatment of AD. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The role of inflammation and dysfunction of the cholinergic system in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has not exhaustively clarified. Thus, in this study, we explore the non-neuronal cholinergic system and the balance of T helper (Th) 17-and T regulatory (Treg)-related cytokines in OSA patients. The study includes 33 subjects with obstructive sleep apnea and 10 healthy controls (HC). The expression levels of cholinergic system component, RAR-related orphan receptor (RORc), transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) and cytokines were evaluated. Th17and Treg-related cytokines, choline levels and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activity were quantified in OSA and control subjects. AChE and nicotinic receptor α 7 subunit (α7nAChR) gene expression and serum levels of choline, AChE and BuChE were lower in OSA patients than in the HC group. Compared with the HC group, OSA patients exhibited an increased expression, secretion and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a reduced expression, secretion and serum levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)β and reduced Foxp3 mRNA levels. The Th17/Treg-related cytokine ratio was higher in the OSA group. Our results confirm and reinforce the hypothesis that OSA may be considered a systemic inflammatory disease, and that an imbalance of non-neuronal cholinergic and pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to development and progression of comorbidities in OSA subjects. The evaluation of Th17/Treg-related cytokine may provide an additional explanation for OSA pathogenesis and clinical features, opening new directions for the OSA management. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Objective(s): As a multifunctional molecule, NO has different effects on liver injury. The present work aimed to investigate the effects of Nos2 knockout (KO) on acute liver injury in aged mice treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Materials and Methods: The acute liver injury model was produced by CCl4at 10 ml/kg body weight in 24-month-old Nos2 KO mice and wild type (WT) mice groups. The histological changes, transaminase and glutathione (GSH) contents, and the expressions of liver function genes superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), as well as apoptosis- and inflammation-associated genes were detected at 0, 6, 16, 20, 28, and 48 hr, respectively. Results: Compared with WT aged mice, there are more fat droplets in liver tissues of Nos2 KO aged mice, and the serum levels of ALT and AST were elevated in the KO group; in addition, there was a decrease in the expression of SOD2 and BCHE and GSH content at multiple time-points. Furthermore, the expression of apoptosis protein CASPASE-3 was elevated from 20 to 48 hr, the same as CASPASE-9 at 28 and 48 hr and pro-apoptotic protein BAX at 6 and 28 hr, while the expression of apoptosis inhibitory protein BCL2 declined at 6 and 28 hr; at the same time the mRNA expressions of genes related to inflammation were increased at different extents in liver extracts of Nos2 KO aged mice. Conclusion: Nos2 KO exacerbated liver injury probably by elevated oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation response in CCl4-induced aged mice liver intoxication model. © 2020 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

abstract={In this study, we attempted for the first time to determine the phytochemical compositions and biopharmaceutical properties of the methanolic and aqueous extracts of Morinda morindoides fruits and seeds. Antioxidant propensities of the extracts were determined via free radical-scavenging, phosphomolybdenum, metal chelating, and reducing power assays. Inhibitory activities against cholinesterases (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)), tyrosinase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase were assessed. Moreover, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined. High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Electrospray Ionization Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) analysis was performed to establish the chemical profile of the investigated extracts. The tested extracts showed remarkable antioxidant abilities with aqueous fruit extract being most potent in all assays, except for ferrous ion chelating assay. Overall, the methanolic extracts were potent inhibitors of the tested enzymes. In conclusion, M. morindoides may be endorsed as promising sources of bioactive compounds and used for designing functional foods. Practical applications: In recent years, new compounds from plant sources have attracted great interest to design functional foods. Thus, we aimed to detect biological and chemical properties of Morinda morindoides fruits and seeds, a widely used as food with medicinal properties in Africa. Based on our findings, fruits extracts exhibited stronger activity when compared to seed extracts. Also, chemical identification was performed for each extracts. The presented findings could provide valuable information into the pool of scientific knowledge and may be basis for the design of novel functional applications from M. morindoides. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Hypericum species have been used since ancient times for medicinal purposes due to their important pharmacological properties. As the most abundant species of the genus Hypericum, Hypericum perforatum is unquestionably one of the best-known and most consumed medicinal plants in the world. The aim of this current study is to evaluate antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antiurease activities of the methanol extracts of flowering aerial parts of Hypericum calycinum L. Hypericum confertum Choisy, and Hypericum perforatum L. from Turkey. In this study, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were determined as pyrocatechol and quercetin equivalents, respectively. Antioxidant activities of the species were carried out by using DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS cation radical scavenging, metal chelate, and CUPRAC activity methods. Among the species that were investigated, it was determined that H. calycinum had the highest total phenolic content (141.12±2.40 μg PEs/mg), whereas H. confertum had the highest total flavonoid content (70.61±0.51 μg QEs/mg). The biochemical results in this study showed that all three species exerted strong antioxidant activity. H. calycinum appeared the most active in all antioxidant activity assays which is mainly due to its rich phenolic content. Additionally, H. calycinum showed the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, while H. perforatum had the best inhibition towards butyrylcholinesterase. According to the urease inhibitory activity assay results, only H. calycinum showed low antiurease activity, whereas the other species did not show any activity against urease. The obtained results suggest that the studied three Hypericum species, especially H. calycinum could be promising sources for the treatment of several diseases because of their antioxidant and anticholinesterase properties. © 2019 SAAB},

abstract={In this work, we have developed a novel series of multi-target-directed ligands to address low levels of acetylcholine (ACh), oxidative stress, metal ion dysregulation, and the misfolded proteins. Novel apigenin-donepezil derivatives, naringenin-donepezil derivatives, genistein-donepezil derivatives and chalcone-donepezil derivatives have been synthesized, in vitro results showed that TM-4 was a reversible and potent huAChE (IC50 = 0.36 μM) and huBChE (IC50 = 15.3 μM) inhibitor, and showed potent antioxidant activity (ORAC = 1.2 eq). TM-4 could significantly inhibit self-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation (IC50 = 3.7 μM). TM-4 was also an ideal neuroprotectant, potential metal chelation agent, and it could inhibit and disaggregate huAChE-induced and Cu2+-induced Aβ aggregation. Moreover, TM-4 could activate UPS degradation pathway in HT22 cells and induce autophagy on U87 cells to clear abnormal proteins associated with AD. More importantly, TM-4 could cross BBB in vitro assay. In addition, in vivo assay revealed that TM-4 exhibited remarkable dyskinesia recovery rate and response efficiency on AlCl3-induced zebrafish AD model, and TM-4 indicated surprising protective effect on Aβ1-40-induced vascular injury. TM-4 presented precognitive effect on scopolamine-induced memory impairment. And the regulation of multi-targets for TM-4 were further conformed through transcriptome sequencing. More interesting, the blood, urine and feces metabolism in rat and rat/human liver microsome metabolism towards TM-4 were also investigated. Overall, TM-4 is a promising multi-function candidate for the development of drugs to Alzheimer's disease. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS},

DNA damage in peripheral whole blood was evaluated by the comet assay and plasma BChE activity was accessed as a measure of exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors. None of the soybean growers reported using full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). BChE was lower in high exposure period than in low exposure period and DNA damage index was significantly increased in the high exposure period than in the low exposure period. In addition, DNA damage in both exposure periods was higher than control group. No correlation was found between exposure time and DNA damage and BChE activity. However, negative correlation was observed between DNA damage in high and low exposure periods.

abstract={Background: A common manifestation of organophosphorus insecticide self-poisoning is prolonged respiratory failure due to neuromuscular junction dysfunction and likely nicotinic receptor overstimulation. We aimed at collecting preliminary data on whether addition of the competitive nicotinic antagonist rocuronium to standard early therapy might be clinically feasible and associated with reduced duration of ventilation. Methods: A pilot three-arm dose–response phase II trial was set up to compare bolus doses of rocuronium bromide titrated to produce initial >95% or 50% inhibition of neuromuscular function, measured using acceleromyography, plus standard treatment, versus standard treatment alone. After attaining inhibition, patients receiving bolus rocuronium then received rocuronium infusions for a maximum of 120 h. Primary outcome was duration of intubation; secondary outcome was case fatality. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity was measured throughout the inpatient stay. Blood was analysed to confirm the organophosphorus insecticide ingested. Results: Forty-five patients were randomised to receive: rocuronium to initially attain 95% inhibition (Roc>95, n = 15), rocuronium to initially attain 50% inhibition (Roc50, n = 14), or no rocuronium (control, n = 16). The most commonly ingested pesticide was profenofos (29/45, 64.4%). Butyrylcholinesterase activity remained severely inhibited for the duration of the study for most patients. Case fatality was 9/45 (20%) and similar across study arms: control 3/16 (18.8%), Roc50 4/14 (28.6%) and Roc>95 2/15 (13.3%) (p =.5842). When excluding patients who died, median [IQR] duration of intubation was significantly longer in the Roc50 (259.5 [176–385] h) and Roc>95 (226.8 [186–355] h) groups compared to controls (88.5 [47–160] h, p =.0162 and p =.0016, respectively). Conclusions: In this pilot dose–response study, we found no evidence that rocuronium in addition to standard therapy reduced the duration of intubation. It is possible that it worsened neuromuscular junction function. Further clinical research, including testing of shorter duration regimens, needs to be performed before nicotinic antagonists can be used in the clinical management of OP poisoning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Satisfyingly, compound 5 was identified as a highly selective low micromolar inhibitor of BChE (BChE IC50 = 1.4 μM). The binding mode prediction and kinetic analysis were performed to obtain detailed information about compound 5. Besides, a preliminary structure–activity relationship investigation of compound 5 was carried out for further development of the series.

All the investigated compounds showed a strong inhibitory potency toward both enzymes with IC50 values in micromolar range of concentration; compound 1 displayed the most potent inhibitory behaviour toward both enzymes. The mechanism of the AChE and BuChE inhibition was examined by enzyme kinetic measurements. The obtained kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km indicated an uncompetitive type of inhibition of both enzymes by compound 1. For the other two compounds a non-competitive inhibition mode was observed. To get further insight into the mechanism of action and to elucidate binding modes in details we examined the interactions of 1–3 with acetylcholinesterase, using molecular docking approach. Grid based docking studies indicated that these compounds can bind to peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the AChE with Ki values in micromolar range. Moreover, blind docking revealed the capability of investigated compounds to bind to new allosteric site (i.e. binding site II) distinct from PAS. Showing that these Cu-based compounds can act as new allosteric inhibitors of AChE and identifying novel allosteric binding site on AChE represents a significant contribution toward the design of novel and more effective inhibitors of AChE. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

In recent past, we have reported various classes of compounds as enzyme inhibitors, in continuation; A series of 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole hydrazone derivatives (9-42) were synthesized through multistep reactions in high yields and evaluated for butyrylcholinesterase inhibition. In present study, 2-ethylthio benzimidazole was formed by the reaction of 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole with bromoethane. In the second step (2-(2-(ethylthio)benzimidazolyl)acetate) obtained by the reaction of 2-ethylthio benzimidazole with ethyl chloroacetate.

Biological tests demonstrated that most of the synthesized compounds have moderate to good inhibitory activities effect on cholinesterase enzymes. Among them, 10e showed the best profile as a selected compound for inhibition of hAChE (IC50 = 0.32) and hBuChE (IC50 = 0.43 μM) enzymes. Kinetic analysis and molecular docking led to a better understanding of this compound. Kinetic studies disclosed that 10e inhibited acetylcholinesterase in mixed-type and butyrylcholinesterase in non-competitive type. The toxicity results showed that 10e is less toxic than donepezil and has better inhibitory activity against hBuChE when compared to donepezil or Galantamine. Other performed experiments revealed that 10e has an anti-β amyloid effect which is capable of reducing ROS, LDH and MDA also possing positive effect on TAC.

abstract={The accumulation and persistence of chemical pesticides in aquatic ecosystems represent serious threats to both fish and humans. Useful tools for ecotoxicological studies of marine ecosystems are based on biomarker application to key fish species. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of pesticides in a coastal marine environment, as the tourist port of Bagnara Calabra on the western Calabrian coast of Italy. This was based on acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymatic activities as biomarkers in the key fish species Parablennius sanguinolentus. The reference site of Jancuia Cove was also investigated. There was significant inhibition of these acetylcholinesterase (23.5%) and butyrylcholinesterase (72.0%) activities for Bagnara Calabra Port compared to Jancuia Cove. The esterase inhibition was primarily due to carbamate and organophosphorus insecticides, which showed higher concentrations for Bagnara Calabra Port (means, 1.0 μg L−1, 0.14 μg L−1, respectively) with respect to the reference quality standard set by Italian Law. These data indicate the presence of insecticides in the waters of Bagnara Calabra Port that might represent considerable hazard to humans, as the surrounding areas include bathing and recreational fishing activities throughout the year. This study also confirms the benefits that can be gained from such a biomarker-based approach when applied to a fish species for the monitoring of water ecosystems, to define the ecotoxicological, and the consequent ecological, alterations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the current study, in vitro neuroprotective effect of carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) pulp (wild and cultivated varieties) at the unripe and ripe stage was investigated through testing against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As neurodegenerative disorders are strongly related to oxidative damage and metal accumulation, the antioxidant activity of carob extracts was determined by DPPH, ABTS, ferric reducing power (FRP), CUPRAC and ferrous iron chelating (FIC) assays at both ripening stages. Total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoids (TFC) and total condensed tannin contents (CTC) were also assessed. At the unripe stage, the samples of both varieties exhibited an interesting inhibitory effect against AChE and BChE with a strong antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals and by acting as reducing agents. The result showed that the concentrations of TPC, TFC, and CTC were decreased significantly (P < 0.05) during ripening. The same observations were found for antioxidant activities. The results suggested that the extract of unripe carob may provide a substantial source of secondary metabolites, which act as natural antioxidants and as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that may be beneficial in the treatment of AD. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the elderly. There is no ideal treatment for AD. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify anti-AD peptides from ovalbumin. RESULTS: The potential tripeptides IEK, LYR, and CIK were selected for molecular docking. The ‘-CDOCKER_Energy’ values of the best docking positions of the tripeptide IEK, LYR, and CIK interacting with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were 93.8119, 86.9556 and 73.6370 kcal mol−1, respectively. The ‘-CDOCKER_Energy’ values for interaction with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were 96.6386, 80.8392, and 87.4341 kcal mol−1, respectively. Most importantly, the ‘-CDOCKER_Energy’ values for interaction with β-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme1 (BACE1) were 85.5903, 71.3342, and 68.4290 kcal mol−1, respectively. Overall, in vitro assay results demonstrated that the peptide CIK exhibited impressive inhibitory activities against AChE, BChE, and BACE1, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 6.76, 7.72, and 34.48 μmol L−1, respectively. In particular, CIK can be joined with some peripheral anion sites (PAS) and catalytic sites on AChE, BChE, and BACE1. CONCLUSION: Tripeptide CIK can effectively inhibit the activities of AChE, BChE, and BACE1. Tripeptide CIK therefore has the potential to treat AD effectively. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Introduction: Pesticides are widely used around the world, and rural workers have greater risk of poisoning. The use of biomarkers for insecticides can contribute to the diagnosis and prevention of poisoning. Objective: To identify, in the scientific literature, the biomarkers of occupational exposure to insecticides of different insecticide classes. Methods: The PubMed, Lilacs and Embase databases were analyzed using a systematic search strategy and in accordance with the criteria established by the PRISMA methodology. Articles with information related to the use of biomarkers to identify active ingredients, or insecticide metabolites, or effects on the human biological matrices were analyzed. Results: A total of 840 studies was found, and 30 met the selection criteria. The search identified 118 results for insecticide biomarkers, of which 45% were of exposure, 42% of effect, and 14% of susceptibility. Additionally, 78 were possible biomarkers, and only 67 confirmed to be different biomarkers for insecticides. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP-y), specific for Chlorpyrifos, were among the most common biomarkers identified; however, most metabolites found were non-specific. Conclusion: Various insecticide biomarkers were mentioned; nonetheless, only a few are specific and used to identify the wide range of insecticides to which farm workers are exposed. © 2019},

abstract={The aim of the present work is to characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil and to determinate the antioxidant, anticholinesterase and α-glucosidase activities of Rosmarinus tournefortii de Noé. The essential oil of fresh aerial part of Rosmarinus tournefortii de Noé was analyzed by GC–MS and revealed the presence of 1,8-Cineole (55.26%), l-Borneol (9.57%) and β-Pinène (9.41%) and were identified as major compounds. The antioxidant activity was assessed using different methods, the anticholinesterase activity was determined by AChE and BChE and the α-glucosidase activity was evaluated using 4-Nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside as substrate. The antioxidant activity showed the good antioxidant activity of the butanolic and chloroform extracts in DPPH, ABTS·+, O2 − DMSO alkalin, Reducing power, β-Carotene-linoleic acid and CUPRAC assays. Furthermore the anticholinesterase activity against acetylcholinesterase of the essential oil exhibited the highest activity, very close to the standard galantamine and for butyrylcholinesterase the chloroform extract exhibited activity higher than the standard galantamine. Moreover the α-glucosidase inhibitory of the chloroform extract showed a higher activity more than the standard acarbose. These results suggest a possible use of Rosmarinus tournefortii de Noé as a potential source of bioactive molecules with anticholinesterase antioxidant and antidiabetic properties. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With the surge in the cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the years, several targets have been explored to curb the disease. Cholinesterases, namely acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), remain to be the available targets that are amendable to currently approved treatments. In this study, a series of novel compounds based on tramiprosate, a highly specific amyloid beta (Aβ) inhibitor, was designed to inhibit AChE, BuChE, and Aβ aggregation. In particular, the addition of a pyridinium/isoquinolinium ring to the tramiprosate moiety (to give compounds 3a–j) led to an increase in the binding affinity for the catalytic active site of cholinesterase, which was hampered by the presence of sulfonic acid. Exclusion of the sulfonic acid moiety led to a novel but effective class of cholinesterase inhibitors (9a–w). in vitro Aβ aggregation inhibition assay indicated that compounds 3a–j, 9e–f, 9i–l, 9q, 9r, 9u–w, and 12 could inhibit over 10% Aβ aggregation at 1 mM concentration. Cholinesterase inhibition assay suggested that compounds 9g, 9h, 9o, and 9q–t exhibit over 70% inhibition on both AChE and BuChE at a concentration of 100 μM. Amongst the designed molecules, compound 9r (ca 18% at 1 mM) showed comparable inhibitory effect on the inhibition of Aβ aggregation with tramiprosate (ca 20% at 1 mM), along with impressive cholinesterase inhibitory potential (AChE IC50 = 13 μM and BuChE IC50 = 12 μM), acceptable toxicity and ability to pass through blood brain barrier, which could be used to ameliorate the phenotypes of AD in preclinical models. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In the present study we investigated seasonal and intrinsic variability of neurotoxic and cyto-genotoxic biomarkers in blood plasma and erythrocytes of free-living Eleonoras’ falcons, captured during the pre-breeding (May of 2017 and 2018) and breeding period (September of 2017) on the Antikythira Island (Greece). Specifically, blood samples of captured birds were prepared for the determination of cholinesterase (ChEs, i.e. acetylcholinesterase/AChE and butyrylcholinesterase/ BChE) activity, as well as the formation of nuclear (i.e. the formation of micronuclei into the cells/MN, binucleated cells/BN and others), and cellular/cytoplasmic (i.e. echinocytes/EC, acanthocytes/AC and notched cells/NC) abnormalities in blood plasma and erythrocytes, respectively. Our results indicated that birds sampled in late May had higher ChE and BChE activity levels, as well as higher frequency of total nuclear abnormalities. The latter were also higher in second calendar year (2cy) birds. Cellular/cytoplasmic abnormalities were less frequent in falcons having better body condition, sampled in late May, as well as in light-morph falcons. The observed ChEs activities, as well as nuclear and cellular/cytoplasmic abnormalities revealed that Eleonora's falcons are likely to be exposed to chemical agents with neurotoxic and cyto-genotoxic potential year round, while different aspects of their biology and ecology, such as their reproductive and nutritional status, could mediate their levels. Although we encourage more sampling campaigns to verify the identified seasonal and intrinsic sources of variation in biomarkers tested, the current study enriches the existing knowledge about their usefulness in the environmental monitoring and risk assessment of migratory birds, like Eleonoras’ falcon. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The stem bark (SB) of Piptadeniastrum africanum (PA) has been extensively used in African traditional medicinal systems. However, there is a dearth of scientific information regarding its possible activity in the management of type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and skin hyperpigmentation disorders. This study therefore attempted to elucidate the in vitro inhibitory action of ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts of P. africanum stem bark (PA-SB) on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase. Cell viability, catecholamine, and 3-hydroxykynurenine levels of hypothalamic HypoE22 cells exposed to PA-SB extracts were also investigated. The phytochemical profiles of the extracts were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and antioxidant properties were investigated. Saponin (867.42 mg quillaja equivalent/g) and tannin (33.81 mg catechin equivalent/g) contents were higher in the methanol extract. Multiple dihydroxy-trimethoxy(iso)flavone isomers, loliolide, eriodictyol, naringenin, luteolin, chrysoeriol, apigenin, and liquiritigenin, were characterized from PA-SB extracts using HPLC. The methanol extract of PA-SB showed highest inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (4.88 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g extract), butyrylcholinesterase (5.37 mg GALAE/g extract), and tyrosinase (154.86 mg kojic acid equivalent/g extract) while α-glucosidase was effectively inhibited by the ethyl acetate extract (15.22 mmol acarbose equivalent/g extract). The methanol extract of PA-SB also showed potent antioxidant properties (493.87, 818.12, 953.07, and 732.19 mg Trolox equivalent/g extract, for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, respectively). PA-SB extracts exhibited antioxidant activity and promising inhibition against key enzymes related to type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and skin hyperpigmentation disorders. Additionally, all extracts were able to contrast hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, in HypoE22 cells, thus restoring basal catecholamine and 3-hydroxykinurenine levels, whereas only methanol and water extracts stimulated basal dopamine release. Overall, data from the present study contribute to the biological assessment of P. africanum that appears to be a promising source of natural compounds with protective and neuromodulatory effects. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Background/Objective: Ginsenosides, the major active components of the ginseng, are known to have various effects on nervous systems. The present study aimed to clarify the inhibition potentials of ginsenosides Rb1, Rc, Re and Rg1 on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities, and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of inhibitions provided by protein-ligand interactions considering their probable candidates of prodrug. Materials and methods: The inhibitory mechanisms of ginsenosides related with their structural diversity were analyzed kinetically and protein-ligand interactions for both enzymes were evaluated with most potent ginsenosides, by molecular docking studies. Results: Ginsenosides Re and Rg1, with sugar moieties attached to the C-6 and C-20 positions of core structure were found to possess the most powerful inhibitory effect on AChE and BChE activities. Molecular docking studies have been confirmed by kinetic studies. Ginsenosides having a direct interaction with amino acid residues belonging to the catalytic triad revealed the most powerful inhibition with lowest enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant (Ki) values. Conclusions: Ginsenosides Re and Rg1, either alone or in a specific combination, may provide beneficial effects on neurodegenerative pathologies in therapeutic terms. © 2020 De Gruyter.

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterised by the apoptosis of cholinergic neurons and the consequent attenuation of acetylcholine mediated neurotransmission, resulting in neurodegeneration. Acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE) are attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of AD since inhibition of these enzymes can be used to restore synaptic concentrations of acetylcholine. Whilst inhibitors for these enzymes such as galantamine and rivastigmine have been approved for use, none are able to halt the progression of AD and are responsible for the production of troublesome side-effects. Efficacious cholinesterase inhibitors have been isolated from natural plant-based compounds with many demonstrating additional benefits beyond cholinesterase inhibition, such as antioxidation and anti-inflammation, which are key parts of AD pathology. In this study, five natural flavan-3-ol (catechin) compounds: ((-)-epicatechin (EC), catechin, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG),) (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), isolated from green tea, were screened for their cholinesterase inhibitory activity using the Ellman assay. The kinetics of inhibition was determined using reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. EGCG was the only compound found to produce statistically significant, competitive inhibition, of both AChE (p < 0.01) and BuChE (p < 0.01) with IC50 values of 0.0148 µmol/mL and 0.0251 µmol/mL respectively. These results, combined with previously identified antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, highlight the potential use of EGCG in the treatment of AD, provided it can be delivered to cholinergic neurons in therapeutic concentrations. Further testing of EGCG in vivo is recommended to fully characterise the pharmacokinetic properties, optimal method of administration and efficacy of this novel plant-based compound. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Endometritis is an inflammation of the endometrium associated with bacterial infection. The pathogenesis of endometritis in cows is still not completely understood. The combined analysis of the markers of inflammation and oxidative stress has contributed to a better understanding of disease mechanisms, but is still unexplored in uterine disorders. Moreover, research provides evidence about an important role of the vagus nerve in regulating the innate immune function through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in response to bacterial infections. This new pathway has demonstrated a critical role in controlling the inflammatory system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of cholinesterase in total blood, lymphocytes, and serum of dairy cows with clinical and subclinical endometritis. Sixty-one Holstein cows, between 30 and 45 days in milk, were classified into 3 groups of animals: presenting clinical endometritis (n = 22), subclinical endometritis (n = 17), and healthy (n = 22). Mean leukocyte counts did not differ among groups, but the neutrophil number was significantly higher in cows with clinical endometritis than those in healthy animals. Also, serum concentration of interleukin-1beta (pg/mL) was significantly higher in cows with endometritis. The activity of acetylcholinesterase in blood and lymphocytes increased in both groups with endometritis. Animals with endometritis presented an increase in lipid peroxidation, but the antioxidant enzyme activity (catalase levels) was higher in endometritis groups than in normal cows. In conclusion, the inflammatory process of clinical and subclinical endometritis leads to systemic lipid peroxidation despite the compensatory increase of the antioxidant enzyme. These data also provide evidence of an important role of the cholinergic pathway in regulating dairy cows with clinical and subclinical endometritis. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive impairment of cognitive ability. Patients with AD display neuropathological lesions including senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. There are no disease-modifying drugs currently available. With the number of affected individuals increasing dramatically throughout the world, there is obvious urgent need for effective treatment strategy for AD. The multifactorial nature of AD encouraged the development of multifunctional compounds, able to interact with several putative targets. Here, we have evaluated the effects of two in-house designed cannabinoid receptors (CB) agonists showing inhibitory actions on β-secretase-1 (BACE-1) (NP137) and BACE-1/butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) (NP148), on cellular models of AD, including immortalized lymphocytes from late-onset AD patients. Furthermore, the performance of TgAPP mice in a spatial navigation task was investigated following chronic administration of NP137 and NP148. We report here that NP137 and NP148 showed neuroprotective effects in amyloid-β-treated primary cortical neurons, and NP137 in particular rescued the cognitive deficit of TgAPP mice. The latter compound was able to blunt the abnormal cell response to serum addition or withdrawal of lymphoblasts derived from AD patients. It is suggested that NP137 could be a good drug candidate for future treatment of AD. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Vogel, O. sipyleum L. and O. hypericifolium O.Schwarz & P.H.Davis belonging to sect. Anatolicon Ietsw. were analyzed for their chemical composition of essential oil and phenolic components. The essential oil compositions were analysed by using GC-MS and GC-FID. The phenolic contents of the chloroform, acetone, and methanol extracts were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Antioxidant activities of the extracts were investigated by using three methods; DPPH free radical scavenging activity, β-carotene linoleic acid assays and CUPRAC assays. The essential oil compositions of the section Amaracus were found to be as carvacrol type (O. ayliniae, O. boissieri) and p-cymene type (O. saccatum, O. solymicum). In the section of Anatolicon, while O. sipyleum was found as γ-terpinene type, O. hypericifolium was carvacrol type. In the extracts, the most abundant components were determined as flavonoids, coumaric acids and derivatives. Especially rosmarinic acid and penduletin were detected in high amounts. Among the studied species, extracts of O. ayliniae showed quite good activity for all methods. The extracts from all species showed remarkable antioxidant activity. Inhibition capability of the extracts against acetyl and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes (AChE and BChE) were determined. The extracts were found as inactive against AChE. The moderate inhibition capacity observed against BChE. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={We endeavoured to probe into and compare the possible effect(s) of different extraction techniques (accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasonication-assisted extraction (UAE), maceration, and Soxhlet extraction (SE)) on the bioactivity (antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities) of the aerial parts of Helichrysum stoechas subsp. barrelieri (Ten.) Nyman. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts obtained by different extraction methods followed the order of ASE > MAE > UAE > maceration > SE. Extract obtained by ASE was the most potent radical scavenger (219.92 and 313.12 mg Trolox equivalent [TE]/g, against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), respectively) and reducing agent (927.39 and 662.87 mg TE/g, for cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), respectively). Helichrysum stoechas extract obtained by UAE (18.67 mg ethylenediaminetetraacetic equivalent [EDTAE]/g) was the most active metal chelator and inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (4.23 mg galantamine equivalent [GALAE]/g) and butyrylcholinesterase (6.05 mg GALAE/g) cholinesterase. Extract from maceration (183.32 mg kojic acid equivalent [KAE]/g) was most active against tyrosinase while ASE extract (1.66 mmol acarbose equivalent [ACAE]/g) effectively inhibited α-glucosidase. In conclusion, data amassed herein tend to advocate for the use of non-conventional extraction techniques, namely ASE and UAE, for the extraction of bioactive secondary metabolites from H. stoechas aerial parts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The neuroprotective activities of phenolics have been demonstrated in several studies, with their antioxidant properties playing an influential role. In this study, the therapeutic effect of ferulic acid was investigated on oxidative stress, purinergic and cholinergic enzymatic activities, and dysregulated metabolic pathways in oxidative brain injury. Ferulic acid significantly elevated the reduced glutathione (GSH) level, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and concomitantly depleted malondialdehyde and nitric oxide level. It also inhibited the activities of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, and increased the activities of ATPase. LC-MS analysis of the metabolites revealed restoration of most depleted metabolites, with concomitant generation of dihydroferulic acid 4-O-glucuronide, diadenosine heptaphosphate, cis-4-decenoic acid, ganglioside GT3 (d18:0/23:0), phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, and phosphoribosyl-ATP on treatment with ferulic acid. Pathway analysis of the identified metabolites revealed reactivation of oxidative-inactivated pathways, with concomitant activation of histidine and inositol phosphate metabolic pathways. There was no cytotoxicity on incubation of ferulic acid with HT22 cells. Molecular docking studies revealed a high affinity for acetylcholinesterase, with a binding energy of − 7.4 kcal/mol. In silico simulation analysis predicted permeability of ferulic acid across blood brain barrier (BBB) and an oral LD50 calculated value of 1772 mg/kg, with a toxicity class of 4. These results indicate the antioxidative and protective effects of ferulic acid in oxidative brain injury. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recent uses of nerve agents underline the need of early diagnosis as trigger to react (initiating medical countermeasures, avoiding cross-contamination). As organophosphorus (OP) pesticide poisoning exerts the same pathomechanism, that is, inhibition of the pivotal enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a portable cholinesterase (ChE) test kit was applied in an emergency room for rapid diagnosis of OP poisoning. OP nerve agents or pesticides result in the inhibition of AChE. As AChE is also expressed on erythrocytes, patient samples are easily available. However, in most clinics only determination of plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is established which lacks a pathophysiological correlate, shows higher variability in the population and behaves different regarding inhibition by OP and reactivation by oximes. The ChE test kit helped to diagnose atypical cases of OP poisoning, for example, missing of typical muscarinic symptoms, and resulted in administration of pralidoxime, the oxime used in Serbia. The ChE test kit also allows an initial assessment whether an oxime therapy is successful. In one case report, AChE activity increased after oxime administration indicating therapeutic success whereas BChE activity did not. With only BChE at hand, this therapeutic effect would have been missed. As inhibition of AChE or BChE activity is determined, the CE-certified device is a global diagnostic tool for all ChE inhibitors including carbamates which might also be misused as chemical weapon. The ChE test kit is a helpful point-of-care device for the diagnosis of ChE inhibitor poisoning. Its small size and easy menu-driven use advocate procurement where nerve agent and OP pesticide exposure are possible. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

abstract={In our study, Allium nigrum L. and Allium subhirsutum L. were investigated in terms of phenolic profile, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and tyrosinase inhibitory potentials. The colorimetric analysis revealed that the highest levels of total phenol (45.6, 15.8 mg GAE/g extract, respectively) and total flavonoid contents (8.2, 5.7 mg QE/g extract, respectively) were found in the bulbs of both plants. About 30 compounds were determined by LC-ESI-MS/MS with validated method and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (2,188.4 μg/g extract) and p-coumaric acid (1,700.8 μg/g extract) were major phenolic acids. (−)-Epigallocatechin gallate (998.3 µg/g extract) and genistein (159.3 μg/g extract) which are neuroprotective compounds were the predominant flavonoids for A. nigrum and A. subhirsutum, respectively. Enzyme inhibitory activities of samples were performed by spectrophotometrically with 96-well microplate reader. All samples showed anti-AChE, anti-BuChE, and anti-tyrosinase activities and the aerial part of A. nigrum was the most potent (IC50 6.1, 3.27, 22.31 µg/ml, respectively). Practical applications: Many Allium species, especially those cultivated, are consumed in different countries as food in different ways. In the literature, studies on these species have generally focused on organosulfur compounds of the species. In our present study, phenolic compounds having a wide range of biological activities were determined in different parts of the two Allium species consumed as food. We also investigated in vitro cholinesterases and tyrosinase inhibition activities of these species. A correlation was observed between phenolic compounds and enzyme inhibition activities. These results were further explored and confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA revealed that samples were discriminated from each other according to phenolic compounds and enzyme inhibitory potencies. Conclusively, this study determines that the chemical profiles and biological activities of A. nigrum and A. subhirsutum. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a common outcome caused by organophosphorus (OPs) intoxication. Although inconsistent, the standard treatment consists of a muscarinic receptor antagonist (atropine) and AChE-reactivating molecules such as oximes. This study proposes to test unpublished compounds which contain the moieties of isatin and/or oxime have protective effects against the toxicity induced by malathion in two animal models: Artemia salina and Rattus norvegicus (Wistar rats). The lethality was assessed in A salina, and the calculated LD50 to (3Z)-5-chloro-3-(hydroxyimino) indolin-2-one oxime (Cℓ-HIN) and 2-(5-chloro-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-hydrazinecarbothioamide (Cℓ-OXHS) was higher than 1000 µM while to 3-(phenylhydrazono) butan-2-one oxime (PHBO) was 38 µM. Our screening showed that Cℓ-HIN seems to be the most promising molecule, with low toxicity to A salina, protection against mortality (with or without atropine) and AChE inhibition induced by malathion. Similarly, the oral administration of 300 mg/kg of Cℓ-HIN induced low or no toxicity in rats. The plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and cortical AChE activities were reactivated by Cℓ-HIN (50 mg/kg, p.o.) in rats exposed to malathion (250 mg/kg, i.p). No difference was observed in paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity among groups treated. In conclusion, Cℓ-HIN restored the cholinesterase activities inhibited by malathion in A salina and rats with low toxicity in both. Thus, the data provide evidence that Cℓ-HIN, a compound that combines isatin and oxime functional groups, is safe and has important properties to reactivate the cholinesterases inhibited by malathion. In addition, we demonstrate the importance of a preliminary assessment in an alternative model in order to reduce the use of mammalians in drug discovery. © 2019 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)},

abstract={Tanacetum parthenium (L.) Sch.Bip (TP), a flowering plant, is famous in traditional medicine to prevent migraine and headache. However, there is currently a dearth of studies to advocate the phytochemical profile and biological propensities of extracts prepared from this plant. This study endeavors to highlight the biological potential of TP extracts prepared by modern (ultrasound-UAE, microwave-MAE and accelerated-ASE extractions) and traditional (maceration and Soxhlet) extraction techniques. The chemical profile of the extracts was established via ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) technique. Sixty different polyphenolic compounds belonging to the classes of phenolic acids, flavonoid glycosides and flavonoid aglycones were recorded in the extracts. Additionally, the quantity of 17 components was measured using appropriate standards and it was found that the modern extraction gave extracts with the higher content of observed compounds than the traditional techniques. Evaluation of antioxidant activity was determined in vitro via five standard assays. The inhibitory potential of TP extracts against key enzymes implicated in the non-communicable diseases such as diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), neurodegenerative diseases (acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase) and skin diseases (tyrosinase), was assessed. Potent antioxidant ability of all TP extract was revealed with a predominance for the extracts yielded using the ASE method. This potent antioxidant activity of the extracts corroborated with the high phenolic (65.05 ± 0.27 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract) and flavonoid contents (55.40 ± 0.52 mg rutin equivalent (RE)/g extract). Tanacetum parthenium extracts also showed significant α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (1.63–1.67 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g extract) and moderate inhibition activity against α-amylase (0.51-0.56 mmol ACAE/g extract). The extracts also showed potent activity against cholinesterases and tyrosinase. This study tend to validate the use of TP extracts obtained by novel extraction techniques such as ASE, as potent bioactive extracts to be further studied for therapeutic bio-product development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Hip fracture is both a cause and a consequence of sarcopenia. Older persons with sarcopenia have an increased risk of falling, and the prevalence of sarcopenia may be increased in those who suffer a hip fracture. The aim of this study was to explore potential biomarkers (neuromuscular and peripheral pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers) that may be associated with sarcopenia in very old persons with hip fracture. Methods: We recruited 150 consecutive patients ≥80 years old admitted to an orthogeriatric unit for an osteoporotic hip fracture. Muscle mass was assessed pre-operatively using bioelectrical impedance analysis; Janssen's (J) and Masanés' (M) reference cut-off points were used to define low muscle mass. Muscle strength was assessed with handgrip strength (Jamar's dynamometer). Sarcopenia was defined by having both low muscle mass and strength and using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 definition of probable sarcopenia (low grip strength). Peripheral markers—pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters—were determined either in the plasma or in the erythrocyte fraction obtained from peripheral whole blood of every patient pre-operatively. Results: Mean age was 87.6 ± 4.9 years, and 78.7% were women. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 11.5% with Janssen's, 34.9% with Masanés' cut-offs, and 93.3% with the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 definition of probable sarcopenia. Among the four pro-inflammatory cytokines tested in plasma, only tumour necrosis factor-α was different (lower) in sarcopenic than in non-sarcopenic participants using both muscle mass cut-offs (J 7.9 ± 6.2 vs. 8.3 ± 5.8, M 6.8 ± 4.7 vs. 9.1 ± 6.2). Erythrocyte glutathione system showed a non-significant tendency to lower glutathione levels and glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratios in sarcopenic participants compared with non-sarcopenic subjects. Catalase activity was also lower in sarcopenic participants (J 2904 ± 1429 vs. 3329 ± 1483, M 3037 ± 1430 vs. 3431 ± 1498). No significant differences were found between groups in chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and butyrylcholinesterase activity, C-terminal agrin fragment, interferon-γ, or interleukin-1β. Conclusions: The prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with hip fracture varies according to the definition and the muscle mass reference cut-off points used. We did not find differences in most neuromuscular, pro-inflammatory, or oxidative stress markers, except for lower peripheral tumour necrosis factor-α levels and catalase activity in sarcopenic participants, which may be markers of an early inflammatory reaction that is hampered in sarcopenic patients. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease related to ageing. Cholinesterases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), which is an essential process in the cholinergic neurotransmission. Cholinesterases can be divided into two types, namely acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). This paper reports virtual screening and molecular docking of 200 compounds obtained from the ZINC database, using AutoDock Vina and AutoDock 4.2 to find potential AChE inhibitors. Only compounds that are compliant with Lipinski's rule of five for drug-likeness properties were virtually screened to identify novel compounds that show similar or better interaction with the target protein compared to the coordinated ligand galantamine. The results showed that 6 compounds, namely ZINC10140364, ZINC08061148, ZINC34735322, ZINC05151975, ZINC33126088 and ZINC15805418, exhibited better free energy of binding (FEB) than galantamine, with AutoDock Vina scores of −9.88, −10.44, −10.30, −9.63, −8.35 and −9.42 kcal/mol and AutoDock scores of −12.3, −11.6, −11.0, −10.9, −10.5 and −9.3 kcal/mol, respectively. In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that the 6 compounds are potential AChE inhibitors suitable for further evaluation and development as potential agents for treatment. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={BACKGROUND: In this investigation, the chemical and biological profiles of three Turkish Crataegus species (Crataegus orientalis, Crataegus szovitsii and Crataegus tanacetifolia) were studied in order to provide the first comprehensive characterization and their health-promoting potential. In this respect, polyphenolic profiles were evaluated using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The in vitro antioxidant activities of the Crataegus samples were evaluated by using free-radical scavenging, phosphomolybdenum, ferrous-ion chelating, and reducing power assays. The inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase, amylase, cholinesterases (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)), and tyrosinase were also established. RESULTS: The untargeted metabolomic approach highlighted the effect of both extraction types and species on the phenolic profiles of different Crateagus tissues (i.e. leaves and twigs). The methanolic extracts showed the maximum radical scavenging and reducing activity in all test systems, whereas for ferrous-ion chelating assays the decocted and infused extracts showed the highest activity. Only the methanolic extracts were effective against AChE and BChE. The extract tested showed remarkable inhibitory effects against tyrosinase and α-glucosidase, whereas all the extracts exhibited modest inhibition against α-amylase. Overall, the twig extracts of the three species studied showed superior antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these results, the three Crataegus species can be classified as potent bioresources for high-value phytochemicals, which warrant further investigations for developing novel nutraceuticals. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Introduction: The article presents the results of studying the protective properties of recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (rhBChE) in a model of acute anticholinesterase poisoning in mice knocked out for the BChE gene. Balb/c inbred mice were also used to demonstrate the important role of BChE. Materials and methods: In the study, BChE-ko and Balb/c mice were used. An organophosphorus compound (OPC) paraoxon was used as a toxic agent causing acute anticholinesterase poisoning. rhBChE was used as an antidote for OPC poisoning. To obtain rhBChE, an expression system based on CHO cell lines was chosen. In order to suppress BChE in Balb/c mice, a carboxyl esterase blocker cresylbenzodioxaphosphorin oxide (CBDP) was used. Two parameters were used to study the recovery after toxicity modeling: the end time of the animal tremor and the distance covered in open-field for 3 minutes. Results and discussion: The acute poisoning model using the CBDP blocker showed that the sensitivity of Balb/c mice increased significantly. The use of rhBChE against the background of CBDP allowed achieving 100% survival of animals with the minimum lethal dose of paraoxon. Knockout mice are expected to be more sensitive to the toxin, and the use of a biological trap in the form of rhBChE made it possible for 70% of the animals to survive with the minimum lethal dose of paraoxon. Besides, the use of rhBChE facilitated reducing the recovery time after OPC poisoning. Conclusion: The results of the study showed that the use of rhBChE as a protective agent in acute OPC poisoning significantly increased the survival of the animals and reduced the clinical manifestations of poisoning.

abstract={A series of new 4-arylthiazole-2-amine derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were designed and synthesized, Furthermore, their inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase in vitro were tested by Ellman spectrophotometry, and the results of inhibitory activity test showed that most of them had a certain acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity in vitro. Moreover, the IC50 value of compound 4f was to 0.66 μM, which was higher than that of Rivastigmine and Huperzine-A as reference compounds, and it had a weak inhibitory effect on butyrylcholinesterase. The potential binding mode of compound 4f with AChE was investigated by the molecular docking, and the results showed that 4f was strongly bound up with AChE with the optimal conformation, in addition, their binding energy reached −11.27 Kcal*mol−1. At last, in silico molecular property of the synthesized compounds were predicted by using Molinspiration online servers. It can be concluded that the lead AChEIs compound 4f presented satisfactory drug-like characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study, we reported the synthesis, characterization and activity-structure relationship of novel β-amino carbonyl compounds. Some novel bis-β-amino carbonyl (4a-e) and mono-β-amino carbonyl (5a-e) compounds were synthesized by using CeCl3·7H2O catalyzed Mannich-type reaction. The title compounds were characterized by FTIR, elemental analysis, 13C NMR and 1H NMR techniques. In addition, the crystal and molecular structures of 5a, 5d and 5e were illuminated by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The activity-structure relationship was established by analyzing the enzyme activity of synthesized β-amino carbonyl compounds, which were effectively inhibited by human carbonic anhydrase I (hCA I), and II (hCA II) isoenzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). According to the activity-structure relationship, the Ki values of the β-amino carbonyl compounds were determined between 11.42 and 70.71 nM on hCA I, 28.66–77.59 nM on hCA II, 18.66–95.35 nM on AChE and 9.54–94.70 nM on BChE. We hope that these compounds may have promising new potentials in both CA isoenzymes AChE and BChE enzyme inhibitors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a pivotal enzyme in neurotransmission. Its inhibition leads to cholinergic crises and could ultimately result in death. A related enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), may act in the CNS as a co-regulator in terminating nerve impulses and is a natural plasma scavenger upon exposure to organophosphate (OP) nerve agents that irreversibly inhibit both enzymes. With the aim of improving reactivation of cholinesterases phosphylated by nerve agents sarin, VX, cyclosarin, and tabun, ten phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline (PIQ) aldoximes were synthesized by Huisgen 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition between alkyne- and azide-building blocks. The PIQ moiety may serve as a peripheral site anchor positioning the aldoxime moiety at the AChE active site. In terms of evaluated dissociation inhibition constants, the aldoximes could be characterized as high-affinity ligands. Nevertheless, high binding affinity of these oximes to AChE or its phosphylated conjugates did not assure rapid and selective AChE reactivation. Rather, potential reactivators of phosphylated BChE, with its enlarged acyl pocket, were identified, especially in case of cyclosarin, where the reactivation rates of the lead reactivator was 100- and 6-times that of 2-PAM and HI-6, respectively. Nevertheless, the return of the enzyme activity was affected by the nerve agent conjugated to catalytic serine, which highlights the lack of the universality of reactivators with respect to both the target enzyme and OP structure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A majority of cocaine users also consume alcohol. The concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol produces the pharmacologically active metabolites cocaethylene and norcocaethylene, in addition to norcocaine. Both cocaethylene and norcocaethylene are more toxic than cocaine itself. Hence, a truly valuable cocaine-metabolizing enzyme for cocaine abuse/overdose treatment should be effective for the hydrolysis of not only cocaine, but also its metabolites norcocaine, cocaethylene, and norcocaethylene. However, there has been no report on enzymes capable of hydrolyzing norcocaethylene (the most toxic metabolite of cocaine). The catalytic efficiency parameters (kcat and KM) of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and two mutants (known as cocaine hydrolases E14-3 and E12-7) against norcocaethylene have been characterized in the present study for the first time, and they are compared with those against cocaine. According to the obtained kinetic data, wild-type human BChE showed a similar catalytic efficiency against norcocaethylene (kcat = 9.5 min-1, KM = 11.7 μM, and kcat/KM = 8.12 × 105 M-1 min-1) to that against (-)-cocaine (kcat = 4.1 min-1, KM = 4.5 μM, and kcat/KM = 9.1 × 105 M-1 min-1). E14-3 and E12-7 showed an improved catalytic activity against norcocaethylene compared to wild-type BChE. E12-7 showed a 39-fold improved catalytic efficiency against norcocaethylene (kcat = 210 min-1, KM = 6.6 μM, and kcat/KM = 3.18 × 107 M-1 min-1). It has been demonstrated that E12-7 as an exogenous enzyme can efficiently metabolize norcocaethylene in rats. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The deleterious effects of nerve agents over the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) turned these compounds into the most dangerous chemical weapons known. Among the antidotes in use today against these agents, oximes in combination with other drugs are the only treatment with any action. HI-6 and 2-PAM are cationic oximes proved to be effective for the reactivation of AChE inhibited by the nerve agents VX and sarin (GB). However, when it comes to reactivation of AChE inside the central or peripheral nervous systems, charged molecules present low diffusion due to low penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Uncharged oximes appear as an interesting alternative to solve this problem, but the development and enhancement of more efficient uncharged oximes capable of reactivating human AChE is still necessary. Given the limitations for in vivo and in vitro experimental studies with nerve agents, modeling is an important tool that can contribute to a better understanding of factors that may affect the efficiency of uncharged oximes. In order to investigate the interaction and behavior of cationic and uncharged oximes, we performed here molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding energies calculations of the known cationic oximes HI-6 and 2-PAM plus four uncharged oximes found in the literature, complexed with human AChE (HssACHE) conjugated with the nerve agents VX and GB. The uncharged oximes showed different behaviors, especially RS194B, which presented stability inside AChE-VX, but presented free binding energy lower than cationic oximes, suggesting that structural alterations could favor its interactions with these complexes. In contrast, HI-6 and 2-PAM showed higher affinities with more negative binding energy values and larger contribution of the amino acid Asp74, demonstrating the importance of the quaternary nitrogen to the affinity and interaction of oximes with AChE-GB and AChE-VX conjugates. © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites that are found ubiquitously in plants, fruits, and vegetables. Many studies have shown that regular consumption of these compounds could have a positive effect on our health. The aim of this study was to compare the phytochemical contents of the water extracts from three different plants used as folk remedies in Turkey: Aesculus hippocastanum, Olea europaea, and Hypericum perforatum. A liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis was performed to explore the phenolic profiles. The biological activities of these extracts were also evaluated in terms of their antioxidant activities (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH, 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid ABTS, Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power Assay FRAP, cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity CUPRAC, β-carotene, phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating) and enzyme inhibitory properties (against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase). The aqueous extract of H. perforatum showed the highest levels of total phenolic, flavonoid, and saponin contents. Protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, verbascoside, hesperidin, hyperoside, apigenin 7-hexosides, and quercetin were the most common compounds found in this species. The results confirm that A. hippocastanum, O. europaea, and H. perforatum represent a potential source of natural-derived molecules with positive properties that could be used as valid starting point for new food supplements, and drugs in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Over recent decades, crystallographic software for data processing and structure refinement has improved dramatically, resulting in more accurate and detailed crystal structures. It is, therefore, sometimes valuable to have a second look at "old" diffraction data, especially when earlier interpretation of the electron density maps was rather difficult. Here, we present updated crystal structures of Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase (DmAChE) originally published in [Harel et al., Prot Sci (2000) 9:1063-1072], which reveal features previously unnoticed. Thus, previously unmodeled density in the native active site can be interpreted as stable acetylation of the catalytic serine. Similarly, a strong density in the DmAChE/ZA complex originally attributed to a sulfate ion is better interpreted as a small molecule that is covalently bound. This small molecule can be modeled as either a propionate or a glycinate. The complex is reminiscent of the carboxylate butyrylcholinesterase complexes observed in crystal structures of human butyrylcholinesterases from various sources, and demonstrates the remarkable ability of cholinesterases to stabilize covalent complexes with carboxylates. A very strong peak of density (10 σ) at covalent distance from the Cβ of the catalytic serine is present in the DmAChE/ZAI complex. This can be undoubtedly attributed to an iodine atom, suggesting an unanticipated iodo/hydroxyl exchange between Ser238 and the inhibitor, possibly driven by the intense X-ray irradiation. Finally, the binding of tacrine-derived inhibitors, such as ZA (1DX4) or the iodinated analog, ZAI (1QON) results in the appearance of an open channel that connects the base of the active-site gorge to the solvent. This channel, which arises due to the absence of the conserved tyrosine present in vertebrate cholinesterases, could be exploited to design inhibitors specific to insect cholinesterases. The present study demonstrates that updated processing of older diffraction images, and the re-refinement of older diffraction data, can produce valuable information that could not be detected in the original analysis, and strongly supports the preservation of the diffraction images in public data banks. © 2020 by the authors.},

The synthesized compounds were structurally characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy and were screened against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzyme inhibition activities. Molecular docking studies, drug-like profiling and kinetic analysis were performed to further investigate the inhibition mechanism of the compounds. This study provided useful insights into the design and development of novel dual inhibitors, in addition to understanding the mechanism by which such drugs interact with targets and exert their biochemical action. All the compounds showed superior inhibition profile compared to the standards possessing sub-micromolar and micromolar IC50 values for AChE and BChE, respectively. Docking simulations revealed that the compound 6g showed strong binding inside the active site gorges of both AChE and BChE. An excellent agreement was obtained as the best docked poses showed important binding features mostly based on interactions due to aromatic moieties and oxygen atoms of the compound. Cation-pi/pi-pi interactions together with hydrogen bond forces were the key players responsible for ligand anchoring in the active sites. The striking results accomplished both in docking computations and experimental findings ascertained that the compound 6g can serve as a scaffold for both AChE and BChE inhibition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) sans inhibitor and in complex with each of 15 dialkyl phenyl phosphate derivatives were conducted to characterize inhibitor binding modes and strengths. Each system was sampled on the 250 ns timescale in explicit ionic solvent, for a total of over 4 μs of simulation time. A K-means algorithm was used to cluster the resulting structures into distinct binding modes, which were further characterized based on atomic-level contacts between inhibitor chemical groups and active site residues. Comparison of experimentally observed inhibition constants (KI) with the resulting contact tables provides structural explanations for relative binding coefficients and highlights several notable interaction motifs. These include ubiquitous contact between glycines in the oxyanion hole and the inhibitor phosphate group; a sterically driven binding preference for positional isomers that extend aromaticity; a stereochemical binding preference for choline-containing inhibitors, which mimic natural BChE substrates; and the mechanically induced opening of the omega loop region to fully expose the active site gorge in the presence of choline-containing inhibitors. Taken together, these observations can greatly inform future design of BChE inhibitors, and the approach reported herein is generalizable to other enzyme–inhibitor systems and similar complexes that depend on non-covalent molecular recognition.

abstract={Recent malicious use of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) is a reminder of their severity and ongoing threat. One of the main categories of CWAs is the organophosphate (OP) nerve agents. Presently, there is an urgent need to identify and evaluate OP nerve agent biomarkers that can facilitate identification of exposed individuals post-CWA incident. While exposures to OP nerve agents may be scenario-specific, the public is commonly exposed to OP compounds through the ubiquitous use of OP pesticides, which are chemically related to nerve agents. Therefore, a systematic literature review and methodological quality assessment were conducted for OP pesticide biomarker studies to serve as a baseline to assess if these approaches may be adapted to OP nerve agent exposures. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify biomarkers of OP pesticide exposures. English language studies of any design that reported primary data on biomarkers for exposures in nonhuman primates or adult human study participants were eligible for inclusion. Using standard criteria for assessing the completeness of reported analytical methods, the quality of study methods was critically evaluated. Results: A total of 1,044 studies of biomarkers of OP pesticide exposure were identified, of which 75 articles satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies described 143 different analyte/sample matrix combinations: 99 host-based biomarkers, 28 metabolites, 12 pesticides, and 4 adducts. The most commonly reported biomarkers were dialkyl phosphate urinary metabolites (22 studies), blood acetylcholinesterase, and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (26 studies each). None of the assessed quality review criteria were fully addressed by all identified studies, with almost all criteria scoring less than 50%. Conclusion: Cholinesterase activity may have utility for identifying individuals with exposures surpassing a given threshold of OP nerve agent, but further investigation of how acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase levels correlate with observed patient symptoms may be required to ensure accuracy of results. As CWAs and nerve agents are more readily used, more standardized reporting of biomarker measurements are needed to develop new approaches for OP nerve agent biomarkers. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

abstract={Substance abuse places a great burden on associated families, communities, and the health care sector. Drug addiction leads to physical traumas, psychiatric disorders, and other neuronal disorders; it causes millions of deaths per year. The rehabilitation in the respective cases includes complex therapeutic treatments along with other measures for recovery. Substance abuse brings about neurochemical imbalances in the brain and develops mainly due to disorders in the dopamine, serotonin, cannabinoid, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptor systems. Cholinergic neurons are in abundance among all other types of neurons in the brain. During recent time, cross-talks and co-existence of more than one receptor have attracted attention from the scientific community. In addition, a growing preclinical literature reveals a critical role of acetylcholine (ACh) in the experience and progression of the drug use. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), an enzyme structurally homologous to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), also targets acetylcholine (ACh) and has been implicated in the metabolism of cocaine, heroin, succinylcholine esters, and many other drugs. In addition, the activity of the above enzymes has been associated with neuronal disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease and other psychiatric conditions, in particular depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, etc., and is also involved in some metabolic diseases. The multifaceted neuronal and non-neuronal aspects demand a review of the role of BChE in substance abuse, which has practically not been addressed in the literature, except cocaine addiction. This overview emphasizes and integrates the putative role of BChE in substance abuse. The research gap and future trend of research in addiction therapy will be highlighted. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Our aim was to find chlorine-substituted antidotes against organophosphate poisoning and compare their pharmacokinetics to their parent compound, K-203. White male Wistar rats were intramuscularly injected with K-203, K-867 or K-870. Serum, brain, kidneys, liver, lung, eyes, and testes tissues were taken after 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min and analyzed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. K-203, K-867, or K-870 was present in every tissue that was analyzed, including the serum, the eyes, testes, liver, kidneys, lungs, and the brain. The serum levels of K-867 and K-870 (chlorine-substituted derivatives of K-203) were nearly constant between 15 and 30 min, while their parent compound (K-203) showed peak level at 15 min after the administration of 30 µmol/rat. Neither K-203, nor K-867 or K-870 were toxic at a dose of 100 µmol/200 g in rats. Chlorine-substitution of K-867 and K-870 produced limited absorbance and distribution compared to their parent compound, K203. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={The aim of this experiment was to study the effects of calcium ion on the hydrolysis of cationic and anionic substrate by human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE). The hydrolysis of aspirin, an anionic substrate, by HuBChE was markedly increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of calcium ion (∼20 mM), as shown by the increasing kcat (∼18-fold). Butyrylthiocholine (BTC), a cationic substrate, was biphasically hydrolyzed with substrate activation; a second BTC molecule caused a 3-fold increase in kcat. At both lower and higher concentrations of BTC, its hydrolysis by HuBChE was slightly slowed down by the addition of calcium ion. Other cationic substrates, propranolol derivatives with butyryl and valeryl groups, were R-preferentially hydrolyzed by HuBChE; the rate of hydrolysis of these compounds was nearly the same in the absence and presence of calcium ion. These data indicate differential effects of calcium ion on HuBChE activity with anionic and cationic substrates. Furthermore, during the hydrolysis of aspirin in the presence of calcium ions, we demonstrated the existence of 2 additional binding sites for calcium, with Km values of 1.8 and 5.9 mM. These binding sites exhibited much lower affinities than the EF-hand motif, previously identified as a high-affinity calcium-binding site. © 2020 American Pharmacists Association®},

abstract={Chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs) present a global threat to both military and civilian populations. The acute toxicity of CWNAs stems from their ability to effectively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This inhibition can lead to uncontrolled cholinergic cellular signaling, resulting in cholinergic crisis and, ultimately, death. Although the current FDA-approved standard of care is moderately effective when administered early, development of novel treatment strategies is necessary. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an enzyme which displays a high degree of structural homology to AChE. Unlike AChE, the roles of BChE are uncertain and possibilities are still being explored. However, BChE appears to primarily serve as a bioscavenger of toxic esters due to its ability to accommodate a wide variety of substrates within its active site. Like AChE, BChE is also readily inhibited by CWNAs. Due to its high affinity for binding CWNAs, and that null-BChE yields no apparent health effects, exogenous BChE has been explored as a candidate therapeutic for CWNA intoxication. Despite years of research, minimal strides have been made to develop a catalytic bioscavenger. Furthermore, BChE is only in early clinical trials as a stoichiometric bioscavenger of CWNAs, and large quantities must be administered to treat CWNA toxicity. Here, we describe previously unidentified mutations to residues within and adjacent to the acyl binding pocket (positions 282-285 were mutagenized from YGTP to NHML) of BChE that confer catalytic degradation of the CWNA, sarin. These mutations, along with corresponding future efforts, may finally lead to a novel therapeutic to combat CWNA intoxication. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.},

The strategy for this synthesis was based on aldol condensation reaction between 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde with 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone in the presence of NaOH in EtOH-H2O solution as the first step and N-alkylation reaction of the produced 5,6-dimethoxy-2-[(pyridin-4-yl)methylene]-1-indanone with various alkyl halides (R–X) in the second step. This reaction was carried out under reflux temperature in polar aprotic solvents such as acetone or acetonitrile. 1H and 13C NMR and FTIR spectroscopy along with CHN analysis were used to confirm the structure of our synthesized compounds. Biological activities including acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitions for synthesized compounds were tested using the Ellman method. The results were compared with donepezil and galantamine, and among the synthesized compounds, the highest inhibitory activity with BuChE IC50 = 0.55 μM was observed.

abstract={Abstract: The regularities of the functioning of a number of enzymes in a viscous environment created by natural polymers, starch and gelatin are examined. Based on the analysis of kinetic curves of thermal inactivation, mechanisms of thermal inactivation of enzymes in a viscous microenvironment are proposed. Using the example of butyrylcholinesterase, NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase, and coupled system of the luminous bacteria (NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase + luciferase), the conditions, under which starch and gelatin have a stabilizing effect on enzyme activity during storage and exposure to various physical and chemical environmental factors, were found. A significant increase in the stabilizing effect is achieved by eliminating water during drying the enzyme preparations immobilized in starch and gelatin polymer gels. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={In this study, Grewia optiva Drummond ex Burret root extracts were assessed for use as a remedy for oxidative stress, diabetes mellitus and neurological disorders. The antioxidative potentials of the extracts were determined using DPPH and ABTS assays, whereas their enzyme inhibitory potentials were determined against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-glucosidase and α-amylase. In the in vivo experiments, methanol extract was orally administered to mice (n = 5) at four doses of 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg kg-1 for 30 days and its effect on glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, etc. were investigated. The highest free radical scavenging activities against DPPH and ABTS radicals were recorded for the methanol and ethyl acetate extracts, and their respective IC50 values were 75 and 88 μg/mL. In addition, these two fractions were highly active in inhibiting AChE and BChE, with IC50 values of 120 and 185 μg/mL, respectively. Moderate inhibition (μg/mL) was recorded against α-glucosidase (69.02 ± 1.02 and 64.29 ± 2.41) and α-amylase (65.12 ± 2.02 and 63.29 ± 1.41) and these were comparable to the inhibitory activities exhibited by the standard, acarbose. All the extracts showed high phenolic and flavonoid contents, which correlated with their antioxidant, anticholinesterase, α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities. The phenolic compounds in the crude extract and fractions were determined using the standard HPLC method and bioactive compounds, namely, morin, ellagic acid, kaempferol-3-(p-coumaroyl-diglucoside)-7-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, quercetin-3-(caffeoyl-diglucoside)-7-glucoside, etc., which were detected at various retention times. Significant decrease in cholesterol, triglyceride and blood glucose levels were observed. G. optiva is a good source of antioxidants and other phytochemicals, some of which possess anticholinesterase, anti-glucosidase, and anti-amylase activities, and can be used to treat different health conditions such as oxidative stress, neurological disorders, and diabetes mellitus. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Rivastigmine has been prescribed for the therapy of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) symptoms. This drug is classified in the carbamate derivative group that has dual activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). According to the structure of Rivastigmine and its performance, a new series of 5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-carbamothioate compounds I–XI was synthesized using structure-based drug discovery approaches. For this purpose a set of these compounds were designed with computational docking method and their interactions with amino acid residues in the active sites of AChE and BuChE checked out. The structures of synthesized compounds were established by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. The carbamoyl moiety of Rivastigmine structure was modified to carbamothioate and the effects of 1,3,4-oxadiazole heterocycle as a pharmacophoric nucleus were investigated. The potential of the synthesized compounds I–XI was evaluated against two most known agents of AD (AChE and BuChE) to determine their IC50 values. The results of the docking showed the range of binding affinity for the best poses of ten individual conformers for any compounds (I–XI) was between −7.81 (VI) and −6.75 (II) kcal/mol. The results of biological experiments displayed that most synthetic compounds (I–VIII) showed moderate to excellent selective activity range against BuChE (0.51–69.44 µM). In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of these compounds (I–XI) by MTT assay on human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cell line exhibited no activity against HDF. The compound VI [S-(5-(p-tolyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) ethyl(methyl)carbamothioate] showed the most stable binding affinity (−7.81 kcal/mol) and the lowest IC50 value (0.51 µM) in comparison with Rivastigmine with 7.72 µM and Donepezil with 5.20 µM against BuChE. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Chronic occupational exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) is consistently associated with deficits on behavioral tests when compared to unexposed comparison groups. However, a dose-response relationship has yet to be established, leading some to doubt an association between occupational OP exposure and behavioral deficits. Pesticide application teams in Egypt who are primarily exposed to one OP, chlorpyrifos (CPF), were recruited into a field assessment. Trail Making A and the more challenging Trail Making B tests were administered to 54 engineers (who supervise the pesticide application process, usually from the side of the field), 59 technicians (who guide the pesticide applicators in the field), 31 applicators (who mix and apply pesticides using knapsack sprayers), and 150 controls (who did not work in the fields) at two different times during the OP application season as well as immediately after applications had ended and 1.5 months later. All participants were males since only males work on pesticide application teams in Egypt. Urinary levels of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), a specific metabolite of CPF, confirmed the pattern of lower to higher CPF exposures from engineers to technicians to applicators, and these were all greater than urinary metabolite levels in controls. A consistent relationship between job title and performance speed on the behavioral task was observed: Controls had the best (fastest) performance on Trail Making A and B tests throughout the application season, and applicators had significantly slower performance than engineers on Trail Making A (p = 0.015) and B (p = 0.003). However, individual urinary TCPy, blood acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) levels did not predict individual performance. This study identifies a dose-related effect based on job title, which serves as a surrogate for chronic exposure in that differing job titles exhibit varying group exposure levels. The results establish that chronic occupational exposure to chlorpyrifos is neurotoxic and suggest that the classic biomarkers of recent CPF exposure are not predictive of chronic exposure effects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Uncaria alkaloids are the major bioactive chemicals found in the Uncaria genus, which have a long history of clinical application in treating cardiovascular and mental diseases in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, there are gaps in understanding the multiple targets, pathways, and biological activities of Uncaria alkaloids. By constructing the interactions among drug‐targets‐diseases, network pharmacology provides a systemic methodology and a novel perspective to present the intricate connections among drugs, potential targets, and related pathways. It is a valuable tool for studying TCM drugs with multiple indications, and how these multi‐indication drugs are affected by complex interactions in the biological system. To better understand the mechanisms and targets of Uncaria alkaloids, we built an integrated analytical platform based on network pharmacology, including target prediction, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, topology analysis, gene enrichment analysis, and molecular docking. Using this platform, we revealed the underlying mechanisms of Uncaria alkaloids’ anti‐hypertensive effects and explored the possible application of Uncaria alkaloids in preventing Alzheimer’s disease. These results were further evaluated and refined using biological experiments. Our study provides a novel strategy for understanding the holistic pharmacology of TCM, as well as for exploring the multi-indication properties of TCM beyond its traditional applications. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Leaf-cutter ants are agricultural and urban pests that defy chemical control methods. Laboratory and field studies have revealed repellent and insecticidal activity by the extracts of Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae), known as Mexican sunflower, as a promising alternative for the control of the leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes. This study evaluated the effects of different extracts (non-polar and polar) of T. diversifolia dry leaves on worker ants from laboratory colonies of A. cephalotes through ingestion and contact. In addition, the biological activity of the extracts as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) was evaluated. A dichloromethane extract at 1000 ppm presented the highest insecticidal activity through ingestion, causing 70% and 90% worker ant mortality after five and seven days of treatment, respectively. The acetylcholinesterase inhibition values showed that the dichloromethane presented the best AChE concentration of inhibition (IC50) at 73.9 ± 11.06 μg/mL, compared to its fractions, which demonstrates that its activity is potentiated when the crude extract is used. Our results can be attributed to the existence of terpenes and sesquiterpene lactones, which are likely inhibitors of AChE, in T. diversifolia. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is considered one of the greatest global public burdens. Pathophysiology of AD is proposed to be associated with reduced levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Cholinesterase enzymes, namely acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) cleave ACh via hydrolysis. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are the main group of drugs currently used for the treatment of AD. Novel chromone-2-carboxamido-alkylamines (7–18) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The compounds exhibited potent AChE inhibitory activities at micromolar range (IC50 0.09–9.16 µM) and demonstrated weak BChE inhibitory activities (IC50 12.09–44.56 µM). Compound 14 (IC50 0.09 ± 0.02 µM) was the most potent AChEI in this series; it showed higher activity than the clinical used drug tacrine. Enzyme kinetic study suggested that 14 was an uncompetitive inhibitor. Molecular docking study revealed that 14 was a dual-binding site inhibitor. Compound 14 did not induce any concentration-related cytotoxic effect against SH-SY5Y cells. It also showed neuroprotective effect in the cell line. Chromone-2-carboxamido-alkylamines can be promising lead compounds for development of anti-Alzheimer’s agents. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an annual plant cultivated in spring or autumn. Currently, over 70% of the cultivated barley grains are utilized for preparing fodder, while the rest is used for the production of malt and cereals in the food industry. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the content of bioactive compounds, antioxidant potential, and cholinesterase inhibitory effect of the aqueous extracts of juvenile barley leaves. It was found that the barley cultivars differed in their content of the determined phytochemicals as well as their antioxidant potential and cholinesterase-inhibitory activity. The water extracts of young barley leaves contained phenolic acids as well as quercetin, rutin, and kaempferitrin. The extracts showed a higher inhibitory effect on 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) than on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals. Based on the aqueous extracts analyzed, we found that winter cultivars were characterized by the highest iron-chelating activity. Furthermore, barley extracts showed a stronger inhibitory effect against acetylcholinesterase compared to butyrylcholinesterase. The results of the present work indicated that barley cultivars differed in their germination process. Among the tested samples, the highest cholinesterase inhibitory activity was shown by the Basic variety. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Organophosphorus (OP) compounds, which include insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs) such as sarin (GB) and VX, continue to be a global threat to both civilian and military populations. It is widely accepted that cholinesterase inhibition is the primary mechanism for acute OP toxicity. Disruption of cholinergic function through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) leads to the accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Excess acetylcholine at the synapse results in an overstimulation of cholinergic neurons which manifests in the common signs and symptoms of OP intoxication (miosis, increased secretions, seizures, convulsions, and respiratory failure). The primary therapeutic strategy employed in the United States to treat OP intoxication includes reactivation of inhibited AChE with the oxime pralidoxime (2-PAM) along with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist atropine and the benzodiazepine, diazepam. CWNAs are also known to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) without any apparent toxic effects. Therefore, BChE may be viewed as a "bioscavenger" that stoichiometrically binds CWNAs and removes them from circulation. The degree of inhibition of AChE and BChE and the effectiveness of 2-PAM are known to vary among species. Animal models are imperative for evaluating the efficacy of CWNA medical countermeasures, and a thorough characterization of available animal models is important for translating results to humans. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the circulating levels of each of the cholinesterases as well as multiple kinetic properties (inhibition, reactivation, and aging rates) of both AChE and BChE derived from humans to AChE and BChE derived from commonly used large animal models. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.},

abstract={The purpose of the current study was to examine the neuroprotective effect of rutin against colistin-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Thirty-five male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups. The control group (orally received physiological saline), the rutin group (orally administered 100 mg/kg body weight), the colistin group (i.p. administered 15 mg/kg body weight), the Col + Rut 50 group (i.p. administered 15 mg/kg body weight of colistin, and orally received 50 mg/kg body weight of rutin), the Col + Rut 100 group (i.p. administered 15 mg/kg body weight of colistin, and orally received 100 mg/kg body weight of rutin). Administration of colistin increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities while decreasing level of cyclic AMP response element binding protein and extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) expressions. Colistin increased oxidative impairments as evidenced by a decrease in level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), glutathione, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities, and increased malondialdehyde content. Colistin also increased the levels of the apoptotic and inflammatoric parameters such as cysteine aspartate specific protease-3 (caspase-3), p53, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Rutin treatment restored the brain function by attenuating colistin-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, histopathological and immunohistochemical alteration suggesting that rutin supplementation mitigated colistin-induced neurotoxicity in male rats. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological degenerative disease that has complex pathogenesis. A variety of studies in humans indicate that several enzymes inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of AD, including acetylcholinesterase (AchE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Various substituted 4-arylcoumarin derivatives were synthesised, and their activity in vitro were investigated, including AChE/BuChE inhibitory activity, MAO inhibitory activity, and antioxidant activity. Most of the compounds were found to exhibit high inhibitory activity, and individual compounds have extremely excellent activities.

abstract={Dantrolene, the only therapeutic agent for malignant hyperthermia, is known to have not only a muscle relaxant effect, but also a neuroprotective effect and Alzheimer's disease improving effect. Recently, it has been reported that dantrolene has a weak inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is a therapeutic drug target for Alzheimer's disease. Thus, we focused on developing of AChE inhibitors with benzylpiperidine/piperazine moieties that are based on the dantrolene skeleton. Several derivatives showed an inhibitory activity. Among them, ortho-nitro derivative 8c showed the most potent inhibitory activity with the IC50 value of 34.2 nM. Furthermore, Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis indicated that 8c is AChE-selective inhibitor, which shows only a weak inhibitory effect on butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and a non-competitive inhibition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sideritis, also named “ironwort,” “mountain tea,” or “shepherd's tea,” is a genus of flowering plants used as herbal medicine in traditional Mediterranean-area medicine systems, and these plants are generally consumed as a herbal tea. Its use as herbal tea and in traditional herbal medicine is quite popular. There are currently few studies on Sideritis perfoliata L., and only one reports the use of a liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MSn) profile and the content of phenolic compounds without considering a possible correlation with its biological activities. This paper aims to investigate the antioxidant activities by means of several different biological/biochemical assays (radical scavenging, reducing power, ferrous ion chelating, and total antioxidant by phosphomolybdenum and β-carotene bleaching methods) as well as analyze the enzyme inhibitory activities (against AChE (acetylcholinesterase), BChE (butyrylcholinesterase), tyrosinase, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase) as well as the total phenolics, flavonoids, and condensed tannins. The reported results on Sideritis perfoliata highlighted that methanol and water extracts generally showed higher radical scavenging and reducing power activities. A similar trend could be observed for phosphomolybdenum and ferrous ion chelating activities. Methanol extracts showed lower activity only for the β-carotene bleaching assay. © Copyright © 2020 Sarikurkcu, Locatelli, Mocan, Zengin and Kirkan.},

abstract={Pellets with an immobilized enzyme (acetyl- or butyrylcholinesterase) are the up-to-date type of carriers used for the detection of nerve agents (soman, sarin, tabun, VX, Novichok) and other cholinesterase inhibitors such as organophosphate and carbamate insecticides (parathion, malathion). They are used in the glass detection tubes as a layer containing the enzyme together with the second layer, which contains a colorimetric reagent and substrate. The detection method is based on the visually or spectrophotometrically observable Ellman's reaction, which develops a yellow color in the absence of the cholinesterase inhibitor; otherwise, the detector preserves its original color (preferably white). This reaction occurs very fast and has a high sensitivity to nerve agents but it suffers from an indistinctive color transition from white to yellow. In the presented study, a new approach with the use of the synergic effect of magnesium aluminometasilicate with a high surface area marketed as Neusilin®US2 and a protective semipermeable Eudragit® RL layer was utilized. The prepared pellets have been evaluated for their properties such as the activity of the enzyme, intensity of the developed yellow color, sensitivity to cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine, which acts as a nerve agent simulant, and physical parameters such as hardness, pycnometric density and sphericity. After the initial evaluation, all samples underwent a stability test under three different storage conditions for 24 months during which they were evaluated at given time points (0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months). It was found that the prepared samples achieved a much higher intensity of developed yellow color than in the published studies while maintaining similar or better sensitivity, speed of detection and suitable physico-chemical properties. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

All compounds showed dual anti-aggregating properties towards Aβ and tau protein in the in cellulo assay in Escherichia coli. Of particular interest are compounds 24b and 25b, which efficiently inhibit aggregation of Aβ and tau protein at 10 μM (24b: 45% for Aβ, 53% for tau; 25b: 49% for Aβ, 54% for tau). They display free radical scavenging capacity and antioxidant activity in ABTS and FRAP assays, respectively, and selectively chelate copper ions. Compounds 24b and 25b are also the most potent inhibitors of BuChE with IC50 of 2.39 μM and 1.94 μM, respectively.

abstract={Cholines acylated with unsaturated fatty acids are a recently discovered family of endogenous lipids. However, the data on the biological activity of acylcholines remain very limited. We hypothesized that acylcholines containing residues of arachidonic (AA-CHOL), oleic (Ol- CHOL), linoleic (Ln-CHOL), and docosahexaenoic (DHA-CHOL) acids act as modulators of the acetylcholine signaling system. In the radioligand binding assay, acylcholines showed inhibition in the micromolar range of both α7 neuronal nAChR overexpressed in GH4C1 cells and muscle type nAChR from Torpedo californica, as well as Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine binding protein. Functional response was checked in two cell lines endogenously expressing α7 nAChR. In SH-SY5Y cells, these compounds did not induce Ca2+ rise, but inhibited the acetylcholine-evoked Ca2+ rise with IC50 9 to 12 μM. In the A549 lung cancer cells, where α7 nAChR activation stimulates proliferation, Ol-CHOL, Ln-CHOL, and AA-CHOL dose-dependently decreased cell viability by up to 45%. AA-CHOL inhibited human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by a mixed type mechanism with Ki = 16.7 ± 1.5 μM and αKi = 51.4 ± 4.1 μM for AChE and Ki = 70.5 ± 6.3 μM and αKi = 214 ± 17 μM for BChE, being a weak substrate of the last enzyme only, agrees with molecular docking results. Thus, long-chain unsaturated acylcholines could be viewed as endogenous modulators of the acetylcholine signaling system. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In the present study, the essential oil and aroma compositions of Nepeta heliotropifolia (NH) and N. congesta subsp. cryptantha (NC) were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC/FID), and their phenolic compounds by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In addition, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anticholinesterase, urease, and tyrosinase activities of essential oils obtained from NH and NC aerial parts and ethanol extracts prepared from different parts of NH and NC were investigated. The major constituent of water-distilled essential oils was found to be germacrene D (36.7% and 38.5%, respectively), and their main aroma component was eucalyptol (48.0% and 24.7%, respectively). Among the studied parts of NH and NC, their flowers extracts were found to be the richest in phenolic compounds and in which the most abundant compound was rosmarinic acid (8,909.91 and 4,317.20 μg/g, respectively). NH and NC flower extracts exhibited also strong antioxidant activity in DPPH, ABTS, and CUPRAC assays. Among the tested samples, NH essential oil indicated the best cytotoxic effect against PDF, HT-29, and MCF-7 (IC50 52.34, 25.89, and 44.70 μg/ml, respectively), and the highest butyrylcholinesterase (77.21 ± 1.12% inhibition) and moderate acetylcholinesterase (41.36 ± 0.69% inhibition) inhibitory activities. Practical applications: This is the first report on the essential oil and aroma compositions, the phenolic compounds, the antioxidant with total phenolic and flavonoid contents, cytotoxic, anticholinesterase, urease, and tyrosinase activities of Nepeta heliotropifolia and N. congesta subsp. cryptantha, except for their essential oil compositions. The reported results suggested that Nepeta heliotropifolia and N. congesta subsp. cryptantha flowers being rich in rosmarinic acid and having strong antioxidant potential, and NH essential oil possessing significant cytotoxic and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory effect could be source for nutraceutical, food, and drug industries. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Compound 3d exhibited remarkable neuroprotective effect and hepatoprotective activity. In addition, compound 3d presented favourable blood-brain barrier penetration in vitro and drug-like property. Further, the in vivo assay displayed that 3d indicated remarkable dyskinesia recovery rate and response efficiency on AD zebrafish, and exhibited surprising protective effect on Aβ1-40-mediated zebrafish vascular injury. More importantly, 3d did not indicate obvious acute toxicity at dose up to 2000 mg/kg, and could improve scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Subsequently, the regulation of multi-targets for 3d were further confirmed through transcriptome sequencing of brain hippocampi, which also offered novel potential targets and opened a new way to treat Alzheimer's disease. More interestingly, the metabolism of 3d in vitro indicated that 4 metabolites in rat liver microsome metabolism, 2 metabolites in human liver microsome metabolism, and 4 metabolites in intestinal flora metabolism, which offered supports for the preclinical study of 3d.

abstract={Bridelia species have been used in traditional African medicine for the management of diverse human ailments. In the current work, the detailed phytochemical profiles of the extracts of the stem bark of B. speciosa were evaluated and the antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory properties of the extracts were assessed. The anti-bacterial and anti-mycotic effects of the extracts were evaluated against selected pathogen strains. Additionally, the anti-proliferative effects were studied on the liver cancer HepG2 cell line. Finally, the putative protective effects were assessed on isolated rat liver that was challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results revealed the presence of 36 compounds in the ethyl acetate extract, 44 in the methanol extract, and 38 in the water extract. Overall, the methanol extract showed the highest antioxidant activity, particularly in LPS-stimulated rat liver. Additionally, this extract exerted the highest antimycotic effect on C. albicans, whereas the water extract showed a promising anti-proliferative effect on liver cancer HepG2 cells. The methanol extract was also the most active as enzyme inhibitor, against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. The current study appraises the antioxidant and enzyme inhibition properties of B. speciosa methanol extract and showed that this specie could be a promising source of biologically active phytochemicals, with potential health uses. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Introduction: “Aerotoxic syndrome” is a debated entity. Regulatory authorities consider long-term health effects to be an unlikely consequence of exposure to contaminated air because several air quality monitoring studies report low concentrations of toxic chemicals in cabin air. We describe two pilots and one flight attendant, who developed ill health during their flying career which improved after cessation of flying. Case details: The most frequently reported symptoms were headache, balance problems, fatigue, gastro-intestinal complaints and cognitive impairment. One of these patients had reduced levels of butyrylcholinesterase after a flight suggesting exposure to organophosphate compounds had occurred. All three were found to have elevated neuronal and glial auto-antibodies, biomarkers of central nervous system injury, and all three had genetic polymorphisms of paraoxonase (PON-1) and two of cytochrome P450, leading to a reduced ability to metabolize organophosphate compound (OPs). Discussion: A similar constellation of symptoms has been described in other studies of aircrew, although objective evidence of exposure is lacking in most of these studies. Reduced levels of butyrylcholinesterases in one of our cases is suggestive of causation and elevated neuronal and glial autoantibodies provide objective evidence of damage to the central nervous system. We consider further research is warranted. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Cakile maritima Scop. (sea rocket) is an edible halophyte plant with several ethnomedicinal uses. This work reports the chemical profile and bioactivities of food grade extracts from sea rocket organs. Toxicity was determined on mammalian cells, and phenolic profiling and the quantitation of the main metabolites were made by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Enzymatic inhibition was determined towards acetyl-and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE, BuChE), α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and tyrosinase. Docking studies were performed to tyrosinase, on the major metabolites, and samples were tested for antioxidant properties. Extracts were not toxic, were constituted mainly by flavonoids, and some compounds (roseoside and oleuropein) are here described for the first time in the species. The aerial organs’ ethanol extract had relevant activity towards 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 0.59 mg/mL], and ferric-reducing activity power (FRAP, IC50 = 0.99 mg/mL). All samples were more active towards AChE than on BuChE. The ethanol fruits’ extract inhibited α-glucosidase [2.19 mmol of equivalent of acarbose (ACAE)/g]. Samples were active against tyrosinase, especially the aerial organs’ ethanol extracts [25.9 mg of equivalent of kojic acid (KAE)/g]. Quercetin and kaempferol glycosides fit well into the enzymatic pocket of tyrosinase. Our results suggest sea rocket as a candidate to be further explored as a source of bioactive products. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Generally, O. sericea showed stronger antioxidant activity, while O. stenoloba extract exhibited stronger enzyme inhibitory abilities (cholinesterases and α-amylase). The protective effects of extracts, at the concentration range from 25 to 400 μg/mL, against hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage were dose-dependent, increasing with a higher dosage. The extracts at the highest concentration (80 mg/mL) showed the absence of genotoxicity in vivo. Antigenotoxic effects were evident after treatment with both extracts, with a percentage reduction of over 80 %. Overall antimicrobial activity of studied extracts was weak, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration values (MIC) of 2.5 mg/mL.

abstract={In the present study, we aimed to search and compare the biological activities of the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), and ethylacetate (EtOAc) solvent extracts of the flower, stem, and root parts of two Helichrysum plants (H. chionophilum (Hc) and H. plicatum subsp. plicatum (Hp)). The antioxidant properties were determined by using (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) (DPPH) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays. The enzyme inhibitory effects of the extracts were investigated on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), α-glucosidase, and α-amylase. Palmitic acid (C 16:0) was also determined as major fatty acids in the tested oils (31.21%–67.68%). In both plants, it was found that the EtOAc extracts of the flowers had a strong antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory effect. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study showed that H. chionophilum and H. plicatum can be seen as a promising source for the natural bioactive compounds that can be used in therapeutic applications. Practical applications: The members of the genus Helichrysum have been widely taken for therapeutic purposes in traditional medicine as well as food. In this context, we investigated the chemical characterization and biological activities of two Helichrysum species extracts (H. chionophilum and H. plicatum subsp. plicatum). Antioxidant capacity, enzyme inhibition and anti-microbial effects were tested for biological activities. Chemical characterization was identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (for phenolic) and gas chromatography-flame ioanization detector (GC-FID) (for fatty acids).

In silico study on the inhibition of tyrosinase and α-amylase was also performed. Piperitone (59.1%) and isomers of para-menthadienols (35.3%) were the main compounds in C. schoenanthus and C. nervatus oils, respectively. Oil from C. nervatus possessed higher antioxidant activity than that from C. schoenanthus except for its metal chelating ability. Both oils showed high antiproliferative activity. In silico study showed that trans-p-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol and piperitone (both isomers) revealed the best docking scores for α-amylase and tyrosinase, respectively. In conclusion, oils from these two Cymbopogon species could be new natural agents with functional properties for food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.

abstract={The halophyte species Carpobrotus edulis (L.) N.E. Br, also known as Hottentot-fig, is one of the 20 most aggressive invasive species of coastal areas worldwide. It is native to South Africa, where it is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases, including tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Aiming at a sustainable use of its biomass as a value-added product, this work reports for the first time the in vitro antioxidant, anti-microbial, enzymatic inhibitory properties and toxicity of peel and flesh extracts of Hottentot-fig mature fruits. The extracts’ chemical composition was also determined by spectrophotometric methods (total contents of phenolics: TPC; flavonoids: TFC and tannins: TTC), and by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The peels’ extracts had generally the highest TPC, TFC and TTC, especially the ethanol ones (TPC: 272.82 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry weight (DW), TFC: 1.58 mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g DW and TTC: 20.3 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/g DW). The peels’ extracts also had the highest diversity of compounds, mostly phenolic acids, flavonoids, and coumarins, as identified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Some molecules were specific to a particular fruit part, for example, coumaric acid and uvaol in the peel, and vanillin and kaempferol-O-(rhamnosyl)hexosylhexoside in the flesh. Some compounds are here described for the first time in Hottentot-fig, s uch as azelaic acid and emodin. The peel´s extracts had the highest anti radical activity, especially the ethanol and acetone towards 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.59 and 0.88 mg/mL, respectively), and the acetone extract against 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) (IC50 = 0.56 mg/mL). Samples had nil capacity to chelate iron, a low copper chelation potential, but a significant capacity to reduce iron, especially the ethanol (IC50 = 0.09 mg/mL) and the acetone extracts of peels (IC50 = 0.10 mg/mL) and flesh (IC50 = 0.11 mg/mL) and also the water peel's extracts (IC50 = 0.18 mg/mL). Samples had nil to low activity towards the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), α-amylase and α-glucosidase, but displayed a strong inhibition of tyrosinase, especially the ethanol peel's extracts (29.55 mg kojic acid equivalents (KAE)/g). Samples had nil to low in vitro toxicity towards human keratinocytes. All together our results suggests possible novel biotechnological applications of Hottentot-fig fruits as sources of innovative bioactive ingredients for the food, cosmetic, agriculture and/or pharmaceutical industries. © 2019},

abstract={Natural products have extensively contributed toward the discovery of new leads for Alzheimer's disease. During our search for new inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes from natural sources, the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of Rumex abyssinicus Jacq was identified as a dual cholinesterase inhibitor with IC50 values of 2.7 and 11.4 μg/mL against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), respectively. The phytochemical investigation of the EtOAc extract has resulted in isolation of four anthraquinones, namely, helminthosporin, emodin, chrysophanol, and physcion, amongst which the helminthosporin has been isolated for the first time from Rumex sp. All isolated secondary metabolites have displayed significant inhibition of EeAChE with IC50 values of 2.63, 15.21, 33.7, and 12.16 μM, respectively. In addition, the helminthosporin was also found to inhibit BChE with an IC50 value of 2.99 μM. The enzyme kinetic study has indicated that helminthosporin inhibits AChE and BChE in a noncompetitive manner with ki values of 10.3 and 12.3 μM, respectively. The results of molecular modeling and propidium iodide displacement assay have revealed that helminthosporin occupies the peripheral anionic site of the active site gorge of AChE. In the PAMPA-BBB permeability assay, helminthosporin was found to possess high BBB permeability (Pe = 6.16 × 10-6 cm/s). In a nutshell, helminthosporin has been identified as a brain permeable dual cholinesterase inhibitor, and thus its further synthetic exploration is warranted for optimization of its potency. © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The anesthesia awareness with recall (AAWR) phenomenon represents a complication of general anesthesia consisting of memorization of intraoperative events reported by the patient immediately after the end of surgery or at a variable distance from it. Approximately 20% of AAWR cases occur during emergence from anesthesia. Clinically, these unexpected experiences are often associated with distress especially due to a sense of paralysis. Indeed, although AAWR at the emergence has multiple causes, in the majority of cases the complication develops when the anesthesia plan is too early lightened at the end of anesthesia and there is a lack of use, or misuse, of neuromuscular monitoring with improper management of the neuromuscular block. Because the distress caused by the sense of paralysis represents an important predictor for the development of severe psychological complications, the knowledge of the phenomenon, and the possible strategies for its prophylaxis are aspects of considerable importance. Nevertheless, a limited percentage of episodes of AAWR cannot be prevented. This paradox holds also during the emergence phase of anesthesia which represents a very complex neurophysiological process with many aspects yet to be clarified. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={A newly recognized action of organophosphates (OP) is the ability to crosslink proteins through an isopeptide bond. The first step in the mechanism is covalent addition of the OP to the side chain of lysine. This activates OP-lysine for reaction with a nearby glutamic or aspartic acid to make a gamma glutamyl epsilon lysine bond. Crosslinked proteins are high molecular weight aggregates. Our goal was to identify the residues in the human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) tetramer that were crosslinked following treatment with 1.5 mM chlorpyrifos oxon. High molecular weight bands were visualized on an SDS gel. Proteins in the gel bands were digested with trypsin, separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed in an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. MSMS files were searched for crosslinked peptides using the Batch-Tag program in Protein Prospector. MSMS spectra were manually evaluated for the presence of ions that supported the crosslinks. The crosslink between Lys544 in VLEMTGNIDEAEWEWK544AGFHR and Glu542 in VLEMTGNIDEAEWE542WK satisfied our criteria including that of spatial proximity. Distances between Lys544 and Glu542 were 7.4 and 9.5 Å, calculated from the cryo-EM (electron microscopy) structure of the HuBChE tetramer. Paraoxon ethyl, diazoxon, and dichlorvos had less pronounced effects as visualized on SDS gels. Our proof-of-principle study provides evidence that OP have the ability to crosslink proteins. If OP-induced protein crosslinking occurs in the brain, OP exposure could be responsible for some cases of neurodegenerative disease. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={A high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was developed for rapid and easy-to-perform discrimination between five goldenrod species present in Europe: the native Solidago virgaurea and the four invasive aliens, S. canadensis, S. gigantea, S. rugosa and S. graminifolia. The chemotaxonomic distinction was based on the chemical profile of their root extracts, confirmed by principal component analysis. This allowed the distinction of the goldenrods in wintertime, when classical morphological methods are not applicable. Their enzyme inhibitory profiles were determined by HPTLC combined with α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-amylase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) assays. Two compounds of S. canadensis showed the most intense enzyme inhibition in all assays, having also antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Xanthomonas euvesicatoria and Aliivibrio fischeri strains. HPTLC-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), bioassay-guided isolation, NMR spectroscopy and literature data led to the characterization and identification of the labdane diterpenes solidagenone and presolidagenone as the active S. canadensis root components. The previously identified polyacetylenes (2Z,8Z and 2E,8Z matricaria esters) of S. virgaurea, also inhibited all enzymes. Except for the known anti-AChE effect of the 2Z,8Z-matricaria ester, this is the first report on the α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-amylase, AChE and BChE inhibitory activity of these potent compounds. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the S. canadensis labdanoids were also observed for the first time. Combined with effect-directed assays and HRMS, hyphenated HPTLC allowed an effect-directed high-throughput screening and a fast characterization of multipotent compounds. The investigation of botanicals by fast, hyphenated, bioanalytical tools substantially increased the information gain with regard to active principles (bioprofiling) and efficiently pointed to potent candidates for drug development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The inhibitory activities of AChE and BChE were evaluated in vitro by Ellman method. The results show that some compounds have good inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE. Among them, compound 8i showed the strongest inhibitory effect on both AChE (eeAChE IC50 = 0.39 μM) and BChE (eqBChE IC50 = 0.28 μM). Enzyme inhibition kinetics and molecular modeling studies have shown that compound 8i bind simultaneously to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and the catalytic sites (CAS) of AChE and BChE. In addition, the cytotoxicity of compound 8i is lower than that of Tacrine, indicating its potential safety as anti-Alzheimer’s disease (anti-AD) agents.

abstract={Objectives Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after elective cardiac surgery. Recent evidence indicates that a disruption in the normal activity of the cholinergic system may be associated with delirium. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Single-centre at a European academic hospital. Primary and secondary outcome measures In our study the enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were determined preoperatively as well as on the first and second postoperative day. The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit was used to screen patients for the presence of POD. Results A total of 114 patients were included in the study. POD was associated with a decrease in BChE activity on postoperative day 1 (p=0.03). In addition, patients who developed POD, had significantly lower preoperative AChE activity than patients without POD (p<0.01). Multivariate analysis identified a preoperatively decreased AChE activity (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.14 to 8.46), anticholinergic treatment (OR 5.09; 95% CI 1.51 to 17.23), elevated European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (OR 3.68; 95% CI 1.04 to 12.99) and age (OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.06 to 8.62) to be independently associated with the development of POD. Conclusions We conclude that a reduction in the acetylcholine hydrolysing enzyme activity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery may correlate with the development of POD. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The result revealed that untreated 5-FLU rats had increased enzyme activities, which was reduced in the normal rats treated TE compared to NC. Interestingly, the TE-pretreated rats administered with 5-FLU had reduced enzyme activities compared with untreated 5-FLU rats. The antioxidant status was also normalized in the 5-FLU administered rats pretreated with TE Thus, the neuroprotective mechanisms of TE could be linked to attenuation of neuroactive enzymes and antioxidant status. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Butyrylcholinesterase is a serine hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of esters in the body. Unlike its sister enzyme acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase has a broad substrate scope and lower acetylcholine catalytic efficiency. The difference in tissue distribution and inhibitor sensitivity also points to its involvement external to cholinergic neurotransmission. Initial studies on butyrylcholinesterase showed that the inhibition of the enzyme led to the increment of brain acetylcholine levels. Further gene knockout studies suggested its involvement in the regulation of amyloid-beta, a brain pathogenic protein. Thus, it is an interesting target for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. The substrate scope of butyrylcholinesterase was recently found to include cocaine, as well as ghrelin, the “hunger hormone”. These findings led to the development of recombinant butyrylcholinesterase mutants and viral gene therapy to combat cocaine addiction, along with in-depth studies on the significance of butyrylcholinesterase in obesity. It is observed that the pharmacological impact of butyrylcholinesterase increased in tandem with each reported finding. Not only is the enzyme now considered an important pharmacological target, it is also becoming an important tool to study the biological pathways in various diseases. Here, we review and summarize the biochemical properties of butyrylcholinesterase and its roles, as a cholinergic neurotransmitter, in various diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Human butyrylcholinesterase (E.C. 3.1.1.8) purified from blood plasma has previously been shown to provide protection against up to five and a half times the median lethal dose of an organophosphorus nerve agent in several animal models. In this study the stoichiometric nature of the protection afforded by human butyrylcholinesterase against organophosphorus nerve agents was investigated in guinea pigs. Animals were administered human butyrylcholinesterase (26.15 mg/kg ≡ 308 nmol/kg) by the intravascular or intramuscular route. Animals were subsequently dosed with either soman or VX in accordance with a stage-wise adaptive dose design to estimate the modified median lethal dose in treated animals. Human butyrylcholinesterase (308 nmol/kg) increased the median lethal dose of soman from 154 nmol/kg to 770 nmol/kg. Comparing the molar ratio of agent molecules to enzyme active sites yielded a stoichiometric protective ratio of 2:1 for soman, likely related to the similar stereoselectivity the enzyme has compared to the toxic target, acetylcholinesterase. In contrast, human butyrylcholinesterase (308 nmol/kg) increased the median lethal dose of VX from 30 nmol/kg to 312 nmol/kg, resulting in a stoichiometric protective ratio of only 1:1, suggesting a lack of stereoselectivity for this agent. © 2019},

abstract={The series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical isoquinolinium-5-carbaldoximes was designed and prepared for cholinesterase reactivation purposes. The novel compounds were evaluated for intrinsic acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition, when the majority of novel compounds resulted with high inhibition of both enzymes and only weak inhibitors were selected for reactivation experiments on human AChE or BChE inhibited by sarin, VX, or paraoxon. The AChE reactivation for all used organophosphates was found negligible if compared to the reactivation ability of obidoxime. Importantly, two compounds were found to reactivate BChE inhibited by sarin or VX better to obidoxime at human attainable concentration. One compound resulted as better reactivator of NEMP (VX surrogate)-inhibited BChE than obidoxime. The in vitro results were further rationalized by molecular docking studies showing future directions on designing potent BChE reactivators. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Organophosphate nerve agents rapidly inhibit cholinesterases thereby destroying the ability to sustain life. Strong nucleophiles, such as oximes, have been used as therapeutic reactivators of cholinesterase-organophosphate complexes, but suffer from short half-lives and limited efficacy across the broad spectrum of organophosphate nerve agents. Cholinesterases have been used as long-lived therapeutic bioscavengers for unreacted organophosphates with limited success because they react with organophosphate nerve agents with one-to-one stoichiometries. The chemical power of nucleophilic reactivators is coupled to long-lived bioscavengers by designing and synthesizing cholinesterase-polymer-oxime conjugates using atom transfer radical polymerization and azide-alkyne “click” chemistry. Detailed kinetic studies show that butyrylcholinesterase-polymer-oxime activity is dependent on the electrostatic properties of the polymers and the amount of oxime within the conjugate. The covalent coupling of oxime-containing polymers to the surface of butyrylcholinesterase slows the rate of inactivation of paraoxon, a model nerve agent. Furthermore, when the enzyme is covalently inhibited by paraoxon, the covalently attached oxime induced inter- and intramolecular reactivation. Intramolecular reactivation will open the door to the generation of a new class of nerve agent scavengers that couple the speed and selectivity of biology to the ruggedness and simplicity of synthetic chemicals. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Development of acetyl-(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors belongs to viable strategies for the treatment of dementia and other diseases related to decrease in cholinergic neurotransmission. Objective: That is why we designed twenty-two analogues of a dual AChE-BuChE salicylanilide inhibitor, N-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzamide 1, to improve its potency. Methods: We prepared N,N-disubstituted (thio)carbamates via direct acylation with (thio)carbamoyl chloride, N-n-alkyl monosubstituted carbamates using isocyanates as well as its salicylanilide core analogues. The derivatives were evaluated in vitro against AChE from electric eel and BuChE from equine serum using spectrophotometric Ellman’s method. Results: The compounds showed moderate inhibition of both AChE and BuChE with IC50 from 18.2 to 196.6 µmol.L-1 and 9.2 to 196.2 µmol.L-1, respectively. Importantly, based on the substitution pattern, it is possible to modulate selectivity against AChE or BuChE and some derivatives also produced a balanced inhibition. In general, the most promising analogues were N-alkyl (C2-C6 ) carbamates and isomers with a changed position of phenolic hydroxyl. N-[3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-bromo-5-hydroxybenzamide 4a was the best inhibitor of both cholinesterases. Conclusion: A wide range of the derivatives improved the activity of the hit 1, they were superior to carbamate drug rivastigmine against AChE and some of them also against BuChE. The most promising derivatives also fit physicochemical space and structural features for CNS drugs together with an escalated lipophilicity. © 2020, Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Two cholinesterases exist: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). While AChE plays a crucial role in neurotransmissions, BChE has no specific function apart from the detoxification of some drugs and secondary metabolites from plants. Thus, both AChE and BChE can serve as biochemical markers of various pathologies. Poisoning by nerve agents like sarin, soman, tabun, VX, novichok and overdosing by drugs used in some neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer´s disease and myasthenia gravis, as well as poisoning by organophosphorus pesticides are relevant to this issue. But it appears that changes in these enzymes take place in other processes including oxidative stress, inflammation, some types of cancer and genetically conditioned diseases. In this review, the cholinesterases are introduced, the mechanism of inhibitors action is explained and the relations between the cholinesterases and pathologies are explained. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurological disorder, is the most common cause of senile dementia. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzyme plays a vital role in regulating the brain ace-tylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter, but in the case of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), BuChE activity gradu-ally increases in patients with a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACh) concentration via hydrolysis. ACh plays an essential role in regulating learning and memory as the cortex originates from the basal fore-brain, and thus, is involved in memory consolidation in these sites. Methods: In this work, we have developed a partial least squares (PLS)-regression based two dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) model using 1130 diverse chemical classes of compounds with defined activity against the BuChE enzyme. Keeping in mind the strict Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, we have tried to select significant descriptors from the large initial pool of descriptors using multi-layered variable selection strategy using stepwise regression followed by genetic algorithm (GA) followed by again stepwise regression technique and at the end best subset selection prior to development of final model thus reducing noise in the input. Partial least squares (PLS) regression technique was employed for the development of the final model while model validation was performed using various stringent validation criteria. Results: The results obtained from the QSAR model suggested that the quality of the model is accept-able in terms of both internal (R2= 0.664, Q2= 0.650) and external (R2Pred= 0.657) validation parameters. The QSAR studies were analyzed, and the structural features (hydrophobic, ring aromatic and hydrogen bond acceptor/donor) responsible for enhancement of the activity were identified. The developed model further suggests that the presence of hydrophobic features like long carbon chain would increase the BuChE inhibitory activity and presence of amino group and hydrazine fragment promoting the hydrogen bond interactions would be important for increasing the inhibitory activity against BuChE enzyme. Conclusion: Furthermore, molecular docking studies have been carried out to understand the molecular interactions between the ligand and receptor, and the results are then correlated with the structural features obtained from the QSAR models. The information obtained from the QSAR models are well cor-roborated with the results of the docking study. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Brain butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an attractive target for drugs designed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in its advanced stages. It also potentially represents a biomarker for progression of this disease. Based on the crystal structure of previously described highly potent, reversible, and selective BChE inhibitors, we have developed the fluorescent probes that are selective towards human BChE. The most promising probes also maintain their inhibition of BChE in the low nanomolar range with high selectivity over acetylcholinesterase. Kinetic studies of probes reveal a reversible mixed inhibition mechanism, with binding of these fluorescent probes to both the free and acylated enzyme. Probes show environment-sensitive emission, and additionally, one of them also shows significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity upon binding to the active site of BChE. Finally, the crystal structures of probes in complex with human BChE are reported, which offer an excellent base for further development of this library of compounds. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Organophosphates (OPs) induce acute and chronic neurotoxicity, primarily by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as well as by necrosis, and apoptosis. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), an exogenous bioscavenger of OPs, can be used as a treatment for OP exposure. It is prerequisite to develop in vitro brain models that can study BuChE post-treatment for acute OP exposure. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) brain-on-chip platform with human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes to simulate human brain behavior. The platform consists of two compartments: 1) a hydrogel embedded with human iPSC-derived GABAergic neurons and astrocytes and 2) a perfusion channel with dynamic medium flow. The brain tissue constructs were exposed to Malathion (MT) at various concentrations and then treated with BuChE after 20 minutes of MT exposure. Results show that the iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes directly interacted and formed synapses in the 3D matrix, and that treatment with BuChE improved viability after MT exposure up to a concentration of 10-3 M. We conclude that the 3D brain-on-chip platform with human iPSC-derived brain cells is a suitable model to study the neurotoxicity of OP exposure and evaluate therapeutic compounds for treatment. © 2020 Liu et al.

abstract={Background: Hydrazide-hydrazones have been known as scaffold with various biological activities including inhibition of acetyl-(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Cholinesterase inhibitors are mainstays of dementias’ treatment. Objective: Twenty-five iodinated hydrazide-hydrazones and their analogues were designed as potential central AChE and BuChE inhibitors. Methods: Hydrazide-hydrazones were synthesized from 4-substituted benzohydrazides and 2-/4-hydroxy-3,5-diiodobenzaldehydes. The compounds were investigated in vitro for their potency to inhibit AChE from electric eel and BuChE from equine serum using Ellman’s method. We calculated also physicochemical and structural parameters for CNS delivery. Results: The derivatives exhibited a moderate dual inhibition with IC50 values ranging from 15.1-140.5 and 35.5 to 170.5 µmol.L-1 for AChE and BuChE, respectively. Generally, the compounds produced a balanced or more potent inhibition of AChE. N'-[(E)-(4-Hydroxy-3,5-diiodophenyl)methylidene]-4-nitrobenzohydrazide 2k and 4-fluoro-N'-(2-hydroxy-3,5-diiodobenzyl)benzohydrazide 3a were the most potent inhibitors of AChE and BuChE, respectively. Structure-activity relationships were established, and molecular docking studies confirmed interaction with enzymes. Conclusion: Many novel hydrazide-hydrazones showed lower IC50 values than rivastigmine against AChE and some of them were comparable for BuChE to this drug used for the treatment of dementia. They interact with cholinesterases via non-covalent binding into the active site. Based on the BOILED-Egg approach, the majority of the derivatives met the criteria for blood-brain-barrier permeability. © 2020, Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={The dual inhibition of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) plays an important role in Alzheimer’s disease treatment. Thus, this study aims identify promising dual inhibitors against hAChE and hBuChE by in silico approaches (pharmacophore-based virtual screening and molecular docking). Ten 3D pharmacophore models for dual inhibitors using default genetic parameters were built by GALAHAD™ available on SYBYL-X 2.0. Validation steps were carried out according to Energy (<100.0 kcal/mol), Pareto = 0, Area under the ROC Curve (>0.70), Boltzmann-Enhanced Discrimination of ROC curve (BEDROC >0.50) and structure–activity relationship (SAR) for known inhibitors. The best dual pharmacophore model based on internal/external statistical parameters and SAR data (one hydrogen bond acceptor, two hydrogen bond donors and four hydrophobic centers) was employed in virtual screening at Sigma-Aldrich® subset (n = 214,446) of ZINC database by UNITY module of SYBYL-X 2.0. According to superposition values (QFIT), the best ranked compounds were prioritized for molecular docking and partition coefficient analysis (clog p < 5.0). 37 top-ranked compounds (QFIT > 64.22) from pharmacophore model showed affinity in hAChE (-10.2 < Affinity energy < −6.3 kcal/mol) and hBuChE (-10.9 < Affinity energy < −2.3 kcal/mol) binding sites. Next, liposolubity prediction and commercially available showed that ZINC43198636, ZINC43198637 and ZINC00390718 can be potential dual inhibitors against hAChE and hBuChE.

abstract={Pleurotus ostreatus (P. ostreatus) and Lentinus subnudus (L. subnudus) have been used by the locals for the management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but with scant scientific sources. The aim of this study is to assess the neuroprotective properties of P. ostreatus and L. subnudus using transgenic Drosophila melanogaster flies (TDMF). The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), as well as the antioxidant status of TDMF raised on a diet supplemented with P. ostreatus and L. subnudus were determined. The flies were raised on a diet devoid of supplements or supplemented with P. ostreatus or L. subnudus (1% and 5% inclusion) for 7 days. Afterward, AChE and BChE activities, as well as catalase and total thiol level, were determined. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also determined in the flies raised on a diet devoid of supplement and on supplemented diets. Meanwhile, flies raised on P. ostreatus– and L. subnudus–supplemented diets exhibited a significant reduction in the activity of AChE and BChE in comparison with the controls. Also, supplemented diets significantly (p < 0.05) enhance catalase activity and improve total thiol level, while ROS and MDA levels were observed to be reduced in all the flies raised on the supplemented diets in comparison with the controls. In summary, reduction in the activity of AChE and BChE, as well as improved antioxidant status in TDMF, could be some of the mechanisms through which P. ostreatus and L. subnudus exhibit anti-AD properties. Nevertheless, L. subnudus exhibits a better neuroprotective effect than P. ostreatus. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) serves as a bio scavenger to counteract organophosphate poisoning. It is also a potential drug candidate in several therapeutic fields. Therefore, in the present study, we constructed a new dual-promoter plasmid consisting of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) promoters and transfected that into HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine to enhance the BChE secretion. Methods: The new dual-promoter construction (pBudCE dual BChE) including two copies of the BChE gene was designed and transfected into cells by liposomal structures. The cloned plasmids were evaluated by enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis analysis. Experimental groups were categorized into the cells transfected by pBudCE dual BChE (treatment), pCMV (positive control) vectors, and nontransfected cells (negative control). BChE gene expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR and the enzyme activity was assessed using modified Ellman’s method. The freeze-thaw process was carried out for analyzing the stability of the pBudCE dual BChE vector. Results: Validation examination of the cloned plasmids confirmed the successful cloning process. The gene expression level and Ellman’s method value in pBudCE dual BChE was higher than the other groups. CMV promoter has also increased the enzyme activity, although the difference was not significant compared with the control group. Interestingly, freeze-thaw cycles followed by several passages did not affect the enzyme activity. Conclusion: The designed construction with CMV and EF-1α promoters could increase BChE gene expression and the activity of the BChE enzyme in HEK-293 cell line. Largescale production of BChE enzyme can be achieved by using dual-promoter plasmid construction compared to a single-promoter vector to be used in clinical trials. © 2020 Mirzaie et al.},

abstract={Background: An epistatic interaction between the ϵ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE ϵ4) gene and the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) genes has been previously reported to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these observations were largely from case-control studies with small sample sizes. Objective: To examine the interaction between APOE ϵ4 and BCHE-K on: 1) the risk of incident AD and 2) rates of change in brain volumes and cognitive performance during the preclinical stages of AD in a prospective cohort study. Methods: The study sample for survival analysis included 691 Caucasian participants (age at baseline, 58.4±9.9 years; follow-up time,16.9±9.7 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The neuroimaging sample included 302 participants with 1,388 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Cognitive performance was assessed in 703 participants over 4,908 visits. Results: A total of 122 diagnoses (79 AD, 43 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) were identified. Participants with both APOE ϵ4 and BCHE-K variants had a 3.7-fold greater risk of AD (Hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI=1.99-6.89, p<0.001) compared to non-carriers of both genes (APOE ϵ4 x BCHE-K interaction p=0.025). There was no APOE ϵ4-BCHE-K interaction effect on rate of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Conclusion: The APOE and BCHE genes interact to influence risk of incident AD/MCI but not rates of brain atrophy and decline in cognitive performance before onset of cognitive impairment. This may suggest the epistatic interaction between APOE ϵ4 and BCHE-K on AD risk is disease stage-dependent. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background and purpose: Diazinon is an organophosphate insecticide that binds to the acetylcholinesterase enzyme after metabolization causing its inactivation. Galic acid is a polyphenolic compound with nucleophilic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gallic acid on reactivation of acetylcholine and butyrylcholinesterase inhibited by diazinon in mice and human serum and erythrocytes. Materials and methods: The animals were divided into seven groups, including a control group that received corn oil as a solvent and other groups that received diazinon (80 mg/kg), atropine (20 mg/kg), and pralidoxime (20 mg/kg). Gallic acid was injected intraperitoneally at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Cholinesterase levels (acetylcholine and butyrylcholinesterase) were evaluated after 3 and 24 h of intoxication in mice serum and erythrocytes. In addition, in vitro studies were done in human serum and RBCs. Results: Activities of cholinesterase in serum and erythrocytes significantly decreased after 3 and 24 hours of poisoning in diazinon-treated group compared to control group in vivo and in vitro. Co-treatment with atropine and gallic acid (at all doses) significantly increased cholinesterase activity compared to the diazinon group in vitro and in vivo (P< 0.0001). Conclusion: Combination therapy with gallic acid (at different doses) and atropine reduced inhibition of cholinesterase activity caused by diazinon and improved its reactivation. Gallic acid reactivates cholinesterase activity which might be due to hydroxyl groups in its compounds. © 2020, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study aimed to identify and quantify the chemical composition and polyphenolic profile of 19 cultivars of Chaenomeles × superba, Chaenomeles japonica, and Chaenomeles speciosa by liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector and quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-PDA-QTOF-ESI-MS). Antioxidant (ABTS on-line, ABTS, FRAP, and ORAC), as well as in vitro biological activities, i.e., the ability to inhibit α-amylase, α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) were determined. Most of the Chaenomeles species and cultivars analyzed in this study have not been examined in this respect until now. Fruits contained 30.26 to 195.05 mg of vitamin C, 0.65 to 1.69 g of pectin, 0.32 to 0.64 g of ash, 0.60 to 3.98 g of sugars, and 41.64 to 110.31 g of organic acids in 100 g fresh weight. The lowest content of total polyphenols showed C. speciosa ‘Rubra’ (57.84 g/kg dry weight, dw) while C. × superba ’Nicoline’ (170.38 g/kg dw) exhibited the highest concentration of those compounds. In the phenolic compounds, polymeric procyanidin fraction predominated (65%) with procyanidin B2, C1, and (−)-epicatechin the most abundant. The antioxidant capacity measured by ABTS assay was mainly formed by polymeric procyanidins and flavan-3-ols, which was confirmed by ABTS on-line profiling. Chaenomeles fruits showed high potential for inhibition of α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase. The analyzed cultivars displayed greater potential for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition than for butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The data indicate that Chaenomeles fruits could be regarded as a promising source of bioactive functional food. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Furthermore, the compounds were subjected to molecular docking dynamics simulations to ascertain their potentials as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Molecular docking simulations showed varied binding activities towards the two binding sites of acetylcholinesterase: 4EY7 and 1OCD, and human butyrylcholinesterase: 1P0I.

abstract={Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of echothiophate, a P–S bonded organophosphorus (OP) model, was spectrofluorimetrically monitored, using Calbiochem Probe IV as the thiol reagent. OP hydrolases were: the G117H mutant of human butyrylcholinesterase capable of hydrolyzing OPs, and a multiple mutant of Brevundimonas diminuta phosphotriesterase, GG1, designed to hydrolyze a large spectrum of OPs at high rate, including V agents. Molecular modeling of interaction between Probe IV and OP hydrolases (G117H butyrylcholinesterase, GG1, wild types of Brevundimonas diminuta and Sulfolobus solfataricus phosphotriesterases, and human paraoxonase-1) was performed. The high sensitivity of the method allowed steady-state kinetic analysis of echothiophate hydrolysis by highly purified G117H butyrylcholinesterase concentration as low as 0.85 nM. Hydrolysis was michaelian with Km = 0.20 ± 0.03 mM and kcat = 5.4 ± 1.6 min−1. The GG1 phosphotriesterase hydrolyzed echothiophate with a high efficiency (Km = 2.6 ± 0.2 mM; kcat = 53,400 min−1). With a kcat/Km = (2.6 ± 1.6) × 107 M−1min−1, GG1 fulfills the required condition of potential catalytic bioscavengers. quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular docking indicate that Probe IV does not interact significantly with the selected phosphotriesterases. Moreover, results on G117H mutant show that Probe IV does not inhibit butyrylcholinesterase. Therefore, Probe IV can be recommended for monitoring hydrolysis of P–S bonded OPs by thiol-free OP hydrolases. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) acts as a promising protein targets for which drug as an inhibitor can be designed to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. Different flavonoids and alkaloids of Bauhinia variegata were used as an inhibitor to target the protein. The current in silico study was carried out to explore the binding patterns of flavanoids and alkaloids against Acetylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 4PQE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 1P0I) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations approach. Molecular docking result shows that Dihydroquercetin (CID:439533) binds with the active region of AChE and BChE. Using molsoft, molinspiration, and pkCSM all the properties of the candidate were analyzed. The best compound Dihydroquercetin was compared with Donepezil drug through molecular dynamic simulation studies. The analysis of Molecular Dynamics Simulations showed that AChE and AChE-Dihydroquercetin complex became stable at 3000 ps and there was little conformational change in BChE and BChE-Dihydroquercetin complex. The in silico study finally predicts that Dihydroquercetin may act as a good inhibitor for treating Alzheimer’s disease and further in vitro and in vivo studies may prove its therapeutic potential.

abstract={Inhibition of cholinesterases remains one of a few available treatment strategies for neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease and related conditions. The current study was inspired by previous data on anticholinesterase properties of diterpenoids from Perovskia atriplicifolia and other Lamiaceae species. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition by the three new natural compounds—(1R,15R)-1-acetoxycryptotanshinone (1), (1R)-1-acetoxytanshinone IIA (2), and (15R)-1-oxoaegyptinone A (3)— as well as, new for this genus, isograndifoliol (4) were assessed. Three of these compounds exhibited profound inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and much weaker inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). All compounds (1–4) selectively inhibited BChE (IC50 = 2.4, 7.9, 50.8, and 0.9 µM, respectively), whereas only compounds 3 and 4 moderately inhibited AChE (IC50 329.8 µM and 342.9 µM). Molecular docking and in silico toxicology prediction studies were also performed on the active compounds. Natural oxygenated norditerpenoids from the traditional Central Asian medicinal plant P. atriplicifolia are selective BChE inhibitors. Their high potential makes them useful candidate molecules for further investigation as lead compounds in the development of a natural drug against dementia caused by neurodegenerative diseases. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={A new spectrofluorimetric method more sensitive than the Ellman method was developed for determination of both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity and for kinetic analysis of these enzymes and their mutants. Two selected mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase (E197Q and E197G) were included in this work. As for the Ellman's method, substrates are thiocholine esters, but the chromogenic reagent, DTNB (dithio-bisnitro benzoic acid) is replaced by a fluorogenic probe, “Calbiochem Probe IV”, (3-(7-Hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-ylcarbamoyl)acrylic acid methylester). Compared to the classical Ellman's method, the sensitivity of this new spectrofluorimetric assay is 2 orders of magnitude higher. The method allows measurement of activity in media containing &lt;10−11 M of cholinesterase active sites at low substrate concentrations, either under first order conditions, [S] &lt;&lt; Km, or under conditions where kinetics obeys the Michaelis-Menten model, i.e. at [S] &lt; 1 mM for wild-type enzymes. The method adapted to titration plate reader assays is suitable for clinical and toxicological routine analyses, for high throughput screening of novel cholinesterase mutants and screening of inhibitor libraries of pharmacological interest. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is tacitly assumed that the biological role of acetylcholinesterase is termination of synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses. However, together with its structural homolog, butyrylcholinesterase, it is widely distributed both within and outside the nervous system, and, in many cases, the role of both enzymes remains obscure. The transient appearance of the cholinesterases in embryonic tissues is especially enigmatic. The two enzymes’ extra-synaptic roles, which are known as ‘non-classical’ roles, are the topic of this review. Strong evidence has been presented that AChE and BChE play morphogenetic roles in a variety of eukaryotic systems, and they do so either by acting as adhesion proteins, or as trophic factors. As trophic factors, one mode of action is to directly regulate morphogenesis, such as neurite outgrowth, by poorly understood mechanisms. The other mode is by regulating levels of acetylcholine, which acts as the direct trophic factor. Alternate substrates have been sought for the cholinesterases. Quite recently, it was shown that levels of the aggression hormone, ghrelin, which also controls appetite, are regulated by butyrylcholinesterase. The rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase generates high local proton concentrations. The possible biophysical and biological consequences of this effect are discussed. The biological significance of the acetylcholinesterases secreted by parasitic nematodes is reviewed, and, finally, the involvement of acetylcholinesterase in apoptosis is considered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Glycyrrhiza glabra L. is an important medicinal plant endowed with various pharmacological virtues. This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticholinesterase activities of the Algerian Glycyrrhiza glabra L. roots extracts. Methods: The chemical composition of both chloroformic (LCh) and ethyl acetate (LAE) extracts were analyzed by RP-HPLC-PDA and1H NMR spectroscopy. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using hydrogen atoms transfer methods (DPPH) and single electron transfer (ABTS and CUPRAC assays). The antibacterial activity was realized against different strains via the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), when the anticholinesterase activity was performed through the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes inhibition. Results: The chemical analysis revealed the presence of phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-coumaric acid) and a hydroxycinnamic compound (ferulic acid). However, flavonoids were represented by quercetin, rutin (flavonol), and glabridin (isoflavane). The1H NMR of the L4 fraction from LCh extract allowed to characterize the structure of glabridin. The antioxidant assays revealed that LCh extract is the best among other extracts with IC50 DPPH of 33.94 µg/mL, IC50 ABTS of 3.45 µg/mL and CUPRAC A0.5 of 21.78 µg/mL. The LCh extract displayed an effective antibacterial activity with MIC’s of 19.5 µg/mL against seven gram positive and negative bacteria strains. The same extract showed a potent butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity with IC50= 4.72 ± 0.72 µg/mL, which is too strong than the standard drug. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that G. glabra root extracts had a high antibacterial, and free radical scavenging. It was also able to inhibit cholinesterase enzymes, which confirm the effectiveness of phytoconstituents present in the plant, especially flavonoids. © 2020, Bentham Science Publishers.

abstract={In the first stage of the manuscript, we aimed to examine antioxidant capacity and anticholinergic properties of avocado (Folium perseae) leaves. Avocado leaf was extracted by water (WEFP) and ethyl alcohol (EEFP) and antioxidant activity was determined using by several antioxidant assays including DPPH· and ABTS•+ radical scavenging assays, Cu2+-Cu+ reducing, Fe3+-Fe2+ reducing, and FRAP reducing activities. Avocado leaf extracts demonstrated antioxidant activity and anticholinergic activities, while α-tocopherol, BHT, trolox, and BHA were used as positive antioxidant controls. In the second part of this study, the inhibition effects of WEFP and EEFP were valuated against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes, which catalyze the breakdown of choline esters (i.e. neurotransmitters). This study obviously showed that avocado leaf extracts had effective antioxidant, antiradical, and anticholinergic influences. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The designed edaravone-N-benzyl pyridinium hybrid compounds were docked within the AChE active site. The results indicated interactions with conserved amino acids (Trp279 in PAS and Trp84 in CAS), suggesting good dual-site inhibitory activity. Significant in vitro AChE inhibitory activities were observed for selected compounds (IC50: 1.2–4.6 µM) with limited butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (IC50’s &gt;160 µM), indicating excellent selectivity towards AChE (SI: 46–&gt;278).

abstract={Acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated vagal transmission as well as nonneuronal ACh release are considered cardioprotective in pathological situations with increased sympathetic drive such as ischemia–reperfusion and cardiac remodeling. ACh action is terminated by hydrolysis by the cholinesterases (ChEs), acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase. Both ChEs exist in multiple molecular variants either soluble or anchored by specific anchoring proteins like collagen Q (ColQ) anchoring protein and proline-rich membrane anchoring protein (PRiMA). Here we assessed the expression of specific ChE molecular forms in different heart compartments using RT-qPCR. We show that both ChEs are expressed in all heart compartments but display different expression patterns. The acetylcholinesterase-T variant together with PRiMA and ColQ is predominantly expressed in rat atria. Butylcholinesterase is found in all heart compartments and is accompanied by both PRiMA and ColQ anchors. Its expression in the ventricular system suggests involvement in the nonneuronal cholinergic system. Additionally, two PRiMA variants are detected throughout the rat heart. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mangosteen is one of the best tasting tropical fruit widely cultivated in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to quantify xanthone content in different parts of Garcinia mangostana by LC-QTOF-MS and determine its influence on their cholinesterase inhibitory activities. The total xanthone content in G. mangostana was in the following order: pericarp &gt; calyx &gt; bark &gt; stalk &gt; stem &gt; leaves &gt; aril. The total xanthone content of pericarp was 100 times higher than the aril. Methanol extracts of the pericarp and calyx demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with IC50 values of 0.90 and 0.37 µg/mL, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between xanthone content and cholinesterase inhibition. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed α-mangostin and γ-mangostin of pericarp as the key metabolites contributing to cholinesterase inhibition. Due to the increasing demand of mangosteen products, repurposing of fruit waste (pericarp) has great potential for enhancement of the cognitive health of human beings. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={There are numerous studies supporting the contribution of oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Prolonged oxidative stress is associated with the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters, which results in antiepileptic drugs resistance. During our studies, three 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione derivatives were evaluated for the antioxidant activity and anticonvulsant effect in the 6 Hz model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The investigated compounds exhibited 2-3 times more potent anticonvulsant activity than valproic acid in 6 Hz test in mice, which is well-established preclinical model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The antioxidant/ROS scavenging activity was confirmed in both single-electron transfer-based methods (DPPH and CUPRAC) and during flow cytometric analysis of total ROS activity in U-87 MG cells. Based on the enzymatic studies on human carbonic anhydrases (CAs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), one can assume that the herein investigated drug candidates will not impair the cognitive processes mediated by CAs and will have minimal off-target cholinergic effects. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Keeping in view the public health-related issues of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), its unpredictable occurrence and progression indicate the needs for best treatment options. The present bioinformatics study explores the binding pattern and molecular interactions between human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymes with natural compounds from Bacopa monnieri. The docking analysis between natural compounds as a ligand and AChE, BuChE as a receptor was completed using MGL tools Autodock 4.2 module. The analysis of the hydrophobic interactions, inhibition constants, and hydrogen bonds may indicates that they play a significant role in finding out the interacting position at the active site. However, after analyzing the binding energy (δG), the documented data shows that bacoside X, bacoside A, 3-beta-D-glucosylstigmasterol and daucosterol could be good inhibitors in the inhibition of AChE and BuChE activities. Therefore, our study indicates that the inhibition constants of the aforesaid natural compounds of Bacopa can be utilized for the development of inhibitors. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

We present the design, synthesis, and biochemical evaluation of these two series of novel 1,3-chalcone-donepezil (15a-15f) or 1,4-chalcone-donepezil (16a-16f) hybrids. We evaluate the relationship between their structures and their ability to inhibit AChE/BChE activity as well as their ability to bind Aβ peptides. We show that several of these novel chalcone-donepezil hybrids can successfully inhibit AChE/BChE as well as the assembly of N-biotinylated Aβ(1-42) oligomers. We also demonstrate that the Aβ binding site of these hybrids differs from that of Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB). © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Cholinesterase inhibitor plays an important role in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Herein, we report the medicinal chemistry efforts leading to a new series of 1,3-dimethylbenzimidazolinone derivatives. Among the synthesised compounds, 15b and 15j showed submicromolar IC50 values (15b, eeAChE IC50 = 0.39 ± 0.11 µM; 15j, eqBChE IC50 = 0.16 ± 0.04 µM) towards acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Kinetic and molecular modelling studies revealed that 15b and 15j act in a competitive manner. 15b and 15j showed neuroprotective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage on PC12 cells. This effect was further supported by their antioxidant activity determined in a DPPH assay in vitro. Morris water maze test confirmed the memory amelioration effect of the two compounds in a scopolamine-induced mouse model. Moreover, the hepatotoxicity of 15b and 15j was lower than tacrine.

abstract={Risk stratification is of utmost importance in burn therapy. However, suitable bedside biomarkers to evaluate the emerging inflammatory response following burn injuries are missing. Serum cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase, BChE) has been shown to be a clinically relevant biomarker in acute inflammatory diseases including burns. In this observational cohort study BChE activity was measured by using point-of-care testing (POCT), a novel method in acute burn care. POCT measurements were performed at emergency room admission (ERA) of 35 patients and repeated 12, 24 and 48 h later. All patients or their legal designees gave informed consent. Patients with burn injuries showed sustained BChE activity reduction following hospital admission. BChE activity correlated negatively with burn injury severity, organ failure severity and intensive care unit resource requirements. BChE activity measured at ERA and 12 h later identified survivors and predicted 28-day patient outcome with noninferior efficacy compared to the abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI) scoring. Finally, POCT-measured BChE activity might complement ABSI scoring and possibly improve early risk stratification in acute burn care therapy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI},

abstract={Currently, nerve agents are often used in terrorist attacks or assassinations. In such cases, it is necessary to detect them quickly, accurately and easily right in the field. Detection tubes, which are small devices containing pellets with immobilized cholinesterase and detection reagents, meet these conditions. Their detection mechanism is based on a highly sensitive enzymatic Ellman reaction, when in the absence of cholinesterase inhibitors the pellets develop a visible yellow color, whereas in their presence the carriers retain the original color. The rate of reaction, its sensitivity and the distinct color transition are the key points of the research. In this experiment, double-coated pellets were prepared. The first coating contained the butyrylcholinesterase immobilized in hypromellose, while the second coating consisted of ethylcellulose and triethyl citrate. Based on the properties of such carriers, samples containing lactose dispersed in the ethylcellulose coating were also prepared, which was expected to have an effect on increasing the permeability of the coating and hence the detection rate and color intensity. In addition to selected physicochemical properties, carriers were evaluated for enzyme activity, sensitivity and color transition intensity. Samples showing the best properties were subjected to a 24-months stability test at three different temperatures and humidity. © 2020, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are primary targets in attenuating the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. Their inhibition results in elevated concentrations of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which supports communication among nerve cells. It was previously shown for trans-4/5-arylethenyloxazole compounds to have moderate AChE and BChE inhibitory properties. A preliminary docking study showed that elongating oxazole molecules and adding a new NH group could make them more prone to bind to the active site of both enzymes. Therefore, new trans-amino-4-/5-arylethenyl-oxazoles were designed and synthesised by the Buchwald-Hartwig amination of a previously synthesised trans-chloro-arylethenyloxazole derivative. Additionally, naphthoxazole benzylamine photoproducts were obtained by efficient photochemical electrocyclization reaction. Novel compounds were tested as inhibitors of both AChE and BChE. All of the compounds exhibited binding preference for BChE over AChE, especially for trans-amino-4-/5-arylethenyl-oxazole derivatives which inhibited BChE potently (IC50 in µM range) and AChE poorly (IC50≫100 µM). Therefore, due to the selectivity of all of the tested compounds for binding to BChE, these compounds could be applied for further development of cholinesterase selective inhibitors.HIGHLIGHTS Series of oxazole benzylamines were designed and synthesised The tested compounds showed binding selectivity for BChE Naphthoxazoles were more potent AChE inhibitors. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Ellman enzyme inhibition assay showed that the alkaloid-enriched leaf extract of C. papaya possessed significant anti-BChE activity with an enzyme inhibition of 75.9%. GC-MS analysis showed that the alkaloid extract composed mainly the carpaine (64.9%) – a major papaya alkaloid, and some minor constituents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenes and phenolics. Molecular docking of carpaine revealed that this molecule formed hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with choline binding site and acyl pocket.

abstract={We synthesized conjugates of tacrine with 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives linked by two different spacers, pentylaminopropene (compounds 4) and pentylaminopropane (compounds 5), as potential drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The conjugates effectively inhibited cholinesterases with a predominant effect on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). They were also effective at displacing propidium from the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), suggesting that they could block AChE-induced β-amyloid aggregation. In addition, the compounds exhibited high radical-scavenging capacity. Conjugates 5 had higher anti-BChE activity and greater anti-aggregant potential as well relatively lower potency against carboxylesterase than compounds 4. Quantum-mechanical (QM) characterization agreed with NMR data to identify the most stable forms of conjugates for docking studies, which showed that the compounds bind to both CAS and PAS of AChE consistent with mixed reversible inhibition. Conjugates 4 were more potent radical scavengers, in agreement with HOMO localization in the enamine-thiadiazole system. Computational studies showed that all of the conjugates were expected to have good intestinal absorption, whereas conjugates 4 and 5 were predicted to have medium and high blood-brain barrier permeability, respectively. All conjugates were predicted to have medium cardiac toxicity risks. Overall, the results indicated that the conjugates are promising candidates for further development and optimization as multifunctional therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells typically produce glycoproteins with N-glycans terminating in α-2,3 sialylation. Human cells produce glycoproteins that include α-2,3 and α-2,6 sialic acids. To examine the impact of altering protein sialylation on pharmacokinetic properties, recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was produced in CHO cells by knocking out the α-2,3 sialyltransferase genes followed by overexpression of the α-2,6 sialyltransferase (26BChE) enzyme. The N-glycan composition of 26BChE was compared to BChE with α-2,3 sialylation (23BChE) derived from wild-type CHO cells. Both 23BChE and 26BChE exhibited comparable antennarity distributions with bi-antennary di-sialylated glycans representing the most abundant glycoform. CD-1 mice were intravenously injected with the 23BChE or 26BChE, and residual BChE activities from blood collected at various time points for pharmacokinetic analyses. Although 23BChE contained a slightly lower initial sialylation level compared to 26BChE, the molecule exhibited higher residual activity between 5 and 24 hr postinjection. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that 23BChE exhibited an increase in area under the curve and a lower volume of distribution at steady state than that of 26BChE. These findings suggest that the type of sialylation linkage may play a significant role in the pharmacokinetic behavior of a biotherapeutic when tested in in vivo animal models. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Multi-target-directed ligands seem to be an interesting approach to the treatment of complex disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to find novel multifunctional compounds in a non-imidazole histamine H3 receptor ligand library. Docking-based virtual screening was applied for selection of twenty-six hits which were subsequently evaluated in Ellman's assay for the inhibitory potency toward acetyl- (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The virtual screening with high success ratio enabled to choose multi-target-directed ligands. Based on docking results, all selected ligands were able to bind both catalytic and peripheral sites of AChE and BuChE. The most promising derivatives combined the flavone moiety via a six carbon atom linker with a heterocyclic moiety, such as azepane, piperidine or 3-methylpiperidine. They showed the highest inhibitory activities toward cholinesterases as well as well-balanced potencies against H3R and both enzymes. Two derivatives were chosen - 5 (IC50 = 0.46 μM (AChE); 0.44 μM (BuChE); Ki = 159.8 nM (H3R)) and 17 (IC50 = 0.50 μM (AChE); 0.76 μM (BuChE); Ki = 228.2 nM (H3R)), and their inhibition mechanism was evaluated in kinetic studies. Both compounds displayed non-competitive mode of AChE and BuChE inhibition. Compounds 5 and 17 might serve as good lead structures for further optimization and development of novel multi-target anti-Alzheimer's agents. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={The identification of dual inhibitors targeting the active sites of the cholinesterase enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), have lately surfaced as a multi-approach towards Alzheimer treatment. More recently, a novel series of 4-N-phenylaminoquinolines was synthesized and evaluated against AChE and BuChE in which one of the compounds displayed appreciable inhibition compared to the standard compound, galantamine. To provide a clearer picture of the inhibition mechanism of this potent compound at the molecular level, computational biomolecular modeling was carried out. The investigation was initiated with the exploration of the chemical properties of the identified compound 11 b and reference drug, galantamine. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal some conceptual parameters that provide information on the stability and reactivity of the compounds as potential inhibitors. To unveil the binding mechanism, energetics and enzyme-ligand interactions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of six different systems were executed over a period. Calculated binding free energy values are in the same order with experimental IC50 data. Identification of the main residues driving optimum binding of the active compound 11 b to the binding region of both AChE and BuChE showed Trp81 and Trp110 as the most important, respectively. It was proposed that the studied compound could serve as a dual inhibitor for AChE and BuChE, therefore, would potentially be a promising moiety in a multi-target approach for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disorder.

abstract={Background: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are known to be serine hydrolase enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), which is a significant neurotransmitter for regulation of cognition in animals. Inhibition of cholinesterases is an effective method to curb Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive and fatal neurological disorder. Objective: In this study, 30 new hydrazone derivatives were synthesized. Then we evaluated their anticholinesterase activity of compounds. We also tried to get insights into binding interactions of the synthesized compounds in the active site of both enzymes by using molecular docking approach. Methods: The compounds were synthesized by the reaction of various substituted/nonsubstituted benzaldehydes with 6-(substitute/nonsubstituephenyl)-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propiyohydrazide. Anticholinesterase activity of the compounds was determined using Ellman’s method. Molecular docking studies were done by using the ADT package version 1.5.6rc3 and showed by Maestro. RMSD values were obtained using Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm and scoring function of AutoDock 4.2 release 4.2.5.1 software. Results: The activities of the compounds were compared with galantamine as cholinesterase enzyme inhibitor, where some of the compounds showed higher BChE inhibitory activity than galantamine. Compound F111 was shown to be the best BChE inhibitor effective in 50 µM dose, providing 89.43% inhibition of BChE (IC50=4.27±0.36 µM). Conclusion: This study supports that novel hydrazone derivates may be used for the development of new BChE inhibitory agents. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={In this work the (poly)-phenolic profile of Moringa oleifera leaves was comprehensively investigated through untargeted metabolomics, following a homogenizer-assisted extraction (HAE) using three solvent systems, i.e. methanol (HAE-1), methanol-water 50:50 v/v (HAE-2) and ethyl acetate (HAE-3). This approach allowed to putatively annotate 291 compounds, recording mainly flavonoids and phenolic acids. Thereafter, antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial activity and enzyme inhibition were assayed in the different extracts. HAE-1 extract showed the highest total phenolic content (31.84 mg/g), followed by HAE-2 (26.95 mg/g) and HAE-3 (14.71 mg/g). In addition, HAE-1 and HAE-2 extracts exhibited an expressive activity against Bacillus cereus and Listeria innocua. The HAE-2 leaf extract was characterized by the highest DPPH and ABTS values (being 49.55 and 45.26 mgTE/g), while ferric reducing antioxidant power was found to be higher in HAE-1 (58.26 mgTE/g). Finally, the enzyme inhibitory effects of M. oleifera leaf extracts were investigated against five enzymes, namely acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, α-amylase and α-glucosidase. All of the tested extracts exhibited inhibitory effects on AChE and BChE with a higher activity for HAE-3 and HAE-1, whilst HAE-1 showed the higher impact on tyrosinase, glucosidase and amylase activities. Taken together, these findings suggest that M. oleifera leaf extracts are a good source of bioactive polyphenols with a potential use in food and pharma industries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Neurodegenerative disorders are estimated to become the second leading cause of death worldwide by 2040. Despite the widespread use of diverse allopathic drugs, these brain-associated disorders can only be partially addressed and long term treatment is often linked with dependency and other unwanted side effects. Nature, believed to be an arsenal of remedies for any illness, presents an interesting avenue for the development of novel neuroprotective agents. Interestingly, inhibition of cholinesterases, involved in the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, has been proposed to be neuroprotective. This review therefore aims to provide additional insight via docking studies of previously studied compounds that have shown potent activity against acetylcho-linesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in vitro. Indeed, the determination of potent plant-based ligands for this purpose through in silico methods enables the elimination of lengthy and costly traditional methods of drug discovery. Herein, a literature search was conducted to identify active phytochemicals which are cholinesterase inhibitors. Following which in silico docking methods were applied to obtain docking scores. Compound structures were extracted from online ZINC database and optimized using AM1 implemented in gaus-sian09software. Noteworthy ligands against AChE highlighted in this study include: 19,20-dihydroervahanine A and 19, 20-dihydrotabernamine. Regarding BChE inhibition, the best ligands were found to be 8-C-lavandurylkaempferol, Na-methylepipachysamine D; ebeiedinone; and dictyophlebine. Thus, ligand optimization between such phytochemicals and cholinesterases coupled with in vitro, in vivo studies and randomized clinical trials can lead to the development of novel drugs against neurodegenerative disorders. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent causes of dementia in the world, and no drugs available that can provide a complete cure. Cholinergic neurons of the cerebral cortex of AD patients are lost due to increased activity of cholinesterase enzymes. Objective: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) are the two major classes of cholinesterases in the mammalian brain. The involvement of oxidative stress in the progression of AD is known. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine strong ChE inhibitors with anti-oxidant activity. Methods: In this study, 41 abietane diterpenoids have been assayed for antioxidant and anticholinesterase (both for AChE and BuChE) properties in vitro, which were previously isolated from Salvia species, and structurally determined by spectroscopic methods, particularly intensive 1D-and 2D-NMR and mass experiments. Molecular modeling studies were performed to rationalize the in vitro ChE inhibitory activity of several abietane diterpenoids compared with galantamine. Results: Thirteen out of the tested 41 abietane diterpenoids exhibited at least 50% inhibition on either AChE or BuChE. The strongest inhibitory activity was obtained for Bractealine against BuChE (3.43 µ M) and AChE (33.21 µ M) while the most selective ligand was found to be Hypargenin E against BuChE enzyme (6.93 µM). A full correlation was not found between anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities. The results obtained from molecular modelling studies of Hypargenin E and Bractealine on AChE and BuChE were found to be in accordance with the in vitro anti-cholinesterase activity tests. Conclusion: Abietane diterpenoids are promising molecules for the treatment of mild-moderate AD. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={The present study investigated the capability of an essential oil mix (MO: 1% and 3%) in ameliorating amnesia and brain oxidative stress in a rat model of scopolamine (Sco) and tried to explore the underlying mechanism. The MO was administered by inhalation to rats once daily for 21 days, while Sco (0.7 mg/kg) treatment was delivered 30 min before behavioral tests. Donepezil (DP: 5 mg/kg) was used as a positive reference drug. The cognitive-enhancing effects of the MO in the Sco rat model were assessed in the Y-maze, radial arm maze (RAM), and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. As identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the chemical composition of the MO is comprised by limonene (91.11%), followed by γ-terpinene (2.02%), β-myrcene (1.92%), β-pinene (1.76%), α-pinene (1.01%), sabinene (0.67%), linalool (0.55%), cymene (0.53%), and valencene (0.43%). Molecular interactions of limonene as the major compound in MO with the active site of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was explored via molecular docking experiments, and Van der Waals (vdW) contacts were observed between limonene and the active site residues SER198, HIS438, LEU286, VAL288, and PHE329. The brain oxidative status and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BChE inhibitory activities were also determined. MO reversed Sco-induced memory deficits and brain oxidative stress, along with cholinesterase inhibitory effects, which is an important mechanism in the anti-amnesia effect. Our present findings suggest that MO ameliorated memory impairment induced by Sco via restoration of the cholinergic system activity and brain antioxidant status. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Background: The indole derivatives and the N-phenylpiperazine fragment represent interesting molecular moieties suitable for the research of new potentially biologically active compounds. This study was undertaken to identify if indol-2-carboxylic acid esters containing N-phenylpiperazine moiety possess acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Materials and Methods: The study dealt with the synthesis of a novel series of analogs of 1H-indole-2carboxylic acid and 3-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid. The structure of the derivatives was represented by the indolylcarbonyloxyaminopropanol skeleton with the attached N-phenylpiperazine or diethylamine moiety, which formed a basic part of the molecule. The final products were synthesized as dihydrochloride salts, fumaric acid salts, and quaternary ammonium salts. The first step of the synthetic pathway led to the preparation of esters of 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid from the commercially available 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid. The Fischer indole synthesis was used to synthesize derivatives of 3-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid. Results and Discussion: Final 18 indolylcarbonyloxyaminopropanols in the form of dihydrochlorides, fumarates, and quaternary ammonium salts were prepared using various optimization ways. The very efficient way for the formation of 3-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (Fischer indole cyclization product) was the one-pot synthesis of phenylhydrazine with methyl 2-oxobutanoate with acetic acid and sulphuric acid as catalysts. Conclusion: Most of the derivatives comprised of an attached N-phenylpiperazine group, which formed a basic part of the molecule and in which the phenyl ring was substituted in position C-2 or C-4. The synthesized compounds were subjected to cholinesterase-inhibiting activity evaluation, by modified Ellman method. Quaternary ammonium salt of 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid which contain N-phenylpiperazine fragment with nitro group in position C-4 (7c) demonstrated the most potent activity against acetylcholinesterase. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Therapeutic treatment of cocaine toxicity or addiction is a grand medical challenge. As a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of cocaine toxicity and addiction to develop a highly efficient cocaine hydrolase (CocH) capable of accelerating cocaine metabolism to produce physiologically/biologically inactive metabolites, our previously designed A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutant of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), known as cocaine hydrolase-1 (CocH1), possesses the desirably high catalytic activity against cocaine. The C-terminus of CocH1, truncated after amino acid #529, was fused to human serum albumin (HSA) to extend the biological half-life. The C-terminal HSA-fused CocH1 (CocH1-HSA), known as Albu-CocH1, Albu-CocH, AlbuBChE, Albu-BChE, or TV-1380 in literature, has shown favorable preclinical and clinical profiles. However, the actual therapeutic value of TV-1380 for cocaine addiction treatment is still limited by the short half-life. In this study, we designed and tested a new type of HSA-fused CocH1 proteins, i.e., N-terminal HSA-fused CocH1, with or without a linker between the HSA and CocH1 domains. It has been demonstrated that the catalytic activity of these new fusion proteins against cocaine is similar to that of TV-1380. However, HSA-CocH1 (without a linker) has a significantly longer biological half-life (t1/2 = 14 ± 2 h) compared to the corresponding C-terminal HSA-fused CocH1, i.e., CocH1-HSA (TV-1380 with t1/2 = 5–8 h), in rats. Further, the N-terminal HSA-fused CocH1 proteins with a linker have further prolonged biological half-lives: t1/2 = 17 ± 2 h for both HSA-EAAAK-CocH1 and HSA-PAPAP-CocH1, and t1/2 = 18 ± 3 h for HSA-(PAPAP)2-CocH1. These N-terminal HSA-fused CocH1 proteins may serve as more promising protein drug candidates for cocaine addiction treatment. © 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multi-factorial disorder characterized by impaired memory and cognition deficit. AD is characterized by impaired cholinergic transmission, extracellular amyloid beta deposits, neurofibrillary tangles and oxidative stress. A multi-target directed ligand (MTDL) approach is required to devise a therapeutic strategy against AD. In the present study, Asparagus racemosus aqueous extract was chosen, as it possess abundant medicinal properties including nootropic effect mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts. Moreover, its secondary metabolite sarsasapogenin (SRS) was also selected for this multi-target study for the very first time. The current study demonstrated that sarsasapogenin significantly inhibits key enzymes involved in pathogenesis of AD which are acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), BACE1 and MAO-B in a concentration dependent manner. SRS also exhibited anti-amyloidogenic, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effects by in vitro studies. The IC50 values of SRS is 9.9 μM and 5.4 μM for AChE and BuChE respectively. SRS also significantly inhibited Aβ42 fibrillization up to 68% at 40 μM concentration as compared to control. TEM visualization showed Aβ aggregates as short and scattered fibril clearly indicating SRS significantly inhibited peptide nucleation and fibril formation. Furthermore, the SRS was found to exert neuroprotective effect on PC12 cells against Aβ42 and H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity. The cell survival was 62% and 69% against Aβ42 and H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity, respectively. SRS also inhibited monoaminoxidase-B (MAO-B) and BACE1 enzymes in concentration dependent manner. Molecular docking studies indicated that SRS binds to the catalytic sites of multiple targets (AChE, BuChE, Aβ42, BACE1, and MAO-B) in a significant manner that might having disease-modifying effects. Thus SRS is acting as suitable lead and can be utilised as MTDL compound for factors implicated in AD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The role of fish oil, primrose oil and their mixture in ameliorating the changes in Alzheimer’s like model was evaluated in rats. Primrose oil and primrose/fish oil mixture fatty acids composition was assessed by gas chromatography. The rat experiment consisted of 5 groups; the first fed on balanced diet as control normal (CN); the other four groups treated with intraperitoneal aluminum lactate and consumed dyslipidemic diet; one group served as control Alzheimer’s like disease (CA) while the other three groups (test groups) received daily oral dose from primrose oil, fish oil and primrose/fish oil mixture separately for 5 weeks. Results showed primrose oil and primrose/ fish oil mixture to contain gamma linolenic acid as 9.15 and 4.3% of total fatty acids, respectively. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic were present as 10.9 and 6.5 %, respectively in the oil mixture. Dyslipidemia and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), brain malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO with decrease in plasma magnesium, brain catalase, reduced glutathione, body weight gain and brain weight were demonstrated in CA compared to CN. Brain histopathology and immuno-histochemistry showed neuronal degeneration and neurofibrillary tangles with elevated myeloperoxidase and nuclear factor-kappa B in CA compared to CN. The tested oils demonstrated neuro-protection reflected in the variable significant improvement of biochemical parameters, immuno-histochemistry and brain histopathology. Primrose/fish oil mixture was superior in reducing ESR, brain MDA, plasma activity of BChE and brain histopathological changes along with elevating plasma magnesium. Primrose/fish oil mixture and fish oil were more promising in improving plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) than primrose. Fish oil was the most efficient in improving plasma total cholesterol (T-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol and T-C /HDL-C. Primrose/ fish oil mixture and primrose oil were superior in elevating brain catalase compared to fish oil. Other parameters were equally improved by the different oil treatments. Primrose oil, fish oil and their mixture reduced the progression of Alzheimer’s disease in rats with superiority to primrose/fish oil mixture. © 2020 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.},

abstract={Background: Medicinal plants and their products are gaining global popularity due to their several health benefits. However, the biological activities of the vast majority of medicinal plant species have not been explored yet. In this study, we evaluated the enzyme inhibitory potential of six medicinal plant species involved in digestion, skin-related problems, and neurological problems. Methods: The 80% methanol extracts of leaves of six locally available plants from the Bagmati province of Nepal were analyzed for their flavonoids content, phenolics content, antioxidant activity, and enzymes inhibitory potential. Antioxidant activity was analyzed by the DPPH assay. Alpha-amylase inhibition was carried out by the DNSA method. Lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitions were analyzed by using p-NPB, L-DOPA, AAAPVN, acetylthiocholine, and butyrylthiocholine as a respective substrate. Results: Among the analyzed plants species, Artocarpus heterophyllus displayed highest α-amylase (IC50=6.28 ± 0.01 µg/mL), lipase (IC50=475.14 ± 3.17 µg/mL), elastase (IC50=72.75 ± 3.41 µg/mL) and acetylcholinesterase (IC50= 68.66 ± 1.71 µg/mL) inhibition, whereas, Actinidia deliciosa displayed highest tyrosinase inhibition (IC50=139.87 ± 0.72 µg/mL) and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition (IC50=18.32 ± 0.44 µg/mL). Furthermore, Jasminum humile showed no inhibitory tendencies against elastase and Lygodium japonicum showed no inhibition towards lipase and elastase at the given concentration range. Conclusion: Our study revealed that A. deliciosa and A. heterophyllus are the potential source of α-amylase, lipase, elastase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. Based on our findings, we concluded that the analyzed plant species are of great scientific interest to the pharma-ceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

The composition and biological activities of essential oils extracted from immature cones, juvenile needles and male inflorescences were analyzed for the first time. The common compounds of the investigated essential oils were α-pinene (6.4 to 46.1 %), β-myrcene (5.5 to 28.3 %), β-caryophyllene (1.3 to 32.8 %), β-caryophyllene oxide (2.7 to 66.6 %) and α-humulene (2.4 to 5.8 %). Significant variations of essential oil composition were detected between the investigated plant parts. The analyzed essential oils exhibited antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities. These activities varied significantly among organs. The essential oil of needles showed the highest antiradical activity with DPPH assay (0.31 mg eq Trolox/g EO). However, for ABTS radical scavenging assay, juvenile needles showed the uppermost antioxidant activity (2.52 mg eq Trolox/g EO). Male inflorescences possessed the most important chelating activity (267.43 mg eq EDTA/g EO). Essential oils of juvenile needles exhibited the highest antiacetylcholinesterase activity (1.37 mg eq dopenzil/g EO). Male inflorescences revealed the most important activity against butyrylcholinesterase (57.442 mg eq dopenzil/g EO). © 2020 Har Krishan Bhalla & Sons.},

abstract={Purpose: To investigate the pharmacological properties of the medicinally active metabolites of Ziziphus oxyphylla. Methods: Compound I-IV were isolated form the root of Ziziphus oxyphylla (compound I = Stigmasterol, II = Betulinic acid, III = 1,2,3 benzene triol and IV = 5-Pentadecanoic acid). Various spectroscopic techniques were used to identify and characterize the isolated compounds. DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays were employed to determine the antioxidant potentials of these compounds. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition potential of the isolated compounds were also evaluated. Results: Amongst the isolated compounds, compound IV was the most potent antioxidant against DPPH and ABTS free radicals, exhibiting half-maximal concentration (IC50) values of 64 and 65 μg/mL, respectively. All the compounds exhibited good inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. However, stigmasterol was more potent than the other isolated compounds, showing IC50 of 85.10 ± 1.45 and 84.81 ± 1.17, respectively, against AChE and BChE. Conclusion: Although, all isolated compounds inhibited the selected free radicals (DPPH and ABTS) and cholinesterases, stigmasterol and 5-penatadecanoic acid were more potent than other two compounds. Thus the former can potentially be used to treat oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2020 The authors.},

abstract={Background: Acetylcholine deficiency in the hippocampus and cortex, aggregation of amyloid-beta, and beta-secretase overactivity have been introduced as the main reasons in the formation of Alzheimer’s disease. Objective: A new series of cinnamic derived acids linked to 1-benzyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities. Methods: Colorimetric Ellman’s method was used for the determination of IC50% of AchE and BuChE inhibitory activity. The kinetic studies, neuroprotective activity, BACE1 inhibitory activity, evaluation of inhibitory potency on Aβ1-42 self-aggregation induced by AchE, and docking study were performed for studying the mechanism of action. Results: Some of the synthesized compounds, compound 7b-4 ((E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-((1(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-yl) methyl) acrylamide) depicted the most potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities (IC50 = 5.27 µM) and compound 7a-1 (N-((1-benzyl1H-1, 2, 3-triazole-4-yl) methyl) cinnamamide) demonstrated the most potent butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities (IC50 = 1.75 µM). Compound 7b-4 showed neuroprotective and β-secretase (BACE1) inhibitory activitiy. In vivo studies of compound 7b-4 in Scopolamine-induced dysfunction confirmed memory improvement. Conclusion: It should be noted that molecular modeling (compounds 7b-4 and 7a-1) and kinetic studies (compounds 7a-1 and 7b-4) showed that these synthesis compounds interacted simultaneously with both the catalytic site (CS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE and BuChE. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Abstract: A series of novel N-substituted α-aminophosphonates-bearing chromone moiety were synthesized and evaluated for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities and antioxidant properties. Porcine pancreatic lipase was employed as a catalyst. Inhibitory activity against AChE ranged between 0.103 and 5.781 µM, whereas for BuChE, activities ranged between 8.619 and 18.789 µM. The results show that among the various synthesized compounds, strongest AChE inhibition was found for the compound containing aliphatic amine analogs, while in case of BuChE, aromatic amines showed better activity as compared to aliphatic amines. Compound 4j was found to be the most potent inhibitor of AChE with an IC50 value of 0.103 ± 0.24 μM and inhibited AChE through mixed-type inhibition. Compound 4j was twofolds more potent than tacrine, 35-folds potent than galantamine and 50-folds potent than rivastigmine. Also, docking study revealed that compound 4j binds to both the peripheral anionic site and catalytic anionic site of AChE and BuChE. The antioxidant activities of synthesized compounds were performed against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and hydrogen peroxide scavenging. DNA nicking activity of selected compounds also suggested that the compounds do not harm plasmid DNA pBR322. Compound 4j also showed significant DNA damage protection activity.

abstract={The genus Minthostachys belonging to the Lamiaceae family, and is an important South American mint genus used commonly in folk medicine as an aroma in cooking. The phytochemical-rich samples of the aerial parts of Minthostachys diffusa Epling. were tested for pharmacological and health-promoting bioactivities using in vitro chemical and enzymatic assays. A range of radical scavenging activities of the samples against biological radicals such as nitric oxide and superoxide anion and against synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals, the ferric reducing antioxidant power and the lipid peroxidation inhibition were determined and ranked using the 'relative antioxidant capacity index' (RACI). The ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest RACI of +1.12. Analysis of the various fractions' inhibitory ability against enzymes involved in diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), and against enzymes associated with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) also suggested that the ethyl acetate fraction was the most active. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction showed more than 30 polyphenolic compounds, including triterpenes. The inhibitory cholinesterase effects of the triterpenes identified from M. diffusa were further analysed by in silico docking of these compounds into 3D-structures of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. This is the first study on pharmacological activities and phytochemical profiling of the aerial parts of M. diffusa, showing that this plant, normally used as food in South America, is also rich in health-promoting phytochemicals. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Crotalaria retusa L. (Fabaceae) also known as ‘rattlebox’ has been used in traditional medicine for the management of various human ailments. The present study comparatively evaluated the α-amylase, α-glucosidase, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase inhibitory activity, antioxidant properties, as well as phytochemical profiles of extracts of C. retusa (bark, fruits, and flowers) obtained by homogenization, maceration, ultrasonication, and Soxhlet extractions. Little variation was noted between the phytochemical profiles obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of C. retusa same plant parts extracted by different methods while the different plant parts showed specific phytochemical fingerprints. For instance, myricetin was identified in C. retusa fruits only. Fruit and bark extracts possessed the highest concentrations of quercetin and rutin, respectively. p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a phenolic derivative of benzoic acid, was identified in all C. retusa plant parts. Spectrophotometric determinations revealed that C. retusa bark extracts have highest concentrations of phenolic and flavonoids. Besides, C. retusa bark extracts showed highest antioxidant capacity. The extracts showed high inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase (21.22–4.81 mmol acarbose equivalent/g), acetylcholinesterase (8.71–8.26 mg galantamine equivalent/g), butyrylcholinesterase (4.16–2.36 mg galantamine equivalent/g), and tyrosinase (133.11–125.26 mg kojic acid equivalent/g). Multivariate component analysis showed that the plant part was the main factor responsible for the observed variability between the extracts.

Additionally, the antioxidant properties of both extracts were determined and their polyphenolic compositions were evaluated by LC-MS/MS. For estimation of the antioxidant capacities of methanolic extract of pennyroyal (MEP) and water extract of pennyroyal (WEP); 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid radical (ABTS•+), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH•), and N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD•+) scavenging activities, Fe3+-2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ), Fe3+, and Cu2+ reducing assays were studied. The IC50 values of the MEP and WEP indicated that they were potent effective DPPH· (16.92 and 18.52 μg/mL), ABTS•+ (7.92 and 9.37 μg/mL) and DMPD•+ (36.02 and 38.94 μg/mL) scavengers, as well as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (40.76 and 60 μg/mL), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (49.51 and 63.03 μg/mL), α-glycosidase (20.38 and 21.65 μg/mL) and α-amylase (23.11 and 36.47 μg/mL) inhibitors. Plant materials are potential sources for novel products in food and pharmaceutical applications. Also, biologically active compounds from plants have proven to be desirable in cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals. This study clearly showed that both MEP and WEP had a broad screening of active compounds and phytochemicals.

abstract={Achillea schischkinii Sosn. is an endemic plant species and it belongs to Asteraceae family. It is distributed widely in the Central and East Anatolia. This study was carried out for evaluation of the antioxidant activity, enzyme inhibition effect, elemental and phenolic content of A. schischkinii. Briefly, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-glycosidase (α-Gly), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes were strongly inhibited by A. schischkinii. IC50 values for AChE, BChE, α-Gly, and GST enzymes were found as 19.3 mg/mL, 15.4 mg/mL, 69.3 mg/mL, and 34.7 mg/mL respectively. The antioxidant activity of the sample was evaluated by four different in vitro bioanalytical methods. Besides, the concentrations of twelve elements in A. schischkinii were analyzed by ICP-MS technique. Zn (50.6 ppm), Mn (23.0 ppm), and Cu (12.7 ppm) were found as major elements. Furthermore, catechin (20.8 µg/mg extract), trans-ferulic acid (18.3 µg/mg extract), and gallic acid (11.2 µg/mg extract) were characterized as major phenolic compounds by using HPLC. Practical applications: Acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, α-glycosidase, and glutathione s-transferase enzymes have crucial functions on metabolism. Enzyme inhibition or activation mostly attributed to some health disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Diabetes mellitus, cancer and hyperglycemia. Phenolic contents are responsible for effective biological activity. This study evaluated the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of Achillea schischkinii as well as the inhibition effect against four metabolic enzymes. The results would be beneficial for using the plant in the food industry and pharmacological process. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Currently approved Alzheimer’s disease medications mainly comprise acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors. Many of these inhibitors are either natural compounds or synthetic molecules inspired in natural compounds. Hybrid molecules that can interact with different target sites of the enzyme could lead to the discovery of effective multitarget drugs. Objective: To design, synthesize, and evaluate a series of new aza-resveratrol analogs as in vitro ace-tyl-and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. Methods: The synthesis is achieved by a simple and efficient microwave-assisted method, from com-mercially available starting materials. Compounds are designed as hybrids of an aza-stilbene nucleus (Schiff base) connected to a tertiary amine by a hydrocarbon chain of variable length, designed to interact both with the peripheric anionic site and the catalytic site of the enzyme. Results: All the derivatives inhibit both enzymes in a concentration-dependent manner, acting as mod-erate to potent cholinesterase inhibitors. The most potent inhibitors are compounds 12b (IC50 = 0.43 µM) and 12a (IC50 = 0.31 µM) for acetyl-and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively. Compounds 12a and 12b also exhibit significant acetylcholinesterase inhibition in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells without cytotoxic properties. Enzyme kinetic studies and molecular modeling reveal that inhibitor 12b targets both the catalytic active site and the peripheral anionic site of acetylcholinesterase what makes it able to modulate the self-induced β-amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, the molecular modeling analysis helps to assess the impact of the linker length in the inhibitory activity of this family of new cholinesterase inhibitors. Conclusion: These compounds have the potential to serve as a dual binding site inhibitor and might provide a useful template for the development of new anti-Alzheimer’s disease agents. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Recently Nutrition and Food Chemistry researches have been focused on plants and their products or their secondary metabolites having anti-alzheimer, anti-cancer, anti-aging, and antioxidant properties. Among these plants Salvia L. (Lamiaceae) species come into prominence with their booster effects due to high antioxidant contents, which have over 900 species in the world and 98 in Turkey. Some Salvia species are already in use as herbal treatment of vessel stiffness, Dementia like problems and cancer. Recently some species of Salvia are of extensive research topic. In this study, inhibitory potentials of secondary metabolites, rosmarinic acid, salvigenin, salvianolic acid A and B, tanshinone I and IIA, cyrtotanshinone, dihydrotanshinone I, carnosic acid, carnosol, and danshensu sodium salt were investigated against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, urease and tyrosinase enzymes both in-vitro and in slico in detail. Elevated inhibitory effects on acetyl-and butyryl-cholinesterase of dihydrotanshinone I (IC50: 1.50 ± 0.02 and 0.50 ± 0.01 µg/mL, respectively), carnasol (IC50: 11.15 ± 0.05 ve 3.92 ± 0.03 µg/mL) and carnosic acid (IC50: 31.83 ± 0.65 ve 4.12±0.04 µg/mL) were observed. Furthermore, all other secondary metabolites were active against butyrylcholinesterase. Anti-urease (42.41 ± 0.85%) and anti-tyrosinase (39.82 ± 1.16%) activities of tanshinone I were also observed. Potential inhibitory effects of these molecules on target proteins were investigated using DOCK and molecular dynamics calculations. Dock score analysis and Lipinski parameters were demonstrated that these ligands are potential inhibitors against relevant enzymes. Our findings suggest that Salvia species can be utilized as a ptential source of anti-alzheimer active compounds for designing novel products. © 2020, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) exist in a variety of oligomeric forms, each with defined cellular and subcellular distributions. Although crystal structures of AChE and BChE have been available for many years, structures of the physiologically relevant ChE tetramer were only recently solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis. Here, we briefly review how these structures contribute to our understanding of cholinesterase oligomerization, highlighting the advantages of using cryo-EM to resolve structures of protein assemblies that cannot be expressed recombinantly. We argue that the next frontier in cholinesterase structural biology is to image membrane-anchored ChE oligomers directly in their native environment—the cell.

abstract={Mathematical modeling plays an important role in adjusting the parameters to achieve the desired characteristics of electrochemical biosensors. The investigation of a mathematical model of a potentiometric biosensor for the measurement of a-chaconine is carried out. The mathematical model of the investigation biosensor is presented in the form of a system of impulsive differential equations describing the dynamics of biochemical reactions when the concentration of a-chaconine is measured. In the model of the biosensor, each of the differential equations describes the concentrations of enzyme, substrate, inhibitor, enzyme-substrate, enzyme-inhibitor, enzyme-substrate-inhibitory complexes, as well as product depending on time simulation of mathematical model of biosensor for measurement of a-chaconine using R package is performed. The impulsive values of the system are the initial concentrations of the enzyme in the form of butyrylcholinesterase, the substrate in the form of butyryl choline chloride and a-chaconine as inhibitors. An existing potentiometric biosensor based on immobilized butyrylcholinesterase was used to verify the model and compare it with the experimental response. Conditions of local asymptotical stability for the inhibition stage in terms of corresponding eigenvalues is obtained. Nontrivial steady state of the model of biosensor for the measurement of a-chaconine can be numerically calculated as a positive solution of the system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The absolute value of the error between the experimental and simulated biosensor reactions for measuring α-haconin, which does not exceed 5.7 μA, was calculated. The root mean square error between the experimental and simulated biosensor reactions for measuring α-haconin is 1.6 μA, which corresponds to 5.33%. Based on the results of numerical simulations of the biosensor allows to adequately determine all major components of the compartment components of biochemical reactions when measuring a-chaconine concentration. The use of numerical simulation results will further minimize laboratory experiments with toxic and costly substances to select optimal concentrations of biosensor components to determine a-chaconine. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of heat treatment combined with enzyme preparations on the antioxidant and anticholinesterase activity of bilberry juices. Each bilberry juice efficiently ‘scavenged’ DPPH and ABTS radicals. The highest ability to remove DPPH radicals was found in pre-heated (80-90°C, 5 min) and non-heated (only 50-55°C, 2 h) juices obtained using Pectinex BE XXL. The pre-heating treatment caused an increase in the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity compared to non-heated juices, with the highest elevation (p < 0.05) recorded for juice produced using Panzym BE XXL. Similarly, the heat pretreatment caused an increase in the anti-butyrylcholinesterase activity in bilberry juices. The combined application of pre-heating and enzyme preparations during juice processing resulted in an increase in the antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of the end juices. © Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Lublinie.},

The antioxidant potential was confirmed by the DPPH (22.5%) and ABTS (62.7%) assays, and the total phenolic compound content was 40 µg gallic acid equivalents/mg. The extract E-G6-32 displayed good inhibitory activity toward butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; IC50 = 110 ± 0.05 µg mL−1). The extract E-G6-32 was subjected to spectroscopic and mass spectrometry analyses. Comparison with the literature data confirmed that (-)-asperpentyn (1) was a major component. Asperpentyn belongs to the epoxyquinone family, which has attractive structural complexity, diverse functional groups, and a broad range of biological activities, including specific enzyme inhibitory activity.

abstract={The phenolic profile, antioxidant, and anticholinesterase activities of teas prepared from two Sideritis (L.) species: Sideritis perfoliata subsp. athoa (Papan. &amp; Kokkini) Baden and Sideritis trojana Bornm., collected from Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı) Turkey, were determined. The teas were prepared by infusion and decoction methods. The quantitative amounts of the phenolic contents were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The significant phytochemicals were found to be fumaric acid for infusion and decoction samples of S. trojana and infusion of S. perfoliata subsp. athoa, chlorogenic acid for decoction of S. perfoliata subsp. athoa. The tea samples prepared by the decoction method were found to be rich in phenolics. Apart from the fact that the decoction sample of S. trojana exhibited the best antioxidant effect in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), β-carotene bleaching and cupric (Cu2+) ion reducing power assay (CUPRAC) methods among the tested samples at all concentrations, and showed significant inhibition effect at 200 μg/mL against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes (59.74%, 64.99%, respectively). © 2020, Turkish Chemical Society.

abstract={Objectives: Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are well known for their wide range of pharmacological activities. Galanthamine, an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid, is an effective, selective, reversible, and competitive cholinesterase inhibitor marketed under different commercial names in several countries for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of this work was to study the alkaloid profiles of the aerial parts and bulbs of both flowering and fruiting periods of Galanthus fosteri Baker (Amaryllidaceae), as well as analyzing their inhibitory activities on both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) for the first time. Materials and Methods: The alkaloid profiles of the four samples were determined by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and AChE and BuChE inhibition assays were performed by the modified Ellman method. Results: Totally, 22 compounds with mass spectral characteristics of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were detected in the extracts. Significant AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities were observed in the tested samples (IC50 between 0.189 and 91.23 µg/mL). Conclusion: This study shows that G. fosteri, collected from Akdağ, Amasya (Turkey), is a potential source of diverse chemical structures of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids with cholinesterase inhibitory properties. ©Turk J Pharm Sci, Published by Galenos Publishing House.},

In vitro cholinergic enzymes inhibition potential of all compounds was tested. Enzyme inhibition assays showed that some hybrids exhibited significant potency to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Especially, the hybrid compound 5n presented the more effective inhibition against AChE (4.24 µM) with an acceptable selectivity index versus BChE (SI: 5.19), while compound 6aa exhibited the greatest inhibition activity on BChE (3.97 µM) and a significant selectivity index against AChE (SI: 0.04). Kinetic studies were carried out for compounds with greater inhibitory activity of cholinesterases. Structure–activity relationships of the molecular hybrids were analyzed, through computational models using a molecular cross-docking algorithm and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area(MM/GBSA) binding free energy approach, which indicated a good correlation between the experimental inhibition values and the predicted free binding energy. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) do not include only memory loss and cognitive decline but also neuropsychiatric manifestation. These AD-related symptoms are usually treated with the aid of antipsychotics; however, their effects on cognition and safety remain unexplored. The present study determines the effects of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, and two imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine-based inhibitors of PDE10A on the activity of human cholinesterases. Quetiapine moderately inhibited BuChE (IC50 = 6.08 ± 1.64 µmol/L) but improved the anti-BuChE properties of donepezil by decreasing its IC50 value. Both PDE10A inhibitors were found to possess moderate anti-AChE properties. The combined mixtures of donepezil and imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine analogues produce a synergistic anti-BuChE effect which was greater than either compound alone, improving the IC50 value by approximately six times. These favourable interactions between quetiapine, PDE10A inhibitors and clinically approved donepezil, resulting in improved anti-BuChE activity, can lead to a wider variety of potent AD treatment options. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by a low level of acetylcholine, beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and oxidative stress. Donepezil is the core medicine used for the treatment of AD. Various structural modifications of donepezil have been carried out. Benzylpiperidine part of donepezil has been replaced with benzylpyridine, pyridyl methylpiperidine, benzylpiperazine, pyrimidyl piperazine. These derived molecules showed promising activities as anti-Alzheimer agents. Replacement of indanone part by other heterocyclic rings such as pyridine resulted in the formation of compounds which exhibited monoamine oxidase (MAO) as well as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. Propargylamine containing derivatives displayed AChE as well as MAO inhibition properties. Attachment of donepezil with natural compounds like ferulic acid, flavonoids, and curcumin showed antioxidant activities in addition to inhibition of the AChE. Benzylpiperidine and benzylpiperazine have also been combined with condensed heterocyclic rings and these compounds displayed promising anti-Alzheimer properties.

abstract={In search of a novel class of compounds against Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a new series of 7-chloro-aminoquinoline derivatives containing methylene spacers of different sizes between the 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline nucleus and imino methyl substituted phenolic rings, and also their reduced analogues, were designed, synthesized and evaluated as neuroprotective agents for AD in vitro. In spite of the multifaceted feature of AD, cholinesterases continue to be powerful and substantial targets, as their inhibition increases both the level and duration of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter action. The compounds presented inhibitory activity in the micromolar range against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (imines and amines) and butyrylcholineterase (BChE) (amines). The SAR study revealed that elongation of the imine side chain improved AChE activity, whereas the reduction of these compounds to amines was crucial for higher activity and indispensable for BChE inhibition. The most promising selective inhibitors were not cytotoxic and did not stimulate pro-inflammatory activity in glial cells. Kinetic and molecular modeling studies indicated that they also show mixed-type inhibition for both enzymes, behaving as dual-site inhibitors, which can interact with both the peripheral anionic site and the catalytic anionic site of AChE. They could therefore restore cholinergic transmission and also may inhibit the aggregation of Aβ promoted by AChE. Additionally, one compound showed promising anti-inflammatory activity by reducing the microglial release of NO• at a concentration that is equivalent to the IC50 against BChE (30.32 ± 0.18 µM) and 15-fold greater than the IC50 against AChE (1.97 ± 0.20 µM).

abstract={In this study, the essential oils (EOs) of six Algerian plants (Artemisia campestris L., Artemisia herba-alba Asso, Juniperus phoenicea L., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Mentha pulegium L. and Lavandula officinalis Chaix) were obtained by hydrodistillation, and their compositions determined by GC-MS and GC-FID. The antioxidant activity of the EOS was evaluated via 2,20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric-reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays. Moreover, their cytotoxic effect was evaluated-as well as their tyrosinase, acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) inhibitory activities. The chemical analyses detected 44, 45, 51, 53, 26 and 40 compounds in EOs of A. campestris, A. herba-alba, J. phoenicea, J. oxycedrus, M. pulegium and L. officinalis, respectively. A. campestris EO was mainly composed of β-pinene (20.7%), while A. herba-alba EO contained davanone D (49.5%) as the main component. α-Pinene (41.8%) was detected as the major constituent in both J. phoenicea (41.8%) and J. oxycedrus (37.8%) EOs. M. pulegium EO was characterized by pulegone as the most abundant (76.9%) compound, while linalool (35.8%) was detected as a major constituent in L. officinalis EO. The antioxidant power evaluation revealed IC50 values ranging from 2.61 to 91.25 mg/mL for DPPH scavenging activity, while the FRAP values ranged from 0.97-8.17 µmol Trolox equivalents (TX)/g sample. In the ABTS assay, the values ranged from 7.01 to 2.40 µmol TX/g sample. In the presence of 1 mg/mL of the samples, tyrosinase inhibition rates ranged from 11.35% to 39.65%, AChE inhibition rates ranged from 40.57% to 73.60% and BuChE inhibition rates ranged from 6.47% to 72.03%. A significant cytotoxic effect was found for A. herba-alba EO. The obtained results support some of the traditional uses of these species in food preservation and for protection against several diseases. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={Cocaine addiction continues to impose major burdens on affected individuals and broader society but is highly resistant to medical treatment or psychotherapy. This study was undertaken with the goal of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permission for a first-in-human clinical trial of a gene therapy for treatment-seeking cocaine users to become and remain abstinent. The approach was based on intravenous administration of AAV8-hCocH, an adeno-associated viral vector encoding a modified plasma enzyme that metabolizes cocaine into harmless by-products. To assess systemic safety, we conducted "Good Laboratory Practice" (GLP) studies in cocaine-experienced and cocaine-naive mice at doses of 5E12 and 5E13 vector genomes/kg. Results showed total lack of viral vector-related adverse effects in all tests performed. Instead, mice given one injection of AAV8-hCocH and regular daily injections of cocaine had far less tissue pathology than cocaine-injected mice with no vector treatment. Biodistribution analysis showed the vector located almost exclusively in the liver. These results indicate that a liver-directed AAV8-hCocH gene transfer at reasonable dosage is safe, well tolerated, and effective. Thus, gene transfer therapy emerges as a radically new approach to treat compulsive cocaine abuse. In fact, based on these positive findings, the FDA recently accepted our latest request for investigational new drug application (IND 18579). © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease, a major and increasing global health challenge, is an irreversible, progressive form of dementia, associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. The etiology of this disease is not completely understood, and no safe and effective anti-Alzheimer’s disease drug to prevent, stop, or reverse its evolution is currently available. Current pharmacotherapy concentrated on drugs that aimed to improve the cerebral acetylcholine levels by facilitating cholinergic neurotransmission through inhibiting cholinesterase. These compounds, recognized as cholinesterase inhibitors, offer a viable target across key sign domains of Alzheimer’s disease, but have a modest influence on improving the progression of this condition. In this paper, we sought to highlight the current understanding of the cholinergic system involvement in Alzheimer’s disease progression in relation to the recent status of the available cholinesterase inhibitors as effective therapeutics. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex, neurodegenerative pathology showing, among others, high cholinergic and neurotransmitter deficits, oxidative stress, inflammation, Aβ-aggregation resulting in senile plaques formation, and hyperphosphorylation of tau-protein leading to neurofibrillary tangles. Due to its multifactorial and complex nature, multitarget directed small-molecules able to simultaneously inhibit or bind diverse biological targets involved in the progress and development of AD are considered now the best therapeutic strategy to design new compounds for AD therapy. Among them, tacrine is a very well known standard-gold ligand, and natural products have been a traditional source of new agents for diverse therapeutic treatments. In this review, we will update recent developments of multitarget tacrinenatural products hybrids for AD therapy. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={An artificial series of macrocycles based on 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol intermediate was synthesized using a multistep procedure involving oxidation of bisphenol sulfide, etherification of phenolic hydroxyl groups, and final ring closure with different diamines. Different chemical species having aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic characters were incorporated into macrocyclic frameworks in the final step of ring closure. This simple and easily executable synthetic strategy was applied to synthesize 15 macrocycles (5a-o) in excellent yields. Characterization of the synthesized products was achieved through well-known modern spectroscopic techniques such as IR, NMR, and Mass. Macrocycles 5m and 5n were found to show significant AChE inhibition with IC50 values of 76.9 ± 0.24 and 71.2 ± 0.77 μM, respectively. Macrocycle 5n was also found to be an active inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with IC50 score of 55.3 ± 0.54 μM. Among others, macrocycle 5l cyclized with o-phenylenediamine demonstrated moderate inhibition with IC50 value of 81.1 ± 0.54 μM. Increasing interest in studying interactions of macrocycles with different enzymatic targets compelled us to design and synthesize sulfone-based macrocycles that might prove as highly potent class of biologically active compounds. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, LLC.},

abstract={Lathyrus species are economically important as food, fodder, and folk medicine. The antioxidant properties (radical scavenging effectiveness, reducing power potentials, metal chelating ability, phosphomolydenum capacity) phytochemical characterization (phenolic composition), and enzyme inhibition abilities of the water and ethyl acetate extracts of Lathyrus czeczottianus (LC) were tested. The phenolic ingradients of LC extracts were evaluated by HPLC-DAD (High-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector). Chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and benzoic acid were found as main phenolic compounds in both extracts. Generally, the water extract revealed strong antioxidant potential. The antioxidant effectiveness could be explained by high total phenolic level in the extract. Regarding enzyme inhibitory results, the ethyl acetate extract indicated good inhibitory activities on cholinesterase (for AChE: Acetylccholinesterase 1.15 mg galathamine equivalents (GALAE/g extract) and for BChE: Butyrylcholinesterase 0.19 mg GALAE/g extrac), tyrosinase (54.48 mg kojic acid equivalents (KAE/g)), and α-amylase (0.34 mmol acarbose equivalents (ACEs/g)), while the water extract had just good inhibition on α-glucosidase (6.49 mmol ACEs/g).

abstract={In this work, we report the phenolic composition and bioactivity of the aerial parts of three species of Sarcocapnos (S. enneaphylla, S. pulcherrima, and S. saetabensis) to study their potential as sources of bioactive compounds to revalorize them and contribute to the conservation of these plant species. Samples were collected in different locations in the province of Jaén (southeast of Spain), and qualitative and quantitative analyses of phenolic compounds were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array and mass spectrometry detection. S. enneaphylla presented the highest concentration of phenolic compounds (58 mg/g DE). The most abundant compound in S. enneaphylla and S. saetabensis was rutin (35 mg/g DE and 11.7 mg/g DE, respectively), whereas isorhamnetin-O-rutinoside was dominant in S. pulcherrima (11.5 mg/g DE). Several assays were performed to evaluate the potential bioactivity of the three species of Sarcocapnos. These assays included antioxidant and radical scavenging (ABTS and DPPH), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP), phosphomolybdenum and metal chelating, and enzyme inhibitory activity (acetylcholinesterase, amylase, butyrylcholinesterase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase). In general, all methanolic extracts presented the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents, as well as the highest radical scavenging, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory properties.

abstract={Neurodegenerative disorders in the elderly are characterized by gradual loss of memory and cognitive function. Oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species is associated with progressive neuronal cell damage and death in Alzheimer's disease, one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. An edible brown seaweed, Ecklonia cava, contains a variety of biologically active compounds such as phlorotannins. In this study, we comparatively evaluated the total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and neuroprotective effects of the phlorotannin-rich extract from E. cava (PEEC). The total phenolic content of PEEC and dieckol was 810.8 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g and 996.6 mg GAE/g, respectively. Antioxidant capacity of PEEC was 1,233.8 mg vitamin C equivalents (VCE)/g and 392.1 mg VCE/g determined using ABTS and DPPH assays, respectively, while those of dieckol were 2,238.4 mg VCE/g and 817.7 mg VCE/g. High-performance liquid chromatography results revealed 48.08 ± 0.67 mg dieckol/g of PEEC. PEEC had neuroprotective effects in pheochromocytoma (PC-12) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells against H2O2- and AAPH-induced oxidative damage, partly due to reduced intracellular oxidative stress. PEEC treatment inhibited acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that PEEC is a good source of antioxidants and neuroprotective materials. © 2020 Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, which is the most common cause of dementia. The aging population means that the number of people suffering from AD is expected to increase each year if there is no effective treatment found. One of the strategies for the treatment of AD is the use of cholinesterase inhibitors. Plants have been the source of many bioactive metabolites, including cholinesterase inhibitors. The objective of this study is to investigate the potency of several plant extracts from the genus Cassia as cholinesterase inhibitors. The cholinesterase inhibitory screening was carried out against two enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), according to the modified Ellman’s method. The chemistry of the active fractions was studied by LC-MS/MS method. The results suggested that amongst six plant extracts from the genus Cassia investigated, the ethanolic extract of Cassia spectabilis showed the strongest inhibition against both AChE and BChE enzymes, with IC50 values of 39.5 and 36.9 µg/mL, respectively. Investigation on the n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and nbutanol fractions obtained from the C. spectabilis extract showed that the ethyl acetate and the n-butanol fractions gave better inhibitory activity compared to the n-hexane fraction. Based on the LC-MS/MS data, the two active fractions gave similar profile. Both fractions contained alkaloid cassine and spectaline, which may responsible for the cholinesterase inhibitory activity. © 2020 Marmara University Press.},

abstract={In a world where an eco-friendlier approach is becoming more and more necessary, it is essential to reduce waste production and to reuse residues of the company’s supply chain. Coffee silverskin (CS) and spent coffee ground (SCG), two by-products of coffee production, are important sources of bioactive compounds and, for this, some authors have proposed their reuse in the nutraceutical, food, and cosmetic sector. However, their potential enzyme inhibitory properties have been poorly investigated. Hence, the objective of the current work was to study the enzymatic inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and tyrosinase of different extracts of CS and SCG. Before these in vitro bioassays, the phytochemical composition of each extract was investigated via colorimetric assays and HPLC-MS/MS analysis. In addition, the antioxidant activities were evaluated by different chemical approaches. SCG extracts contained a higher content of bioactive compounds, notably the SCG EtOH:H2O extract was the richest in caffeine and possessed the highest antioxidant activities. The hydroalcoholic and methanolic extracts were shown to be the most active against all tested enzymes, while the water extracts displayed lower activity. Our results showed a weak correlation between bioactive compounds and enzyme inhibitory effects, proving inhibitory activities likely due to non-phenolic molecules such as alkaloids and terpenoids. Obtained findings could be a starting point to develop novel nutraceuticals from CS and SCG. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={Thioureas and their derivatives are organosulfur compounds having applications in numerous fields such as organic synthesis and pharmaceutical industries. Symmetric thiourea derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of various anilines with CS2. The synthesized compounds were characterized using the UV-visible and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques. The compounds were screened for in vitro inhibition of α-amylase, α-glucosidase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymes and for their antibacterial and antioxidant potentials. These compounds were fed to Swiss male albino mice to evaluate their toxicological effects and potential to inhibit glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) inhibition. The antibacterial studies revealed that compound 4 was more active against the selected bacterial strains. Compound 1 was more active against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radicals, AChE, BuChE, and α-glucosidase. Compound 2 was more potent against α-amylase and G6Pase. Toxicity studies showed that compound 4 is safe as it exerted no toxic effect on any of the hematological and biochemical parameters or on liver histology of the experimental animals at any studied dose rate. The synthesized compounds showed promising antibacterial and antioxidant potential and were very active (both in vitro and in vivo) against G6Pase and moderately active against the other selected enzymes used in this study. © 2020 Sumaira Naz et al., published by De Gruyter 2020.},

The potential of kolaviron, a biflavonoid from Garcinia kola to stimulate glucose uptake and suppress glucose-induced oxidative toxicity were investigated in rat brain. Its molecular interactions with the target proteins were investigated in silico. Kolaviron was incubated with excised rat brain in the presence of glucose for 2 h, with metformin serving as a positive control. Kolaviron caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in glucose uptake, glutathione level, superoxide dismutase, catalase, ATPase, ENTPDase and 5’-nucleotidase activities, while concomitantly depleting malondialdehyde level, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities compared to brains incubated with glucose only. Electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) analysis revealed kolaviron had little or no effect on the ultrastructural morphology of brain tissues as evidenced by the intact dendritic and neuronal network, blood vessels, mitochondria, synaptic vesicles, and pre-synaptic membrane. SEM-EDX analysis revealed a restorative effect of glucose-induced alteration in brain elemental concentrations, with total depletion of aluminum and zinc. MTT analysis revealed kolaviron had no cytotoxic effect on HT-22 cells. Molecular docking revealed a potent interaction between kolaviron and catalase at the SER114 and MET350 residues, with a binding energy of 12 kcal/mol. Taken together, these results portray the potential of kolaviron to stimulate glucose uptake while concomitantly coffering a neuroprotective effect. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society},

abstract={Biosynthesis has emerged as an exciting interface for assembling multifunctional metal oxide nanoparticles for diverse medicinal applications. Herein, biogenic nickel oxide (NiO-NPs) is synthesized by using floral extracts of Callistemon viminalis (C. viminalis) as a low cost, ecofriendly reducing and stabilizing agent. NiO-NPs were annealed at 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C while their physiochemical properties were established by HR-SEM/TEM, UV, XRD, FTIR, EDS, SAED and SQUID techniques. Particle size of NiO-NPs decreased with increase in annealing temperatures. Magnetization curves indicated superparamagnetic behavior of the biogenic NiO-NPs at 300 K. Highly crystalline NiO-NPs obtained after annealing at 500 °C were used for biomedical applications. The anti-leishmanial activity on Leishmania tropica promastigotes (KMH-23) and anticancer activity on HepG2 (RCB1648) revealed excellent inhibition potential with IC50 of 37.21 µg/mL and 47 µg/mL, respectively. Significant antibacterial effect was observed against Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus vulgaris with MIC’s of 12.5 µg/mL each. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and α-glucosidase inhibitory potential were comparable with positive control drugs. Moderate antioxidant activities were observed. NiO-NPs were observed to be hemolytic (30%) at higher dose (1000 µg/mL). Overall, NiO-NPs revealed a multifunctional nature that can be explored for diverse biomedical applications.

abstract={Many species of the Allium genus, principally the cultivated forms, are widely used as vegetables, spices and natural therapeutics due to their beneficial health properties. This study aimed to identify the phenolic composition and biological activities of the bulb, stem and flower parts of Allium pallens L., collected from two different localities. A total of 28 phenolic compounds were investigated by LC-ESI-MS/MS, and gallic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and benzoic acid were found to be the major phenolic compounds in the plants from both locations. Total phenolic- and flavonoid-content analyses of samples were carried out using spectrophotometry, and the stem extracts were found to be rich in phenolics. DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and CUPRAC assays were used to determine the antioxidant capacities of the extracts. A linear relation was observed between the phenolic contents of the extracts and their antioxidant activities, and the stem extracts of plants from both locations were found to have potent antioxidant capacity. The inhibitory activities of the extracts against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and tyrosinase were determined using a 96-well microplate reader. The antibutyrylcholinesterase activity of the extracts was found to be the highest. The outcomes of these investigations were further explored, and the underlying structure of multivariate data was revealed using principal component analysis. This study presents the distribution of chemical constituents and biological activities of the different parts of A. pallens, and also contributes to further investigations of Allium species. © 2020 by the Serbian Biological Society.},

abstract={An abundant literature suggests that obesity-associated with taking a high fat diet is related to an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, metabolic disorders may be involved in the induction of the anxiogenic-like symptoms. The current study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which a high fat diet (HFD) can cause several complications in the WISTAR rats (Rattus norvegicus) brain. Oxidative stress and inflammation as well as the putative protection afforded by chamomile decoction extract (CDE) were also studied. The results demonstrated that the increased body and brain weight, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities as well as hypercholezterolaemia in response to HFD taking were correlated with anxiogenic-like symptoms. Moreover, HFD feed caused a brain oxidative stress characterized by increased lipoperoxidation, inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities such as SOD, CAT and GPx, depletion of a non-enzymatic antioxidant such as sulfhydryl groups and GSH. Importantly, the results also show that HFD also provoked a cerebral overload in reactive oxygen species such as OH•, H2O2 and (Formula presented.) as well as brain inflammation assessed by the overproduction of cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6. Interestingly, all neurobehavioral changes and all the biochemical and molecular disturbances were abolished in HFD-fed rats treated with CDE. Our results provide clear evidence that obesity and depression as well as anxiety are finely correlated and that M. recutita’s decoction may prove to be a potential therapeutic agent to mitigate the behavioral disorders, the biochemical alterations and the neuroinflammation associated to the obesity. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This study investigated the effect of shaddock peels extract on cognitive function in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Wistar rats were pretreated with shaddock peels extract (50 and 100 mg/kg) and donepezil (5 mg/kg) for fourteen days via oral administration. Memory impairment was induced at the end of the treatment period via a single intraperitoneal administration of scopolamine (3 mg/kg). Thereafter, the animals were subjected to behavioral studies (Morris water maze and Y-maze tests). Finally, the rats were sacrificed and the hippocampus of the rat's brain was isolated for biochemical analyses. The results showed a significant decrease in memory and cognitive function as revealed by Morris water maze and Y-maze tests in scopolamine-induced rats which were reversed by shaddock peels extract. Also, there was a significant decrease in the activity of adenosine monophosphohydrolase (AMPase) with a simultaneous increase in activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA), adenosine triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (ATPdase), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in scopolamine-induced rats when compared with the control. Besides, a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were observed in scopolamine-induced rats. However, donepezil or shaddock peels extract (50 and 100 mg/kg) caused a significant inhibitory effect on AChE, and ADA activities when compared to scopolamine-induced rats. Rats treated with shaddock peels extract also showed a significant reduction in MDA and ROS levels compared to scopolamine-induced rats. Therefore, our findings showed that the cognitive-enhancing effects of shaddock peels extract could be due to antioxidant activities and modulation of some enzymes linked with cognitive dysfunction. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this protocol, a series of 3-benzyloxyflavone derivatives have been designed, synthesized, characterized and investigated in vitro as cholinesterase inhibitors. The findings showed that all the synthesized target compounds (1–10) are potent dual inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes with varying IC50 values. In comparison, they are more active against AChE than BChE. Remarkably, amongst the series, the compound 2 was identified as the most active inhibitor of both AChE (IC50 = 0.05 ± 0.01 μM) and BChE (IC50 = 0.09 ± 0.02 μM) relative to the standard Donepezil (IC50 = 0.09 ± 0.01 for AChE and 0.13 ± 0.04 μM for BChE). Moreover, the derivatives 5 (IC50 = 0.07 ± 0.02 μM) and 10 (0.08 ± 0.02 μM) exhibited the highest selective inhibition against AChE as compared to the standard. Preliminary structure-activity relationship was established and thus found that cholinesterase inhibitory activities of these compounds are highly dependent on the nature and position of various substituents on Ring-B of the 3-Benzyloxyflavone scaffolds. In order to find out the nature of binding interactions of the compounds and active sites of the enzymes, molecular docking studies were carried out. HIGHLIGHTS: 3-benzyloxyflavone analogues were designed, synthesized and characterized. The target molecules (1–10) were evaluated for their inhibitory potential against AChE and BChE inhibitory activities. Limited structure-activity relationship was developed based on the different substituent patterns on aryl part. Molecular docking studies were conducted to correlate the in vitro results and to identify possible mode of interactions at the active pocket site of the enzyme. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by depositions of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides aggregates resulting in plaques formation in the central nervous system (CNS). This study evaluates the disease-modifying potential of scopoletin against multiple factors associated with AD such as cholinesterase enzymes, Aβ peptides, and neuroprotective properties against Aβ- and H2O2-induced cytotoxicity under in vitro conditions. Scopoletin was identified and quantified using UPLC-QTOF (ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. The antiamyloidogenic potential was evaluated by thioflavin T and congo red binding assay. Inhibition of key enzymes, that is, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, was investigated by Ellman’s assay. UPLC-QTOF analysis showed that most abundant phytoconstituent present in Argyreia speciosa hydroalcoholic root extract was scopoletin followed by festuclavine and ergometrine. Scopoletin was further quantified using novel reverse phase (RP)-HPLC method developed in this study. The neuroprotective potential of scopoletin was found to be 69% against Aβ42-induced neurotoxicity and 73% against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cell culture at 40 μM final concentration. At the same concentration, scopoletin inhibited Aβ42 fibril formation up to 57%. The IC50 concentration for AChE and BuChE enzyme inhibition by scopoletin was 5.34 and 9.11 μM, respectively. The antiaggregation and enzyme inhibition results were complemented with strong molecular interactions of scopoletin with target proteins validated by in silico molecular docking analysis. Based on this study, it can be concluded that scopoletin can be used as a lead for amelioration of symptoms and disease-modifying effects in AD. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Tomato is a horticultural crop of interest, that is widely consumed fresh or as processed products. The present investigation was to evaluate the antioxidant indices (total phenolic content, avonoid content, ferric reducing antioxidant power, radical scavenging activities, inhibitory action against lipid oxidation) and anti-cholinesterase action (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) of tomato fruits (ripe and unripe) and pastes (paste 2 and paste 1) after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The total phenolic content (mg/g GAE) of the in vitro digested tomato fruits and pastes showed higher values (ripe tomato: 61.08; tomato paste1: 56.02; tomato paste 2: 60.36; unripe tomato: 38.97) than the ethanolic extracts, with digested ripe tomato ranking higher. Similar results were also obtained for total avonoid content, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and the radical scavenging activities (DPPH*, ABTS+, NO*, OH*), with the in vitro digested samples ranking high. The ability of the enzyme digested and ethanolic extracts of tomato fruits and pastes to inhibit iron and sodium nitroprusside induced lipid oxidation in rat's liver and brain homogenate increased in a concentration dependent manner, with the enzyme digested tomato fruits and pastes ranking high. Similarly, the ability of the in vitro digested tomato fruit and pastes to enhance activities of the antioxidant enzymes (GPx, GSH, SOD and Catalase) and to inhibit the formation of cholinesterases ranked high. The result of this investigation showed that the studied tomato fruit and pastes possess antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase activities that would be bio-available after the gastrointestinal digestion and by implication could be harnessed as functional food. © 2020 ISEKI-Food Association (IFA).},

abstract={Objective: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an acquired neurological disorder of cognitive and behavioral impairments, with a long and progressive route. Currently, efforts are being made to develop potent drugs that target multiple pathological mechanisms that drive the successful treatment of AD in human beings. The development of nano-drug delivery systems has recently emerged as an effective strategy to treat AD. Methods: In the present study, the protective effect of Phytol and Phytol loaded Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid nanoparticles (Phytol-PLGANPs) were evaluated in Wistar rat scopolamine model of AD. Results and Discussion: The consumption of Phytol and Phytol-PLGANPs significantly ameliorated the cognitive deficits caused by scopolamine on spatial and short term memory. Phytol and Phytol-PLGANPs significantly enhanced the cholinergic effect by inhibiting both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE & BuChE), β-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity, attenuating macromolecular damage, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) level by activating antioxidative defense system (Superoxide dismutase and catalase) and restoring glutathione metabolizing enzyme systems (Glutathione S-transferase) and also regulating the apoptotic mediated cell death. Moreover, in vivo toxicity study suggests that Phytol and Phytol-PLGANPs did not cause any adverse pathological alteration in rats treated with a higher concentration of Phytol-PLGANPs (200 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic study revealed that Phytol-PLGANPs enhanced the biodistribution and sustained the release profile of phytol in the brain and plasma. Conclusion: Overall, the outcome of the study suggests that Phytol and Phytol-PLGANPs act as a potent candidate with better anti-amnesic effects and multi-faceted neuroprotective potential against scopolamine-induced memory dysfunction in Wistar rats. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Objectives: The scope of the present study was to specify the therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases through evaluating cholinesterase and tyrosinase (TYR) inhibitory and antioxidant activity of Lysimachia verticillaris (LV), and to isolate the major compounds considering the most active fraction. Materials and Methods: The methanol extract (ME) of LV and the chloroform, ethyl acetate (EtOAC), and aqueous fractions obtained from it were used for biological activity and isolation studies. The ME and all fractions were tested for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and TYR inhibitory and antioxidant potentials using ELISA microtiter assays. Seven major compounds were isolated from the active EtOAC fraction by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by several spectroscopic methods. Results: Marked AChE inhibitory activity was observed in the EtOAC fraction (6337±1.74%), BChE inhibitory activity in the ME and EtOAC fraction (85.84±3.01% and 83.82±3.93%), total phenol content in the EtOAC fraction (261.59±3.95 mg equivalent of gallic acid/1 g of extract) and total flavonoid contents in the EtOAC fraction (515.54±2.80 mg equivalent of quercetin/1 g of extract), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and ferric-reducing antioxidant power values in the aqueous and EtOAC fractions (92.54±0.67%, 92.11±0.30%; 2.318±0.054, 2.224±0.091, respectively). Accordingly, the isolation studies were carried out on the EtOAC fractions. Compounds 1-7 (gallic acid, (+)-catechin, myricetin 3-O-arabinofuranoside, myricetin 3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-β-glucopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-arabinofuranoside, and quercetin 3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside, respectively) were isolated from the active EtOAC fraction.

abstract={Background: Genetic variants in the BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) gene are associated with reduced BChE enzyme activity and prolonged post-succinylcholine neuromuscular blockade, which can lead to postanesthetic apnea and respiratory depression. Testing for BChE deficiency is usually performed by biochemical methods and is generally only offered to patients who have a personal or family history of prolonged post-succinylcholine neuro-muscular blockade. Purpose: Using a clinical test, we investigated the frequencies of BCHE genotypes that are associated with increased risk for prolonged post-succinylcholine neuromuscular blockade. Materials and Methods: Five BCHE variants, including the A (atypical, rs1799807), K (Kalow, rs1803274), F1 (fluoride-1, rs28933389), F2 (fluoride-2, rs28933390), and S1 (silent-1, rs398124632), were genotyped in a large (n = 13,301), multi-ethnic cohort in the United States. Subjects were recipients of pharmacogenetic testing ordered by their physicians as part of routine care. Results: The minor allele frequencies of A, K, F1, F2, and S1 were 1.60%, 19.93%, 0.08%, 0.47%, and 0.04%, respectively, in this cohort. Based on a review of biochemical and clinical data of these variants, we grouped BCHE genotypes into four phenotypic categories to stratify the risk for prolonged post-succinylcholine neuromuscular blockade. Approximately 0.06% of patients were predicted to have severe BChE deficiency, 8% were predicted to have moderate BChE deficiency, and 29% were predicted to have mild BChE deficiency. Compared to other ethnic groups, Caucasians were predicted to have the highest frequency of BChE deficiency. Conclusion: While severe BChE deficiency is rare in the United States, approximately 8% of Americans are at moderate risk of prolonged post-succinylcholine neuromuscular block-ade, suggesting that a sizable percentage of patients may benefit from preoperative genetic testing of BCHE. © 2020 Zhu et al.},

abstract={The supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of volatile and fixed oil from milled parsley (Petroselinum crispum L.) seeds, using CO2 as solvent, is presented in this study. Extraction experiments were carried out in two steps: at pressures of (90 or 300) bar and temperature of 40 °C. The first extraction step, performed at 90 bar, produced a volatile fraction mainly formed by apiole (82.1%) and myristicin (11.4%). The volatile oil yield was 2.6% by weight of the charge. The second extraction step, carried out at 300 bar produced a fixed oil at a yield of 0.4% by weight. The most represented fatty acids in P. crispum fixed oil were 18:1 n-12 (49.9%), 18:2 n-6 (18.2%), 18:1 n-9 (11.8%), and 16:0 (7.4%). In particular, the unsaturated fatty acids 18:1 n-12 and 18:1 n-9 averaged 182.2 mg/g and 92.1 mg/g of oil extract, respectively. The quality of the oils extracted by SFE, in terms of its chemical composition, was compared to the oils obtained by hydrodistillation (HD) in a Clevenger apparatus and by solvent extraction (SE) using n-hexane in a Soxhlet apparatus. The antioxidant properties were determined by means of the ABTS assay. The results indicated that the fixed oil possessed low antioxidant activity (EC50 = 0.4 mg/mL) and the volatile oil had no antioxidant activity. The total phenolic content, expressed as concentration of gallic acid (gallic acid equivalent, GAE), of the fixed oil was 1.5 mg/g. The fixed oil found to have inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase, the volatile oil is active on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), tyrosinase, and α-glucosidase. Both samples have weak inhibitory activity on α-amylase and no activity on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Dementia is an important issue in western societies, and in the following years, this problem will also rise in the developing regions, such as Africa and Asia. The most common types of dementia in adults are Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD), of which, AD accounts for more than half of the cases. The most prominent symptom of AD is cognitive impairment, currently treated with four drugs: Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, enhancing cholinergic transmission; as well as memantine, protecting neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity. Despite ongoing efforts, no new drugs in the treatment of AD have been registered for the last ten years, thus multiple studies have been conducted on genetic factors affecting the efficacy of antidementia pharmacotherapy. The researchers investigate the effects of variants in multiple genes, such as ABCB1, ACE, CHAT, CHRNA7, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, NR1I2, NR1I3, POR, PPAR, RXR, SLC22A1/2/5, SLC47A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, associated with numerous pathways: the development of pathological proteins, formation and metabolism of acetylcholine, transport, metabolism and excretion of antidementia drugs and transcription factors regulating the expression of genes responsible for metabolism and transport of drugs. The most promising results have been demonstrated for APOE E4, dementia risk variant, BCHE-K, reduced butyrylcholinesterase activity variant, and CYP2D6 UM, ultrarapid hepatic metabolism. Further studies investigate the possibilities of the development of emerging drugs or genetic editing by CRISPR/Cas9 for causative treatment. In conclusion, the pharmacogenetic studies on dementia diseases may improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in some patients with beneficial genetic variants, at the same time, identifying the carriers of unfavorable alleles, the potential group of novel approaches to the treatment and prevention of dementia. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={In current study is done antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes I and II inhibition assays, screening of biological active compounds and electronic microscopy analysis of secretory canals of fruits, flowers, roots, and aerial parts extracts and essential oils of Angelica purpurascens. Phenolic constituents, antioxidant, and anti-lipid peroxidation potentials of variants were estimated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) processes. Cholinesterase inhibition effect was detected through Ellman's method. The GC/ Mass Spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography (GC)-flame Ionization Detector (FID) was used for essential oils analysis. NMR techniques was used for identification of the isolated compounds. The fruit hexane and dichloromethane fractions exhibited a greater antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content. The dichloromethane fraction of fruit demonstrated the most higher acetylcholinesterase inhibition (39.86 ± 2.63%), while the fruit hexane fraction displayed the best inhibition towards butyrylcholinesterase (84.02 ± 1.28%). Cytosolic isoenzymes of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) I, and II isoenzymes were influentially suppressed by flower and fruit dichloromethane fractions with 1.650 and 2.020 µM IC50 values, respectively. The electronic microscopy analysis of secretory canals found that the small number of secretory canals were at leaf while the largest shape of secretory canals was at the fruit. The secretory canals of roots, aerial parts, and fruits include more monoterpene hydrocarbons, while the canals, existing in the flowers are qualified by a higher presence of sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene (12.1%), germacrene D (4.5%) and ether octyl acetate (11.9%). The highest level of monoterpene β-phellandrene (47.6%) and limonene (8.2%) were found in the fruit essential oil. The next isolated compounds from fruits of A. purpurascens like stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, bergapten, and oxypeucedanin have shown high anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) has various applications for die-tetic and medicinal purposes. Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate antioxidant, antiproliferative and anticho-linesterase activities of different extracts from leaf and stem of Pistacia atlantica Desf. Methods: The antioxidant activity was performed by four methods: DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC and reducing power assays. Anti-cholinesterase activity was performed against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymes. Antiproliferative assays were investigated against HeLa cell lines using xCELLigence RTCA instrument. The secondary metabolites composition was established by HPLC-TOF/MS analysis. Results: In DPPH, reducing power and in ABTS.+ scavenging activity, all the extracts showed strong inhibitory activity compared to synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), in which the activities were almost equal to the two standards. The results were less significant in CUPRAC assay. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts exhibited the best antioxidant activity in all tests. Moreover, P. atlantica extracts inhibited AChE and BChE activities in a dose-dependent manner. The strongest AChE and BuChE inhibition activities were obtained for EtOAc extract of the stem (IC50 values 15.14±0.74 and 24.01±0.21 µg/mL, respectively) compared to galantamine (IC50 values 6.27±1.15 and 34.75±1.99 µg/mL, respec-tively). P. atlantica extracts also showed significant antiproleferative activity against HeLa cell lines, the best antiproleferative activity was obtained for the methanol and EtOAc extracts. The ob-served biological activities can be attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the extracts. The HPLC-TOF/MS analysis identified the presence of 22 phytochemicals. Gallic acid and rutin were the main compounds detected. Cichoric, gentisic, vanillic, protocatechuic and rosmarinic acids as well as catechin and quercetin were also present. Conclusion: This study demonstrated good antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antiproliferative activities of P. atlantica extracts, which opens up new possibilities for pharmaceutical and food in-dustries. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background: Pyrazolines, electron-rich nitrogen carriers, are of great importance due to their potential applications for the treatment of many diseases including inflammation, infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Objectives: The purpose of this work was to synthesize new pyrazoline derivatives and evaluate their anticholinesterase effects. Methods: 1-Aryl-5-[4-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl]-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles (1-7) were synthesized via the treatment of 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-[4-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl]prop-2-en-1-one with arylhydrazine hydrochloride derivatives in acetic acid, whereas 1-aryl-5-[4-(morpholin-4-yl)phenyl]-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles (8-14) were obtained by the treatment of 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-[4-(morpholin-4-yl)phenyl]prop-2-en-1-one with arylhydrazine hydrochloride derivatives in acetic acid. Their inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were determined using a modification of Ellman’s spectrophotometric method. In silico docking and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) studies were performed using Schrödinger’s Maestro molecular modeling package. Results: In general, piperidine derivatives were found to be more effective than morpholine derivatives on cholinesterases (ChEs). 1-Phenyl-5-[4-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl]-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphe-nyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole (1) and 1-(4-cyanophenyl)-5-[4-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl]-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole (7) were identified as the most effective AChE inhibitors in this series with 40.92% and 38.98%, respectively. Compounds 1 and 7 were docked into the active site of human AChE (PDB code: 4EY7). Both the compounds were found to be capable of forming π-π stacking interactions with Trp286. Based on in silico ADME studies, these compounds are expected to have reasonable oral bioavailability. Conclusion: In the view of this work, the structural modification of the identified agents is going on for the generation of new anticholinesterase agents with enhanced efficacy. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Phosphazine and phosphazide derivatives are described herein as a new class of selective and potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and β-amyloid aggregation inhibitors. Phosphazines (5–7) were synthesized smoothly via a redox-condensation reaction of 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane with different amines derivatives in the presence of dialkyl azodicarboxylate (Staudinger reaction) while phosphazides (8) via electrophilic attack of azido derivatives. Structures of the synthesized compounds were justified on the basis of compatible elementary and spectroscopic analyses. All the compounds were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. The most three potent compounds (5b-c and 8b) showing AChE IC50 values (29.85–34.96 nM) comparable to that of donepezil (34.42 nM) were subjected to further investigation by testing their butyrylcholinesterase, MMP-2 and self-induced Aβ aggregation inhibition activity. Especially, the coumarin phosphazide derivative (8b) presented the best AChE inhibition selectivity index (IC50 = 34.96 nM, AChE/BuChE; 3.81) together with good inhibition ability against MMP-2 (IC50 = 441.33 nM) and self-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation (IC50 = 337.77 nM). In addition, the inhibition of metal-induced Aβ aggregation by 8b was confirmed by thioflavine T fluorescence. The most potent effect of 8b was observed on the Zn2+-induced Aβ42 aggregation. Kinetic study of compound 8b suggested it to be a competitive AChE inhibitor. Also, it specifically chelates metal and is predicted to be permeable to BBB. It also possesses low toxicity on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with a safety index of 15.37. In addition, it was demonstrated that compound 8b can improve the cognitive impairment of scopolamine-induced model in mice with % alternations and transfer latency time comparable to that of donepezil. Also, a docking study was carried out and it was in accordance with the in vitro results. These promising in vitro and in vivo findings highlight compound 8b as a possible drug candidate in searching for new multifunctional AD drugs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The coastlines of Morocco have an abundant resource of diverse seaweeds but the bioactivity of many of these seaweeds is still unexplored. The aim of this study was to contribute to the evaluation of the antioxidant potential, using different in vitro systems and searching some fingerprints of phenolic constituents based on LC-MS/MS method of five seaweeds species obtained from Moroccan Atlantic Ocean: Bifurcaria bifurcata, Cystoseira humilis, Cystoseira stricta, Fucus spiralis and Gelidium sesquipedale. The total phenolic compounds, the antioxidant activity, anticholinesterase, tyrosinase inhibitory, urease inhibitory activities and the organic compounds were determined. The results showed that Fucus spiralis possessed the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents compared to the others. In addition, Fucus spiralis (IC50: 13.25 ± 0.9 µg/mL) and Cystoseira stricta (IC50: 13.58 ± 1.2 µg/mL) exhibited higher lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity. The highest1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (IC50: 47.23 ± 3.8 µg/mL), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) dia-mmonium salt (ABTS) (IC50: 5.95 ± 0.6 µg/mL), and Cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) (55.24 ± 0.04 µg trolox equivalents/mg) activity was measured in Fucus spiralis. Regarding metal chelating activity, Bifurcaria bifurcata was the best (IC50: 45.22 ± 0.9 µg/mL) compared to the others. The highest acetylcholinesterase (IC50: 28.92 ± 1.8 µg/mL), butyrylcholinesterase (IC50: 11.72 ± 2.8 µg/mL), tyrosinase (IC50: 6.19 ± 0.4 µg/mL) and urease (IC50: 10.96 ± 1.3 µg/mL) inhibitory activities was found in Fucus spiralis. According to LC-MS/MS results, quinic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-OH-benzoic acid, hesperidin, were detected in ethanol extracts of the five Moroccan seaweeds. This study demonstrated that seaweeds, particularly Fucus spiralis and Cystoseira stricta could be a promising source of antioxidants and phytochemicals which can be used in cosmetics, pharmaceutical and as nutritional food supplement in food industries to deleterious free radical induced stress, disorder and diseases. © 2019 SAAB},
