Abstract = {{Neurodegenerative diseases have been characterized by loss of neuron
   structures as well as their functions. This study was designed to assess
   molecular docking of flavonoids from Andrographis paniculata as
   potential acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and monoamine
   oxidase inhibitors in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Eight
   identified possible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase,
   butyrylcholinesterase, and monoamine oxidase from Andrographis
   paniculata were retrieved from the PubChem database. The molecular
   docking, ADMET, and Lipinski's rule of five were examined using
   different bioinformatic tools. It was shown that only rutin has the
   highest binding affinity (-12.6 kcal/mol) than the standard used. ADMET
   results demonstrated that all the eight compounds are druggable
   candidates except rutin. Also, only tangeritin has a blood-brain barrier
   (BBB) permeation potential. Hence, it can be deduced that all flavonoid
   compounds from Andrographis paniculata are orally druggable, which can
   make them useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases better
   than donepezil.}},

Title = {{Volatile and phenolic profiling of a traditional medicinal plant,
   Hypericum empetrifolium with in vitro biological activities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hypericum empetrifolium Willd is a
   member of the Hypericaceae family, mainly known in southern Greece, and
   western Turkey. Being a centuries-old medicinal plant, the aerial parts
   of the plant have been used for the treatment of herpes, kidney stones,
   gastric ulcer, and also for their anti-helminthic, and diuretic purposes
   traditionally.
   Aim of the study: The current study aimed to investigate the
   phytochemical profiles of the essential oil, and two ethanol extracts
   prepared from the aerial parts (H. empetrifolium aerial parts extract
   HEA), and roots of the plant (H. empetrifolium roots extract HER), and
   to provide data on antioxidant, anticholinesterase, antityrosinase,
   antiurease, cytotoxic, and antimicrobial activities of the extracts.
   Materials and methods: In this study, volatile and phenolic compounds of
   the HEA and HER were analyzed by GC MS and LC-MS/MS, respectively.
   Antioxidant potential of the extracts was clarified by using DPPH
   radical scavenging assay, ABTS cation radical assay, and the CUPRAC
   assay. Acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, urease, and
   tyrosinase inhibitory activity assays were used to determine enzyme
   inhibition capacity of the extracts. Cytotoxic activity of the extracts
   was established by using XTT assay. The antimicrobial activity of the
   extracts was determined by the microbroth dilution technique.
   Results: The major compounds of the essential oil were revealed as
   alloaromodendrene (24.7\%), alpha-pinene (14.7\%), beta-pinene (10.7\%),
   and alpha-terpineol (7.7\%) by the GC-MS analysis. According to the
   LC-MS/MS analysis results, quinic acid was the most abundant constituent
   in both extracts with 20612.42 +/- 169.02 mu g/g extract in HEA extract,
   and with 2254.34 +/- 18.49 mu g/g extract in HER extract, respectively.
   The HEA extract was also found to be rich in terms of chlorogenic acid
   (5583.14 +/- 38.52 mu g/g extract), isoquercitrin (3076.77 +/- 40.92 mu
   g/g extract), and malic acid (2822.90 +/- 31.90 mu g/g extract). HEA
   extract exhibited a significant antioxidant effect with an IC50 value of
   11.98 +/- 0.22 mu g/mL according to the DPPH radical scavenging assay.
   Similar results were obtained with the ABTS cation radical assay, and
   the CUPRAC assay. HER extract showed a strong butyrylcholinesterase
   inhibitory effect with 88.69 +/- 0.62\% at 200 mu g/mL concentration.
   Both extracts were considered to have moderate anti-tyrosinase activity
   compared to the standard at 200 mu g/mL. The best antimicrobial activity
   was obtained for HEA against C. parapsilosis with an MIC value of 4.88
   mu g/mL. HEA also exhibited antifungal activity against C. tropicalis
   with 19.53 mu g/mL. Only HER exhibited low cytotoxicity on A498 renal
   cell lines with 60.6\% cell viability.
   Conclusion: Unquestionably, H. empetrifolium Willd has
   ethnopharmacological importance according to these results, and further
   investigations are required to evaluate other therapeutic properties of
   the plant.}},

Abstract = {{Caesalpinia bonduc and C. decapeleta var. japonica have great importance
   in traditional medicine systems but scientific information's are still
   lacking for their potentials. To explore their bioactivity, we assessed
   the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory abilities of the dichloromethane
   (DCM), ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts prepared from the
   leaves and bark. The cytotoxicity and anticancer properties of the
   extracts were also assessed in vitro. The water extract of C. decapeleta
   leaves possessed highest phenolic content (108.16 mg gallic acid
   equivalent (GAE)/g extract), while the highest flavonoid content was
   recorded for the C. bonduc leaf methanolic extract (27.89 mg rutin
   equivalent (RE)/g extract). In general, C decapeleta extracts possessed
   higher radical scavenging potential compared to C. bonduc extracts. C.
   decapeleta DCM leaves extract (10.20 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g
   extract) showed highest inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase. The
   cytotoxicity of the most potent methanolic and aqueous extracts were
   assessed against four cell lines. The chemical profiles of both species
   appeared to be different. C. bonduc was abundant in organic and phenolic
   acids as well as their esters. Flavonoid glycosides, bonducellin and its
   derivatives and caesalminaxins were identified. Whereas, C. decalpetala
   possessed many galloylated compounds. The cytotoxicity of C. bonduc and
   C. decapetala extracts was tested using
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) based
   assay on VERO (kidney of an adult African Green monkey cells), HeLa
   (human cervical adenocarcinoma cells), RKO (human colon carcinoma
   cells), FaDu (human hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma cells) cell lines.
   C. bonduc bark water extract exhibited the highest cytotoxicity towards
   HeLa (50 \% cytotoxic concentration (CC50): 28.5 mu g/mL) cancer cell
   line, as compared to normal VERO cells (CC50 :35.87 mu g/mL). For C.
   decapetala, the highest cytotoxicity was found for bark methanol extract
   on the HeLa cells with CC50 of 46.08 mu g/mL and selectivity index of
   3.33. In the gene ontology analysis, prostate cancer, nuclear factor
   kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling, proteoglycans in cancer pathways might
   support the results of the cytotoxic assays. These results showed that
   the tested Caesalpinia species, showing potent inhibitory action against
   butyrylcholinesterase, might represent novel phytotherapeutic avenues
   for the management of Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, eight new Schiff base derivatives (2a-h) were synthesized
   and their inhibition activities against Acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
   Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), alpha-Glucosidase and Lactoperoxidase
   (LPO) were investigated. Structures of the synthesized compounds were
   characterized using H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
   infrared spectroscopy (IR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
   spectroscopic methods. AChE was inhibited by these novel Schiff bases
   (2a-h) in low nanomolar levels, the K-i of which differed between 592.66
   +/- 57.04 and 810.78 +/- 84.06 nM. Against BChE, the novel compounds
   demonstrated Kis varying from 358.31 +/- 37.88 to 577.24 +/- 59.91 nM.
   Also, these novel Schiff bases effectively inhibited alpha-glucosidase,
   with K-i values in the range of 1.56 +/- 0.32 to 14.78 +/- 2.57 nM. For
   LPO, K-i values were in the range of 3.96 +/- 0.37 to 12.75 +/- 0.06 nM.
   For alpha-glucosidase, the most effective molecules were 2b and 2 g with
   K-i values of 1.56 +/- 0.32 and 14.78 +/- 2.57 nM, respectively.
   Molecular docking results showed that the compounds have binding

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifactorial, progressive
   neurodegeneration with impaired behavioural and cognitive functions. The
   multitarget-directed ligand (MTDL) strategies are promising paradigm in
   drug development, potentially leading to new possible therapy options
   for complex AD. Herein, a series of novel MTDLs
   phenylsulfonyl-pyrimidine carboxylate (BS-1 to BS-24) derivatives were
   designed and synthesized for AD treatment. All the synthesized compounds
   were validated by (HNMR)-H-1, (CNMR)-C-13, HRMS, and BS-19 were
   structurally validated by X-Ray single diffraction analysis. To evaluate
   the plausible binding affinity of designed compounds, molecular docking
   study was performed, and the result revealed their significant
   interaction with active sites of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
   butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The synthesized compounds displayed
   moderate to excellent in vitro enzyme inhibitory activity against AChE
   and BuChE at nanomolar (nM) concentration. Among 24 compounds (BS-1 to
   BS-24), the optimal compounds (BS-10 and BS-22) displayed potential
   inhibition against AChE; IC50 = 47.33 +/- 0.02 nM and 51.36 +/- 0.04 nM
   and moderate inhibition against BuChE; IC50 = 159.43 +/- 0.72 nM and
   153.3 +/- 0.74 nM respectively. In the enzyme kinetics study, the
   compound BS-10 displayed non-competitive inhibition of AChE with Ki = 8
   nM. Respective compounds BS-10 and BS-22 inhibited AChE-induced A
   beta(1- 42) aggregation in thioflavin T-assay at 10 mu M and 20 mu M,
   but BS-10 at 10 mu M and 20 mu M concentrations are found more potent
   than BS-22. In addition, the aggregation properties were determined by
   the dynamic light scattering (DLS) and was found that BS-10 and BS-22
   could significantly inhibit self-induced as well as AChE-induced A
   beta(1- 42) aggregation. The effect of compounds (BS-10 and BS-22) on
   the viability of MC65 neuroblastoma cells and their capability to cross
   the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in PAMPA-BBB were further studied.
   Further, in silico approach was applied to analyze physicochemical and
   pharmacokinetics properties of the designed compounds via the SwissADME
   and PreADMET server. Hence, the novel phenylsulfonyl-pyrimidine
   carboxylate derivatives can act as promising leads in the development of
   AChE inhibitors and A beta disaggregator for the treatment of AD. (C)

Abstract = {{In the last years, in order to achieve a better treatment of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), much focus has been put on the development of
   cholinesterase (Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase)
   inhibitor drugs. Thus, the aim of this study is to discover promising
   active compounds for Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase
   enzymes inhibitors based on QSAR model and drug-likeness evaluation. In
   this study, a series of DL0410 and its 50 derivatives are accounted for
   the set up of two QSAR models. This allows an exploration of the main
   molecular descriptors that control the inhibitory activity of specific
   compounds towards cholinesterase enzymes: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
   and Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Simultanerously, the models can help
   to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds within its
   applicability domain. A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis is
   carried out to derive QSAR models. The results indicate that the QSAR
   models of Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory
   activity are robust and have a very good prediction capacity, testified
   by values of R-2 equal to 0.935 and 0.895, respectively. The analysis
   carried out by adopting the QSAR models succeed in screening 15
   potential compounds with higher biological activity. Subsequently, the
   investigated compounds has been subjected to the drug-likeness
   evaluation and reactivity study. The results show that most of the
   compounds do not present any bioavailability problem when administered
   orally. The results also allow determining the compounds that have not
   clearance problems, those that are the most stable and the most reactive
   among those tested. These findings indicate that the newly designed
   candidate drugs have promising potential toward AChE and BuChE enzyme
   inhibition and should be experimentally investigated. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Abstract = {{New compounds containing indanone and carbamate moieties were designed
   based on the hybrid pharmacophore approach. The designed compounds were
   synthesized and fully characterized by using different methods such as
   IR, Mass, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and HPTLC. In vitro inhibitory activities
   of all synthe-sized compounds were evaluated against
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The
   compound 3-{[}(5,6-dimethoxy-1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl) methyl]
   phenyl (4-methoxyphenyl) carbamate (4h) showed the best inhibitory
   activities with IC50 values of 1.20 and 0.30 mu M against AChE and BChE,
   respectively. In addition, this compound showed a beta-amyloid
   self-aggregation inhibitory effect (86.8\%), stronger than that of
   donepezil (45.5\%). Moreover, significant neuroprotective activity on
   PC12 cells against H2O2 induced cell death was demonstrated for compound
   4h at 10 and 100 mu M concentrations. Kinetic studies using the 4h
   confirmed a partial non-competitive mixed type of inhibition mechanism
   on both enzymes. Considering the suggested inhibition mechanism,
   molecular docking was used to predict the possible allosteric binding
   mode of 4h with both AChE and BChE enzymes. The presented

Abstract = {{Twelve carbazole-coumarin hybrids were synthesized and biologically
   evaluated as dual binding site acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The
   structures of the carbazole-coumarin hybrids were confirmed by IR, NMR,
   HRMS and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The compound 3j had
   the crystal system of triclinic and the space group of P-1. The
   cholinesterase inhibitory activity of synthesized compounds was measured
   using colorimetric Ellman's method. Compound 3h exhibited good
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 6.72 mu
   M) and a high selectivity over butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Compound
   3k showed the best BuChE inhibitory activity with the IC50 of 0.50 mu M.
   The SAR studies revealed that the linker length played a crucial role in
   determining AChE inhibitory activity and the structure of the coumarin
   moieties affected the BuChE-inhibition activities of the hybrids.
   Molecular docking study of compound 3h indicated that it interacts with
   the crucial amino acids present at the catalytic active site and
   peripheral anionic site of AChE. Compound 3h would be a promising drug
   candidate to treat AD as a selective and dual binding site inhibitor of
   AChE. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of novel C4-C7-tethered biscoumarin derivatives (12a-e) linked
   through piperazine moiety was designed, synthesized, and evaluated
   biological/therapeutic potential. Biscoumarin 12d was found to be the
   most effective inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE, IC50 = 6.30
   mu M) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, IC50 = 49 mu M). Detailed
   molecular modelling studies compared the accommodation of ensaculin
   (well-established coumarin derivative tested in phase I of clinical
   trials) and 12d in the human recombinant AChE (hAChE) active site. The
   ability of novel compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was
   predicted with a positive outcome for compound 12e. The
   antiproliferative effects of newly synthesized biscoumarin derivatives
   were tested in vitro on human lung carcinoma cell line (A549) and normal
   colon fibroblast cell line (CCD-18Co). The effect of derivatives on cell
   proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, quantification of cell numbers
   and viability, colony-forming assay, analysis of cell cycle distribution
   and mitotic activity. Intracellular localization of used derivatives in
   A549 cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Derivatives 12d and 12e
   showed significant antiproliferative activity in A549 cancer cells
   without a significant effect on normal CCD-18Co cells. The inhibition of
   hAChE/human recombinant BChE (hBChE), the antiproliferative activity on
   cancer cells, and the ability to cross the BBB suggest the high
   potential of biscoumarin derivatives. Beside the treatment of cancer,
   12e might be applicable against disorders such as schizophrenia, and 12d
   could serve future development as therapeutic agents in the prevention
   and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease.}},

Abstract = {{The present study demonstrates a simple approach to enhancing thermal
   stability of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by using natural polymers.
   Analysis of thermal inactivation of the tetrameric BChE in starch and
   gelatin gels at 50-64 degrees C showed that thermal inactivation
   followed second-order kinetics and involved two alternating processes of
   BChE inactivation, which occurred at different rates (fast and slow
   processes). The activation enthalpy Delta H-\# and the activation
   entropy Delta S-\# for BChE in starch and gelatin gels were evaluated.
   The values of Delta H-\# for the fast and the slow thermal inactivation
   of BChE in starch gel were 61 +/- 3, and 22 +/- 2 kcal/mol,
   respectively, and the values of Delta S-\# were 136 +/- 12 and -2.03 +/-
   0.05 cal center dot K-1 center dot mol(-1), respectively. Likewise, the
   values of Delta H-\# for BChE in gelatin gel were 58 +/- 6 and 109 +/-
   11 kcal/mol, and the values of Delta S-\# were 149 +/- 16 and 262 +/- 21
   cal center dot K-1 center dot mol(-1), respectively. The values of the
   activation parameters obtained in this study suggest that starch gel
   produced a stronger stabilizing effect on BChE exposed to elevated
   temperatures over long periods compared with gelatin gel.}},

Abstract = {{Neurodegenerative diseases, for example Alzheimer's, are perceived as
   driven by hereditary, cellular, and multifaceted biochemical actions.
   Numerous plant products, for example flavonoids, are documented in
   studies for having the ability to pass the blood-brain barrier and
   moderate the development of such illnesses. Computer-aided drug design
   (CADD) has achieved importance in the drug discovery world; innovative
   developments in the aspects of structure identification and
   characterization, bio-computational science, and molecular biology have
   added to the preparation of new medications towards these ailments. In
   this study we evaluated nine flavonoid compounds identified from three
   medicinal plants, namely T. diversifolia, B. sapida, and I. gabonensis
   for their inhibitory role on acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, using
   pharmacophore modeling, auto-QSAR prediction, and molecular studies, in
   comparison with standard drugs. The results indicated that the
   pharmacophore models produced from structures of AChE, BChE and MAO
   could identify the active compounds, with a recuperation rate of the
   actives found near 100\% in the complete ranked decoy database. Moreso,
   the robustness of the virtual screening method was accessed by
   well-established methods including enrichment factor (EF), receiver
   operating characteristic curve (ROC), Boltzmann-enhanced discrimination
   of receiver operating characteristic (BEDROC), and area under
   accumulation curve (AUAC). Most notably, the compounds' pIC(50) values
   were predicted by a machine learning-based model generated by the
   AutoQSAR algorithm. The generated model was validated to affirm its
   predictive model. The best models achieved for AChE, BChE and MAO were
   models kpls\_radial\_17 (R-2 = 0.86 and Q(2) = 0.73), pls\_38 (R-2 =
   0.77 and Q(2) = 0.72), kpls\_desc\_44 (R-2 = 0.81 and Q(2) = 0.81) and
   these externally validated models were utilized to predict the
   bioactivities of the lead compounds. The binding affinity results of the
   ligands against the three selected targets revealed that luteolin
   displayed the highest affinity score of -9.60 kcal/mol, closely followed
   by apigenin and ellagic acid with docking scores of -9.60 and -9.53
   kcal/mol, respectively. The least binding affinity was attained by
   gallic acid (-6.30 kcal/mol). The docking scores of our standards were
   -10.40 and -7.93 kcal/mol for donepezil and galanthamine, respectively.
   The toxicity prediction revealed that none of the flavonoids presented
   toxicity and they all had good absorption parameters for the analyzed
   targets. Hence, these compounds can be considered as likely leads for
   drug improvement against the same.}},

Abstract = {{In the study, two novel compounds along with two new compounds were
   isolated from Grewia optiva. The novel compounds have never been
   reported in any plant source, whereas the new compounds are reported for
   the first time from the studied plant. The four compounds were
   characterized as:
   5,5,7,7,11,13-hexamethyl-2-(5-methylhexyl)icosahydro-1H-cyclopenta{[}a]c
   hrysen-9-ol (IX), docosanoic acid (X), methanetriol mano formate (XI)
   and 2,2'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-methylbutanoic acid (XII). The
   anticholinesterase, antidiabetic, and antioxidant potentials of these
   compounds were determined using standard protocols. All the isolated
   compounds exhibited a moderate-to-good degree of activity against
   acetylcholinesterases (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). However,
   compound XII was particularly effective with IC50 of 55 mu g/mL (against
   AChE) and 60 mu g/mL (against BChE), and this inhibitory activity is
   supported by in silico docking studies. The same compound was also
   effective against DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2
   `-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals with IC50
   values of 60 and 62 mu g/mL, respectively. The compound also
   significantly inhibited the activities of alpha-amylase and
   alpha-glucosidase in vitro. The IC50 values for inhibition of the two
   enzymes were recorded as 90 and 92 mu g/mL, respectively. The in vitro
   potentials of compound XII to treat Alzheimer's disease (in terms of
   AchE and BChE inhibition), diabetes (in terms of alpha-amylase and
   alpha-glucosidase inhibition), and oxidative stress (in terms of free
   radical scavenging) suggest further in vivo investigations of the
   compound for assessing its efficacy, safety profile, and other
   parameters to proclaim the compound as a potential drug candidate.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Although carbon nanotubes' (CNTs) toxicity in different experimental
   systems (in vivo and in vitro) is known, little is known about the toxic
   effects of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on aquatic vertebrates. We herein
   investigated the potential impact of CNFs (1 and 10 mg/L) by using
   Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles as experimental model. CNFs were able to
   induce nutritional deficit in animals after 48-h exposure to them, and
   this finding was inferred by reductions observed in body concentrations
   of total soluble carbohydrates, total proteins, and triglycerides. The
   increased production of hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species and
   thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in tadpoles exposed to CNFs has
   suggested REDOX homeostasis change into oxidative stress. This process
   was correlated to the largest number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in
   the blood of these animals. On the other hand, the increased superoxide
   dismutase and catalase activity has suggested that the antioxidant
   system of animals exposed to CNFs was not enough to maintain REDOX
   balance. In addition, CNFs induced increase in acetylcholinesterase and
   butyrylcholinesterase activity, as well as changes in the number of
   neuromasts evaluated on body surface (which is indicative of the
   neurotoxic effect of nanomaterials on the assessed model system). To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the impact of CNFs on
   amphibians; therefore, it broadened our understanding about
   ecotoxicological risks associated with their dispersion in freshwater
   ecosystems and possible contribution to the decline in the populations
   of anurofauna species.}},

Abstract = {{A library of novel 4-\{{[}(benzyloxy)carbonyl]amino\}-2-hydroxybenzoic
   acid amides was designed and synthesized in order to provide potential
   acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE/BChE) inhibitors; the in vitro
   inhibitory profile and selectivity index were specified.
   Benzyl(3-hydroxy-4-\{{[}2-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]carbamoyl\}phenyl)car
   bamate was the best AChE inhibitor with the inhibitory concentration of
   IC50 = 36.05 mu M in the series, while
   benzyl\{3-hydroxy-4-{[}(2-methoxyphenyl)carbamoyl]phenyl\}-carbamate was
   the most potent BChE inhibitor (IC50 = 22.23 mu M) with the highest
   selectivity for BChE (SI = 2.26). The cytotoxic effect was evaluated in
   vitro for promising AChE/BChE inhibitors. The newly synthesized adducts
   were subjected to the quantitative shape comparison with the generation
   of an averaged pharmacophore pattern. Noticeably, three pairs of fairly
   similar fluorine/bromine-containing compounds can potentially form the
   activity cliff that is manifested formally by high structure-activity
   landscape index (SALI) numerical values. The molecular docking study was
   conducted for the most potent AChE/BChE inhibitors, indicating that the
   hydrophobic interactions were overwhelmingly generated with Gln119,
   Asp70, Pro285, Thr120, and Trp82 aminoacid residues, while the hydrogen
   bond (HB)-donor ones were dominated with Thr120. pi-stacking
   interactions were specified with the Trp82 aminoacid residue of chain A
   as well. Finally, the stability of chosen liganded enzymatic systems was
   assessed using the molecular dynamic simulations. An attempt was made to
   explain the noted differences of the selectivity index for the most
   potent molecules, especially those bearing unsubstituted and fluorinated
   methoxy group.}},

Abstract = {{Organophosphate nerve agents (OPNAs) are one of the most lethal forms of
   chemical warfare. After exposure to OPNAs, a patient is given
   life-saving therapeutics, such as atropine and oxime. However, these
   drugs are limited, and the patient can still suffer from irreparable
   injuries. Given the toxicity of OPNAs, access to a prophylactic is
   vital. We have created an enhanced delivery system for prophylactic
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by engineering this biotherapeutic to the
   red blood cell (RBC) surface. In three simple steps that first
   pre-modifies BChE with a cell-reactive polymer, primes the cells for
   engineering, and then grafts the conjugates to the cells, we attached
   over 2 million BChE molecules to a single RBC while retaining the
   enzyme?s activity and enhancing its stability.
   Biotherapeutics have achieved global economic success due to their high
   specificity towards their drug targets, providing exceptional safety and
   efficiency. The ongoing shift away from small molecule drugs towards
   biotherapeutics heightens the need to further improve the
   pharmacokinetics of these biological drugs. Three pervasive obstacles
   that limit the therapeutic capacity of biotherapeutics are proteolytic
   degradation, circulating half-life, and the development of anti-drug
   antibodies. These challenges can culminate in limited efficiency and
   consequently warrant the need for higher drug doses and more frequent
   administration. We have explored the coupling of biotherapeutics to
   long-lived and biocompatible red blood cells (RBCs) to address limited
   pharmacokinetics. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), for example, provides
   prophylactic protection against organophosphate nerve agents (OPNAs),
   yet the short circulation life of the drug requires extraordinary doses.
   Herein, we report the rapid and tunable chemical engineering of BChE to
   RBC membranes to create a cell-based delivery system that retains the
   enzyme activity and enhances stability. In a three-step process that
   first pre-modifies BChE with a cell-reactive polymer chain, primes the
   cells for engineering, and then grafts the conjugates to the cells, we
   attached over 2 million BChE molecules to the surface of each RBC
   without diminishing the bioscavenging capacity of the enzyme.
   Critically, this membrane-engineering approach was cell-tolerated with
   minimal hemolysis observed. These results provide strong evidence for
   the ability of engineered RBCs to serve as an enhanced biotherapeutic
   delivery vehicle.

Abstract = {{The members of the genus Inula have been widely used in traditional
   medicinal. In the present study, 11 Inula species were investigated for
   their phytochemical composition, antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory
   effects. While quinic acid was the principal compound in I. anatolica,
   I. britannica, I. inuloides, I. oculus-christi, I. peacockiana, I.
   sechmenii, I. thapsoides and I. viscidula extracts (22.43?42.02 mg/g dry
   extract (DE)), I. aucheriana and I. discoidea extracts contained rutin
   as their most abundant compound (23.28 and 79.10 mg/g extract,
   respectively). Interestingly, all the Inula extracts were active
   inhibitors of the five key clinical enzymes (acetylcholinesterase
   (3.56?5.13 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g), butyrylcholinesterase
   (1.49?7.34 mg GALAE/g), tyrosinase (112.31?122.13 mg kojic acid

Abstract = {{The interaction of copper(II) with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
   drug sodium meclofenamate (Na-mclf) in the presence or absence of the
   nitrogen-donor co-ligands pyridine (py) or 2,2'-bipyridylamine (bipyam),

   0.5MeOH (2 center dot H2O center dot 0.5MeOH) and
   {[}Cu(mclf-O,O')(2)(bipyam)] (3). The characterization of the complexes
   was achieved by various techniques, including single-crystal X-ray
   crystallography. In order to study the binding mode and strength of the
   complexes to calf-thymus (CT) DNA, various techniques were employed
   which suggested intercalation between the DNA-bases as the most possible
   interaction mode. Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (EB)
   revealed the ability of the complexes to displace the EB from the EB-DNA
   adduct, verifying the intercalative binding mode. The affinity of the
   complexes to bovine and human serum albumin proteins (SAs) was
   investigated by fluorescence emission spectroscopy and the corresponding
   binding constants bear relatively high values, showing that the
   complexes bind tightly and possibly reversibly to SAs. The antioxidant
   activity of the complexes against 1,1-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
   2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radicals
   and the ability to reduce H2O2 proved to be of significant magnitude.
   The in vitro inhibitory activity against the enzymes
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) was
   evaluated, in order to assess the anticholinergic ability of the
   complexes, which appeared promising.}},

Abstract = {{Oxime reactivators of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) represent an integral
   part of standard antidote treatment of organophosphate poisoning. Oxime
   K869 is a novel bisquaternary non-symmetric pyridinium aldoxime with two
   pyridinium rings connected by a tetramethylene bridge where two
   chlorines modify the pyridinium ring bearing the oxime moiety. Based on
   in vitro assays, K869 is a potent AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)
   reactivator. For the investigation of the basic pharmacokinetic
   properties of K869 after its intramuscular application, new HPLC-UV and
   LC-MS/MS methods were developed and validated for its determination in
   rat body fluids and tissues. In this study, the SPE procedure for sample
   pretreatment was optimized as an alternative to routine protein
   precipitation widely used in oxime pharmacokinetics studies.
   K869 oxime is quickly absorbed into the central compartment reaching its
   maximum in plasma (39 +/- 4 mu g/mL) between 15 and 20 min. The majority
   of K869 was eliminated by kidneys via urine when compared with biliary
   excretion. However, only a limited amount of K869 (65 +/- 4 ng/g of
   brain tissue) was found in the brain 30 min after oxime administration.
   Regarding the brain/plasma ratio calculated (less than 1\%), the
   penetration of K869 into the brain did not exceed conventionally used
   oximes. (C) 2021 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by

Title = {{Effects of low-level imidacloprid oral exposure on cholinesterase

Abstract = {{Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide that acts selectively as an
   agonist on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is used for crop
   protection worldwide, as well as for non-agricultural uses. Imidacloprid
   systemic accumulation in food is an important source of imidacloprid
   exposure. Due to the undisputable need for investigations of
   imidacloprid toxicity in non-target species, we evaluated the effects of
   a 28-day oral exposure to low doses of imidacloprid (0.06 mg/kg b.
   w./day, 0.8 mg/kg b. w./day and 2.25 mg/kg b. w./day) on cholinesterase
   activity, oxidative stress responses and primary DNA damage in the blood
   and brain tissue of male Wistar rats. Exposure to imidacloprid did not
   cause significant changes in total cholinesterase, acetylcholinesterase
   and butyrylcholinesterase activities in plasma and brain tissue.
   Reactive oxygen species levels and lipid peroxidation increased
   significantly in the plasma of rats treated with the lowest dose of
   imidacloprid. Activities of glutathione-peroxidase in plasma and brain
   and superoxide dismutase in erythrocytes increased significantly at the
   highest applied dose. High performance liquid chromatography with UV
   diode array detector revealed the presence of imidacloprid in the plasma
   of all the treated animals and in the brain of the animals treated with
   the two higher doses. The alkaline comet assay results showed
   significant peripheral blood leukocyte damage at the lowest dose of
   imidacloprid and dose-dependent brain cell DNA damage. Oral 28-day
   exposure to low doses of imidacloprid in rats resulted in detectable
   levels of imidacloprid in plasma and brain tissue that directly induced
   DNA damage, particularly in brain tissue, with slight changes in plasma
   oxidative stress parameters.}},

Title = {{In vitro age-related differences in rats to organophosphates}},
Journal = {{TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{72}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of toxic action for organophosphates (OPs) is the
   persistent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) resulting in
   accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent hyperstimulation of the
   nervous system. Organophosphates display a wide range of acute
   toxicities. Differences in the OP's chemistries results in differences
   in the compound's metabolism and toxicity. Acute toxicities of OPs
   appear to be principally dependent on compound specific efficiencies of
   detoxication, and less dependent upon efficiencies of bioactivation and
   sensitivity of AChE. Serine esterases, such as carboxylesterase (CaE)
   and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), play a prominent role in OP
   detoxication. Organophosphates can stoichiometrically inhibit these
   enzymes, removing OPs from circulation thus providing protection for the
   target enzyme, AChE. This in vitro study investigated age related
   sensitivity of AChE, BChE and CaE to twelve structurally different OPs
   in rat tissues. Sensitivity of esterases to these OPs was assessed by
   inhibitory concentration 50s (IC(50)s). The OPs displayed a wide range
   of inhibitory potency toward AChE with IC(50)s in the low nM-mu M range
   with no differences among ages; however, the CaE IC(50)s generally
   increased with age reflecting greater protection in adults. These
   results suggest age related differences in acute toxicities of OPs in
   mammals are primarily a result of their detoxication capacities.}},

Journal = {{COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY \& PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Specimens of two endemic cyprinids, Squalius laietanus (Catalan chub)
   and Barbus meridionalis (Mediterranean barbel), were sampled from a
   reference site in a small stream of the Ripoll River (NW Mediterranean)
   outside of their reproductive season. Biomarkers involved in
   xenobiotic-mediated responses were individually contrasted in fish of
   both species and 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) analysed in muscle
   to reveal bioaccumulation trends. The parameters were in muscle:
   cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate
   synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD
   and BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST),
   glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase
   (CAT). All markers are considered adaptive defence mechanism to face
   stress. Sensitivity to a model pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted
   in vitro in muscular acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to
   reveal species sensitivity to neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities
   related to protective mechanisms such as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE),
   CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the antioxidant defences GR and
   GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher in barbel while
   anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ between the
   two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS were
   higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests
   revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub
   (lower IC50) which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic
   efficiency of CE. All these former biochemical particularities are
   discussed in terms of fish ecological performance in front of
   anthropogenic stressors.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an obstinate and progressive
   neurodegenerative disorder, mainly characterized by cognitive decline.
   Increasing number of AD patients and the lack of promising treatment
   strategies demands novel therapeutic agents to combat various disease
   pathologies in AD. Recent progresses in understanding molecular
   mechanisms in AD helped researchers to streamline the various
   therapeutic approaches. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity
   has emerged as one of the potential treatment strategies. The present
   study discusses the identification of two potent AChE inhibitors
   (ZINC11709541 and ZINC11996936) from ZINC database through conventional
   in silico approaches and their in vitro validations. These inhibitors
   have strong preferences towards AChE than butyryicholinesterase (BChE)
   and didn't evoke any significant reduction in the cell viability of
   HEK-293 cells and primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, promising
   neuroprotective properties has also been displayed against glutamate
   induced excitotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. The present study
   proposes two potential drug lead compounds for the treatment of AD, that
   can be used for further studies and preclinical evaluation. (C) 2021

Abstract = {{Stabilization of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase by the
   divalent cations Ca+2, Mg+2, and Mn+2 was investigated. All three
   substantially protect the enzyme from thermal inactivation. Electron
   paramagnetic resonance revealed one high-affinity binding site for Mn+2
   and several much weaker sites. Differential scanning calorimetry showed
   a single irreversible thermal transition. All three cations raise both
   the temperature of the transition and the activation energy, with the
   transition becoming more cooperative. The crystal structures of the Ca+2
   and Mg+2 complexes with Torpedo acetylcholinesterase were solved. A
   principal binding site was identified. In both cases, it consists of
   four aspartates (a 4D motif), within which the divalent ion is embedded,
   together with several water molecules. It makes direct contact with two
   of the aspartates, and indirect contact, via waters, with the other two.
   The 4D motif has been identified in 31 acetylcholinesterase sequences
   and 28 butyrylcholinesterase sequences. Zebrafish acetylcholinesterase
   also contains the 4D motif; it, too, is stabilized by divalent metal
   ions. The ASSAM server retrieved 200 other proteins that display the 4D
   motif, in many of which it is occupied by a divalent cation. It is a
   very versatile motif, since, even though tightly conserved in terms of
   RMSD values, it can contain from one to as many as three divalent metal
   ions, together with a variable number of waters. This novel motif, which
   binds primarily divalent metal ions, is shared by a broad repertoire of
   proteins. An animated Interactive 3D Complement (I3DC) is available in

Abstract = {{Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an essential human cholinesterase
   relevant to liver conditions and neurodegenerative diseases, which makes
   it a pivotal biomarker of health. It therefore remains challenging and
   highly desired to elaborate efficient chemical tools for BChE with
   simple operations and satisfactory working performance. In this work, a
   background-free detection strategy was built by virtue of the judicious
   coupling of a specific BChE-enzymatic reaction and in situ cyclization.
   High sensitivity with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.075 mu g/mL
   could be readily achieved from the blank background and the as-produced
   emissive indicators, and the specific reaction site contributed to the
   high selectivity over other bio-species even acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE). In addition to the multifaceted spectral experiments to verify
   the sensing mechanism, this work assumed comprehensive studies on the
   application. The bio-investigation ranged from cells to an organism,
   declaring a noteworthy prospect in disease diagnosis, especially for
   Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common neurodegenerative disease with
   over-expressed BChE. Moreover, its excellent work for inhibition
   efficacy elucidation was also proved with the accuracy IC50 of tacrine
   for BChE (8.6 nM), giving rise to an expanded application for trace

Abstract = {{Cholinergic system dysfunction, oxidative damage, and alterations in ion
   pump activity have been associated with memory loss and cognitive
   deficits in Alzheimer's disease. 1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones have emerged as
   a class of compounds with potential therapeutic effects due to their
   potent anticholinesterase activity. Accordingly, this study investigated
   the effect of the
   2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-3-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl)thiazolidin-4-one
   (DS12) compound on memory, cholinergic and oxidative stress parameters,
   ion pump activity, and serum biochemical markers in a
   scopolamine-induced memory deficit model. Male Wistar rats were divided
   into four groups: I-Control; II-Scopolamine; III-DS12 (5 mg/kg) +
   scopolamine; and IV-DS12 (10 mg/kg) + scopolamine. The animals from
   groups III and IV received DS12 diluted in canola oil and administered
   for 7 days by gavage. On the last day of treatment, scopolamine (1
   mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30 min after training
   in an inhibitory avoidance apparatus. Twenty-four hours after
   scopolamine administration, the animals were subjected to an inhibitory
   avoidance test and were thereafter euthanized. Scopolamine induced
   memory deficits, increased acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative
   damage, and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex and
   hippocampus. Pretreatment with DS12 prevented these brain alterations.
   Scopolamine also induced an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity in
   lymphocytes and whereas butyrylcholinesterase in serum and treatment
   with DS12 prevented these changes. In animals treated with DS12, no
   changes were observed in renal and hepatic parameters when compared to
   the control group. In conclusion, DS12 emerged as an important
   multitarget compound capable of preventing neurochemical changes
   associated with memory deficits.

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to evaluate the renal function of
   rural workers in a city of northeastern Brazil. A cross-sectional study
   was carried out with 208 workers in Boquim, Sergipe, Brazil. Renal
   function markers and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were evaluated and the
   glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined. The sample consisted
   mainly of illiterate males with a low usage of personal protective
   equipment and no training. Approximately 40\% had some level of renal
   failure. Relative risk (1.59) of GFR alteration was higher in workers
   with more than 5 yr of exposure, mainly to organophosphates. Workers
   more than 60 yr of age presented a 17.06 greater risk for manifesting
   acute intoxication. Butyrylcholinesterase reduction was associated with
   reports of intoxication (relative risk of 11.36). We concluded that
   exposure to pesticides represented a risk factor for the development of
   nephrotoxic effects and alteration of renal function, which reinforced
   the need to implement measures to protect rural workers. Environ Toxicol

Title = {{Discovery, biological evaluation and molecular dynamic simulations of
   butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors through structure-based pharmacophore
   virtual screening}},
Journal = {{FUTURE MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a crucial therapeutic target
   because it is associated with multiple pathological elements of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). An integrated computational strategy was
   employed to exploit effective BChE inhibitors. Methods \& results: Ten
   compounds derived from the Enamine database by structure-based
   pharmacophore virtual screening were further evaluated for biological
   activity; out of the ten, only five had an IC50 of less than 100 mu M.
   Among these five compounds, a new molecule, 970180, presented the most
   potency against BChE, with an IC50 of 4.24 +/- 0.16 mu M, and acted as a
   mixed-type inhibitor. Molecular dynamic simulations and absorption,
   distribution, metabolism and excretion prediction further confirmed its
   high potential as a good candidate of BChE inhibitor. Furthermore,
   cytotoxicity of molecule 970180 was not observed at concentrations up to
   50 mu M, and the molecule also showed a prominent neuroprotective effect
   compared with tacrine at 25 and 50 mu M. Conclusion: This study provides
   an effective structure-based pharmacophore virtual screening method to
   discover BChE inhibitors and provide new choices for the development of
   BChE inhibitors, which may be beneficial for AD patients.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of novel sulfonamides with anti-Alzheimer and antioxidant
   capacities}},
Journal = {{ARCHIV DER PHARMAZIE}},
Abstract = {{A series of novel dopamine analogs incorporating urea and sulfonamide
   functional groups was synthesized from 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine. The
   reaction of 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine with N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl
   chloride, followed by the sulfonyl chlorination of the urea derivative,
   gave benzene-1-sulfonyl chloride 9, which was reacted with NH3 (aq) or
   N-alkyl amines to give related sulfonamides. The O-demethylation
   reaction of the subsequent compounds with BBr3 afforded four novel
   phenolic dopamine analogs including sulfonamide and urea in the same
   structure. The anticholinergic and antioxidant effects of the
   synthesized compounds were examined. Compound 13 exhibited inhibition at
   the micromolar level for both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The IC50 value of 13 was calculated as 298
   +/- 43 mu M for AChE and 321 +/- 29 mu M for BChE. The antioxidant and
   antiradical effects of the molecules were investigated by five different
   methods. Among the synthesized compounds 10-18, the best antioxidant and
   antiradical activities belong to the phenolic compounds 15-18. Compounds
   16 and 18 have a higher reducing power than the standards used, that is,
   butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, Trolox, and
   alpha-tocopherol, for Fe3+-Fe2+ and Cu2+-Cu+ reducing activities. For
   the DPPH center dot radical scavenging method, compounds 16-18 have a
   much better scavenging power than the standard molecules. In addition,
   it has been determined by the induced-fit docking method that compound
   13 is well-fitted in the active site of the enzymes. ADME studies reveal
   that the pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties of all
   synthesized compounds are within an acceptable range.}},

Abstract = {{Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. is extensively used in traditional medicinal
   systems by various cultures. Despite its frequent use in traditional
   medicine, there is still a paucity of scientific information on T.
   asiatica growing on the tropical island of Mauritius. Therefore, the
   present study was designed to appraise the pharmacological and
   phytochemical profile of extracts (methanol, ethyl acetate and water)
   and essential oil obtained from aerial parts of T. asiatica. Biological
   investigation involved the evaluation of in vitro antioxidant and enzyme
   inhibitory potentials. The chemical profile of the EO was determined
   using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis,
   while for the extracts, the total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid content
   were quantified as well as their individual phenolic compounds by
   LC/MS/MS. Quinic acid, fumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, quercitrin and
   isoquercitrin were the main compounds in the extracts. Highest total
   phenolic (82.5 +/- 0.94 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE/g)) and flavonoid
   (43.8 +/- 0.31 mg rutin equivalent (RE/g)) content were observed for the
   methanol extract. The GC/MS analysis has shown the presence of 26
   compounds with linalool (30.9 \%), linalyl acetate (20.9 \%) and
   beta-phellandrene (7.9 \%) being most abundant components in the EO. The
   extracts and EO showed notable antioxidant properties, with the methanol
   extract proved to be superior source of antioxidant compounds.
   Noteworthy anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
   anti-butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) effects were recorded for the tested
   samples, while only the methanol and ethyl acetate extracts were active
   against tyrosinase. With respect to antidiabetic effects, the extracts
   and EO were potent inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase, while modest
   activity was recorded against alpha-amylase. Docking results showed that
   linalyl acetate has the highest affinity to interact with the active
   site of BChE with docking score of -6.25 kcal/mol. The findings amassed
   herein act as a stimulus for further investigations of this plant as a
   potential source of bioactive compounds which can be exploited as
   phyto-therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, six new benzimidazole-functionalized Pd-based complexes bearing
   N-propylphthalimide group were synthesized. These new PEPPSI type of
   Pd(II)NHC complexes (PEPPSI: Pyridine Enhanced Precatalyst Preparation,

   substituted benzimidazolium salts, palladium chloride (PdCl2) and
   3-chloropyridine. The structures of all (NHC)PdX2(3-chloropyridine)
   complexes have been clearly characterized by using NMR (H-1 and C-13),
   FTIR spectroscopic method, and elemental analysis techniques. Also, the
   structures of three of the (NHC)PdX2(3-chloropyridine) complexes were
   confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Also, novel
   N-propylphthalimide-substituted (NHC)PdX 2 (3-chloropyridine) complexes
   effectively inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE), with Ki values in the
   range of 0.54 +/- 0.10 to 3.01 +/- 0.63 mu M. For butyryl-cholinesterase
   (BChE) was obtained with Ki values in the range of 0.82 +/- 0.11 to 5.03
   +/- 0.86 mu M. For alpha-glycosidase (alpha-Gly) the most effective Ki
   values of 1c, 1d, and 1b were with Ki values of 23.83 +/- 5.98, 26.04

   activities, and molecular docking studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR TOXICOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In this study, preparation, as well as investigation of
   alpha-glycosidase and cholinesterase (ChE) enzyme inhibition activities
   of furan-2-ylmethoxy-substituted compounds 1-7, are reported.
   Peripherally, tetra-substituted copper and manganese phthalocyanines (5
   and 6) were synthesized for the first time. The substitution of
   furan-2-ylmethoxy groups provides remarkable solubility to the complex
   and redshift of the phthalocyanines Q-band. Besides, the inhibitory
   effects of these compounds on acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and alpha-glycosidase (alpha-Gly) enzymes
   have been investigated. The AChE was inhibited by these compounds (1-7)
   in low micromolar levels, and K-i values were recorded between 11.17 +/-
   1.03 and 83.28 +/- 11.08 mu M. Against the BChE, the compounds
   demonstrated K-i values from 7.55 +/- 0.98 to 81.35 +/- 12.80 mu M.
   Also, these compounds (1-7) effectively inhibited alpha-glycosidase,
   with K-i values in the range of 744.87 +/- 67.33 to 1094.38 +/- 88.91 mu
   M. For alpha-glycosidase, the most effective K-i values of
   phthalocyanines 3 and 6 were with K-i values of 744.87 +/- 67.33 and
   880.36 +/- 56.77 mu M, respectively. Moreover, the studied metal
   complexes were docked with target proteins PDB ID: 4PQE, 1P0I, and 3WY1.
   Pharmacokinetic parameters and secondary chemical interactions that play
   an active role in interaction were predicted with docking simulation
   results. Overall, furan-2-ylmethoxy-substituted phthalocyanines can be
   considered as potential agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases
   and diabetes mellitus.}},

   were characterized by spectral data and evaluated for
   acetylcholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase inhibitory activity by
   following Ellman method. Compound 11 a and 11 g with piperazine
   containing acetamide and butyrylamide chains have shown equal potency to
   that of tacrine with IC50 values 0.71 +/- 0.04 and 1.01 +/- 0.03 mu M,

   the potent compounds were tested for liver toxicity and were found to be
   much safer than tacrine. Thus, these new tacrine analogs with five, six

Abstract = {{Farmers represent a population highly vulnerable to the toxic effects of
   pesticide exposure. Antioxidant capacity and biochemical parameters have
   been used as biomarkers of occupational exposure to pesticides. The aim
   of this study was to evaluate hepatic and renal parameters as well as
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity and ferric-reducing ability of
   plasma (FRAP) considering high and low exposure periods in soybean
   farmers in southern Brazil. The exposed group consisted of 50 soybean
   farmers. Two control groups were used, composed by 35 (Novo Hamburgo
   control group) and 28 (Sertao control group) subjects not exposed to
   pesticides. Farmers blood samples were collected during the high and low
   pesticide exposure periods. BChE, aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
   alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), urea,
   and creatinine levels were determined. The FRAP assay was carried out to
   evaluate the antioxidant potential in the exposed group. Considering the
   exposed group, significantly lower BChE and increased AST activity were
   observed during high pesticide exposure period as well as higher FRAP,
   urea and creatinine levels; however, ALT and GGT did not differ between
   the two periods. When compared with the control groups, only urea and
   creatinine were higher in the exposed group. The present results
   indicate that occupational exposure to mixtures of pesticides might
   elicit adverse effects at the biochemical level. In addition, the study
   highlights the importance in considering periods of a same crop season
   with different degree of pesticide exposure during biologic monitoring
   of these biochemical parameters.}},

Title = {{Synthesis and Initial Characterization of a Reversible, Selective
   F-18-Labeled Radiotracer for Human Butyrylcholinesterase}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the
   presence of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques in the brain, which are
   observed in a significant number of cognitively normal, older adults as
   well. In AD, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) becomes associated with
   A(beta) aggregates, making it a promising target for imaging probes to
   support diagnosis of AD. In this study, we present the synthesis,
   radiochemistry, in vitro and preliminary ex and in vivo investigations
   of a selective, reversible BChE inhibitor as PET-tracer for evaluation
   as an AD diagnostic. Procedures Radiolabeling of the inhibitor was
   achieved by fluorination of a respective tosylated precursor using
   K{[}F-18]. IC50 values of the fluorinated compound were obtained in a
   colorimetric assay using recombinant, human (h) BChE. Dissociation
   constants were determined by measuring hBChE activity in the presence of
   different concentrations of inhibitor. Results Radiofluorination of the
   tosylate precursor gave the desired radiotracer in an average
   radiochemical yield of 20 +/- 3 \%. Identity and > 95.5 \% radiochemical
   purity were confirmed by HPLC and TLC autoradiography. The inhibitory
   potency determined in Ellman's assay gave an IC50 value of 118.3 +/-
   19.6 nM. Dissociation constants measured in kinetic experiments revealed
   lower affinity of the inhibitor for binding to the acylated enzyme (K-2
   = 68.0 nM) in comparison to the free enzyme (K-1 = 32.9 nM). Conclusions
   The reversibly acting, selective radiotracer is synthetically easily
   accessible and retains promising activity and binding potential on
   hBChE. Radiosynthesis with F-18 labeling of tosylates was feasible in a
   reasonable time frame and good radiochemical yield.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases related to the
   decrease of neurotransmitter acetylcholine in neurons is based on
   compounds that prevent or disrupt the action of acetylcholinesterase and
   butyrylcholinesterase. A series of thirteen quinuclidine carbamates were
   designed using quinuclidine as the structural base and a carbamate group
   to ensure the covalent binding to the cholinesterase, which were
   synthesized and tested as potential human acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
   and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors. The synthesized compounds
   differed in the substituents on the amino and carbamoyl parts of the
   molecule. All of the prepared carbamates displayed a time-dependent
   inhibition with overall inhibition rate constants in the 10(3) M-1
   min(-1) range. None of the compounds showed pronounced selectivity for
   any of the cholinesterases. The in silico determined ability of
   compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) revealed that six
   compounds should be able to pass the BBB by passive transport. In
   addition, the compounds did not show toxicity toward cells that
   represented the main models of individual organs. By machine learning,
   the most optimal regression models for the prediction of bioactivity
   were established and validated. Models for AChE and BChE described 89
   and 90\% of the total variations among the data, respectively. These
   models facilitated the prediction and design of new and more potent
   inhibitors. Altogether, our study confirmed that quinuclidinium
   carbamates are promising candidates for further development as
   CNS-active drugs, particularly for Alzheimer's disease treatment.}},

Title = {{Changes in Saliva Analytes in Dairy Cows during Peripartum: A Pilot
   Study}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   The use of saliva as a biological fluid to assess welfare and health
   status is gaining interest nowadays since it can be collected by
   non-invasive methods without specialized staff. The possibility of
   measuring analytes in saliva by techniques adapted to automated
   analyzers is cost-effective, reliable, and replicable. These analytes
   can provide information useful for the evaluation of welfare and health
   in dairy cows. In this pilot study, a total of 26 salivary analytes were
   measured in healthy dairy cows along their peripartum period to assess
   possible changes and associations with their inflammatory, energy, and
   milk yield status. Salivary analytes related to stress (cortisol,
   salivary alpha-amylase, butyrylcholinesterase, and total esterase),
   immunity (adenosine deaminase), oxidative status (Trolox equivalent
   antioxidant capacity and the advanced oxidation protein products), and
   general metabolism (creatine kinase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, urea,
   triglycerides, glucose, and lactate) had significant changes throughout
   this period. This study indicated that the saliva of dairy cows shows
   changes in its composition during the transition period and potentially
   can be a source of biomarkers for monitoring health and welfare.
   This pilot study aimed to study the possible changes in a profile of 26
   salivary analytes in thirteen healthy dairy cows along their peripartum
   period. Analytes associated with the stress (salivary cortisol, salivary
   alpha-amylase, butyrylcholinesterase, and total esterase), inflammation
   (adenosine deaminase), oxidative status (total antioxidant capacity and
   the advanced oxidation protein products), and general metabolism
   (creatine kinase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, urea, triglycerides,
   glucose, and lactate) varied along the sampling times. A positive
   correlation between the white blood cells counts, and the lipase, Trolox
   equivalent antioxidant capacity, advanced oxidation protein products,
   and lactate levels in saliva were observed at the delivery. A linear
   association between selected salivary analytes at different sampling
   times and the milk yield after calving was observed. In conclusion, in
   our experimental conditions, it was observed that the peripartum period
   in dairy cows can induce changes in salivary analytes. Some of them were
   associated with inflammatory status and the capacity of milk production
   after calving.}},

Title = {{Metabolomic profiling and biological properties of six Limonium species:
   novel perspectives for nutraceutical purposes dagger}},
Journal = {{FOOD \& FUNCTION}},
Abstract = {{The genus Limonium includes important halophyte plants containing a
   variety of bioactive compounds of therapeutic interest. In the present
   work, the untargeted phytochemical profiles of both aerial part and root
   extracts from six Limonium species namely, L. bellidifolium, L.
   globuliferum, L. gmelinii, L. lilacinum, L. sinuatum and L. iconicum
   from Turkey were determined. Furthermore, several biological activities
   (in vitro antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory effects) were investigated.
   Overall, significant amounts of total phenolics (43.64-238.18 mg g(-1))
   and flavonoids (1.61-129.69 mg g(-1)) were recorded. Particularly, the
   root extracts of L. gmelinii, L. iconicum and L. globuliferum showed the
   highest total phenolic content (204.13-238.18 mg g(-1)), whilst the
   highest total flavonoid content was recorded in the root extracts of L.
   gmelinii (129.69 mg g(-1)). Overall, the tested extracts demonstrated
   potent radical scavenging activities in both DPPH (2,2-
   diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic
   acid) (90.10-507.94 mg g(-1) and 163.39-1175.34 mg g(-1), respectively).
   However, the highest scavenging potential (p < 0.05) was displayed by
   the root extracts of L. iconicum. Conversely, the metal chelating
   ability assay revealed that L. lilacinum root extract showed the highest
   activity (21.03 mg g(-1)). Interestingly, all the extracts were found to
   be active inhibitors of cholinesterases (AChE (acetylcholinesterase):
   4.20-5.11 mg GALAE (galantamine equivalent) per g; BChE
   (butyrylcholinesterase): 3.89-10.75 mg GALAE per g), amylase (0.52-1.09
   mmol ACAE (acarbose equivalent) per g) and tyrosinase (119.41-155.67 mg
   KAE (kojic acid equivalent) per g), unlike for glucosidase (2.31-2.41
   mmol ACAE per g). Taken together, these findings demonstrated a diverse
   chemical profiles and biological of the extracts, to be potentially
   considered as phytotherapeutic or functional ingredients due to their
   antioxidant properties and inhibition of key enzymes involved in several
   diseases.}},

   screened for their human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and
   butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) inhibition activity. One of the new
   compounds, a heterodimer alkaloid of narcikachnine-type, named
   narciabduliine (2), showed balanced inhibition potency for both studied
   enzymes, with IC50 values of 3.29 +/- 0.73 mu M for hAChE and 3.44 +/-

Journal = {{BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Five new examples of
   9,10-chloro(bromo)-7-amine-spiro{[}chromeno{[}4,3-b]quinoline-6,1'-cyclo
   alkanes] - in which cycloalkanes = cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and
   cycloheptane - were synthesized at yields of 42-56\%, using a sequential
   one-pot two-step cyclocondensation reaction of three different scaffolds
   of 2-aminobenzonitriles and the respective
   spiro{[}chroman-2,1'-cycloalkan]-4-ones, and using AlCl3 as the catalyst
   in a solvent-free method. Subsequently, the five new
   spirochromeno-quinolines and nine quinolines previously published by us
   (14 modified tacrine scaffolds) were subjected to AChE and BChE
   inhibitory activity evaluation. The molecule containing a
   spirocyclopentane derivative had the highest AChE and BChE inhibitory
   activity (IC50 = 3.60 and 4.40 mu M, respectively), and in general, the
   non-halogenated compounds were better inhibitors of AChE and BChE than
   the halogenated molecules. However, the inhibitory potency of compounds
   3a-n was weaker than that of tacrine. By molecular docking simulations,
   it was found that the size of the spirocarbocyclic moieties is inversely
   proportional to the inhibitory activity of the cholinesterases, probably
   because an increase in the size of the spirocyclic component sterically
   hindered the interaction of tacrine derivatives with the active site of
   tested cholinesterases. The findings obtained here may help in the
   design and development of new anticholinesterase drugs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report the generation of a polymer-based dynamic
   combinatorial library (DCL) incorporating exchangeable side chains using
   acylhydrazone formation reaction. In combination with tetrameric
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the most potent binding side chain was
   identified, and the information obtained was further used for the
   synthesis of a multivalent BChE inhibitor. In the in vitro biological
   evaluation, this multivalent inhibitor exhibited not only better
   inhibitory effect than the commercial reference but also high
   selectivity on BChE over acetylcholinesterase (AChE).}},

Title = {{A Smartphone Camera Colorimetric Assay of Acetylcholinesterase and
   Butyrylcholinesterase Activity}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) can serve
   as biochemical markers of various pathologies like liver disfunction and
   poisonings by nerve agents. Ellman's assay is the standard
   spectrophotometric method to measure cholinesterase activity in clinical
   laboratories. The authors present a new colorimetric test to assess AChE
   and BChE activity in biological samples using chromogenic reagents,
   treated 3D-printed measuring pads and a smartphone camera as a signal
   detector. Multiwell pads treated with reagent substrates
   2,6-dichlorophenolindophenyl acetate, indoxylacetate, ethoxyresorufin
   and methoxyresorufin were prepared and tested for AChE and BChE. In the
   experiments, 3D-printed pads containing indoxylacetate as a chromogenic
   substrate were optimal for analytical purposes. The best results were
   achieved using the red (R) channel, where the limit of detection was
   4.05 mu kat/mL for BChE and 4.38 mu kat/mL for AChE using a 40 mu L
   sample and a 60 min assay. The major advantage of this method is its
   overall simplicity, as samples are applied directly without any specific
   treatment or added reagents. The assay was also validated to the
   standard Ellman's assay using human plasma samples. In conclusion, this
   smartphone camera-based colorimetric assay appears to have practical
   applicability and to be a suitable method for point-of-care testing
   because it does not require specific manipulation, additional education
   of staff or use of sophisticated analytical instruments.}},

Title = {{An insight into Verbascum bombyciferum extracts: Different extraction
   methodologies, biological abilities and chemical profiles}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The genus Verbascum, commonly known as ``mullein{''}, bears several
   species traditionally used to treat various infections, inflammations
   and wounds. In this study, extracts from V. bombyciferum, an endemic
   Verbascum species from Turkey, obtained by different solvents and
   extraction techniques, were investigated for their bioactive contents
   using spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and evaluated for
   their antioxidant, as well as enzyme inhibitory potentials. While
   spectrophotometric determination revealed the homogenizer assisted
   extraction/methanolic extract to yield the highest total phenolic and
   flavonoid contents (41.80 +/- 0.70 mg GAE/g and 39.44 +/- 0.30 mg RE/g,
   respectively), the most significant total bioactive compounds
   (polyphenols) in the amount of 272.862 mg kg(-1), established by
   HPLC-MS/MS analysis, was noted for the maceration/methanolic extract.
   Overall, the extracts showed varied antioxidant potency, displaying free
   radical scavenging ability (DPPH assay: 1.04-51.33 mg TE/g; ABTS assay:
   80.04-85.60 mg TE/g), reducing power (CUPRAC: 51.48-183.26 mg TE/g;
   FRAP: 36.33-90.04 mg TE/g; metal chelating activity (18.48-19.80 mg
   EDTAE/g) and total antioxidant capacity (phosphomolybdenum assay:
   0.78-1.92 mmol TE/g). However, extract of homogenizer assisted
   extraction/methanol exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in most
   assays. Only the maceration/methanolic extract inhibited all the studied
   enzymes (acetylcholinetserase: 2.02 +/- 0.20 mg GALAE/g;
   butyrylcholinesterase: 4.57 +/- 0.09 mg GALAE/g; tymsinase 21.44 +/-
   3.41 mg KAE/g and amylase: 0.46 +/- 0.01 mmol ACAE/g). This study is the
   first attempt to highlight the potential industrial applications of the
   endemic plant V. bombyciferum, as a natural source of bioactive
   compounds that could be considered for future development of
   phytopharmaceuticals, targeting specific oxidative stress-linked
   diseases including diabetes, skin hyperpigmentation, and neurological
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) represents a promising target
   for imaging probes to potentially enable early diagnosis of

   group strategy for F-18 radiolabeling of carbamate precursors and show
   that the inhibitory potency as well as kinetic properties of our
   unlabeled reference compound were retained in comparison to the parent
   compound. In particular, the prolonged duration of enzyme inhibition of
   such a morpholinocarbamate motivated us to design a PET tracer, possibly
   enabling a precise mapping of BChE distribution.}},

Title = {{Pseudosterase activity-based specific detection of human serum albumin
   on gel}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{224}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Human serum albumin (HSA) has pseudoesterase activity. So far on gel
   specific detection of such property of HSA is never reported. Moreover,
   protein binding dyes are non-specific for albumin. However, many of such
   dyes are used for HSA detection. So, dye-based albumin detection on the
   gel is expected to generate false-positive results for HSA. In this
   context, we have discovered that Fast Blue BB (FBBB, 0.12\%) stains
   specifically HSA pseudoesterase activity with 2 Naphthyl acetate (2NA)
   as an ester substrate. Further, neostigmine has not inhibited the
   pseudoesterase activity associated with HSA.
   Neostigmine is a known inhibitor of many true esterases like
   acetylcholinesterase. So, neostigmine addition offers specificity to the
   method developed for staining of HSA. Additionally, 2NA stains HSA
   better than bovine serum albumin (BSA). Exploring all these novel
   findings, we have devised a simple method of HSA detection on the gel,
   accurately where other esterases are not detected. To the best of our
   knowledge, our method is the first to detect HSA pseudoesterase activity
   specifically on gel without getting interfered by any other esterase
   activity. The method detects HSA better than BSA. We feel that this
   method will go a long way for the specific detection of HSA on the gel.
   It is also relevant for understanding the purity of donor human milk
   matrix and pharmaceutical preparation of HSA. Our method can detect 7 mu
   M of added HSA in human urine. Therefore, our method can be proceeded
   further for microalbuminuria detection in days to come.}},
