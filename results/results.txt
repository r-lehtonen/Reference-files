WE DESIGNED AND SYNTHESIZED NOVEL MULTIFUNCTIONAL LIGANDS FOR WHICH WE ASSESSED THEIR ACTIVITIES TOWARDS BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, BETA SECRETASE, AMYLOID BETA (AŒ≤) AND TAU PROTEIN AGGREGATION AS WELL AS ANTIOXIDANT AND METAL-CHELATING PROPERTIES. ALL COMPOUNDS SHOWED DUAL ANTI-AGGREGATING PROPERTIES TOWARDS AŒ≤ AND TAU PROTEIN IN THE IN CELLULO ASSAY IN ESCHERICHIA COLI. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE COMPOUNDS 24B AND 25B, WHICH EFFICIENTLY INHIBIT AGGREGATION OF AŒ≤ AND TAU PROTEIN AT 10¬†ŒºM (24B: 45% FOR AŒ≤, 53% FOR TAU; 25B: 49% FOR AŒ≤, 54% FOR TAU). THEY DISPLAY FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING CAPACITY AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY IN ABTS AND FRAP ASSAYS, RESPECTIVELY, AND SELECTIVELY CHELATE COPPER IONS. COMPOUNDS 24B AND 25B ARE ALSO THE MOST POTENT INHIBITORS OF BUCHE WITH IC  OF 2.39¬†ŒºM AND 1.94¬†ŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. PROMISING IN¬†VITRO ACTIVITIES OF THE PRESENTED MULTIFUNCTIONAL LIGANDS AS WELL AS THEIR ORIGINAL SCAFFOLD ARE A VERY INTERESTING STARTING POINT FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TOWARDS EFFECTIVE ANTI-AD TREATMENT.

PROLONGED OXIDATIVE STRESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVEREXPRESSION OF ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTERS, WHICH RESULTS IN ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS RESISTANCE. DURING OUR STUDIES, THREE 1,2,4-TRIAZOLE-3-THIONE DERIVATIVES WERE EVALUATED FOR THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY AND ANTICONVULSANT EFFECT IN THE 6¬ÄâHZ MODEL OF PHARMACORESISTANT EPILEPSY. THE INVESTIGATED COMPOUNDS EXHIBITED 2-3 TIMES MORE POTENT ANTICONVULSANT ACTIVITY THAN VALPROIC ACID IN 6¬ÄâHZ TEST IN MICE, WHICH IS WELL-ESTABLISHED PRECLINICAL MODEL OF PHARMACORESISTANT EPILEPSY. THE ANTIOXIDANT/ROS SCAVENGING ACTIVITY WAS CONFIRMED IN BOTH SINGLE-ELECTRON TRANSFER-BASED METHODS (DPPH AND CUPRAC) AND DURING FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF TOTAL ROS ACTIVITY IN U-87¬ÄâMG CELLS. BASED ON THE ENZYMATIC STUDIES ON HUMAN CARBONIC ANHYDRASES (CAS), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), ONE CAN ASSUME THAT THE HEREIN INVESTIGATED DRUG CANDIDATES WILL NOT IMPAIR THE COGNITIVE PROCESSES MEDIATED BY CAS AND WILL HAVE MINIMAL OFF-TARGET CHOLINERGIC EFFECTS.

A 300¬†¬µL VOLUME OF UNDILUTED OIL WAS APPLIED IN HILL TOP CHAMBER SYSTEMS¬Æ, THEN ATTACHED TO FUR-FREE TEST SITES ON BACKS OF MALE AND FEMALE SPRAGUE DAWLEY RATS FOR 6¬†HR/DAY, 5¬†DAYS/WEEK FOR 21¬†DAYS. RECOVERY RATS RECEIVED SIMILAR TREATMENTS AND KEPT FOR 14¬†DAYS POST-EXPOSURE TO SCREEN FOR REVERSIBILITY, PERSISTENCE, OR DELAYED OCCURRENCE OF TOXICITY. IN BRAIN, BOTH VERSIONS OF G3 AND G4 SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED (32-41%) FEMALE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) ACTIVITY WHILE IN MALES ONLY G3-N AND G4-N REDUCED (33%) ACHE ACTIVITY. OILS DID NOT MARKEDLY AFFECT ACHE IN LIVER, REGARDLESS OF GENDER. IN WHOLE BLOOD, G3-U DECREASED FEMALE ACHE (29%) WHICH PERSISTED DURING RECOVERY (32%). G4-N SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED (29%) BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) IN MALE PLASMA, BUT THIS EFFECT WAS RESOLVED DURING RECOVERY. FOR CLINICAL CHEMISTRY INDICES, ONLY GLOBULIN LEVELS IN FEMALE PLASMA SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FOLLOWING G3-N OR G4-N EXPOSURE. PRELIMINARY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY DATA SUGGESTED THAT EFFECTS OF BOTH VERSIONS OF G3 AND G4 ON HIPPOCAMPAL FUNCTION MAY BE GENDER DEPENDENT. AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE WORKERS MAY BE AT RISK IF PRECAUTIONS ARE NOT TAKEN TO MINIMIZE LONG-TERM AIRCRAFT OIL EXPOSURE.

EX TEN., TULIPA HUMILIS HERB., IRIS STENOPHYLLA HAUSSKN. EX BAKER, GALANTHUS ELWESII HOOK. F. AND CROCUS DANFORDIAE MAW. WITH THE AIM TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. POLYPHENOLIC PROFILES OF THE DIFFERENT PLANT PARTS (FLOWER, BULB AND LEAF) OF THE SIX GENOTYPES WERE EVALUATED USING COLORIMETRIC METHODS AS WELL LC-MS/MS. THE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES AND ENZYMES INHIBITORY POTENTIAL (Œ±-AMYLASE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, TYROSINASE AND CHOLINESTERASES) OF THE EXTRACTS WERE DETERMINED. OVERALL, HIGHEST TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT AND TOTAL FLAVONOID CONTENT WERE OBSERVED IN THE LEAF EXTRACTS OF THE STUDIED SPECIES, EXCEPT FOR M. NEGLECTUM (FLOWER EXTRACT) AND T. HUMILIS (FLOWER EXTRACT). LC-MS/MS ANALYSIS REVEALED THE ABUNDANCE OF SOME PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS INCLUDING QUINIC ACID, HESPERIDIN AND CHLOROGENIC ACID IN SELECTIVE EXTRACTS. THE EXTRACTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIALS, WITH LEAF EXTRACT OF THE I. STENOPHYLLA BEING MORE POTENT, WHICH IS LINKED TO ITS HIGH PHENOLIC CONTENTS. ALL THE EXTRACTS DISPLAYED NOTABLE ANTI-ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (1.77 - 2.53¬†MG GALAE/G) AND TYROSINASE (54.9-67.20¬†MG KAE/G). SELECTIVE EXTRACTS HAVE SHOWED ACTIVITY AGAINST BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, WITH BULB EXTRACT OF M. NEGLECTUM (2.99¬†MG GALAE/G), I. STENOPHYLLA (2.53¬†MG GALAE/G) AND G. ELWESII (2.52¬†MG GALAE/G) SHOWING HIGHEST ACTIVITY. MODEST ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED AGAINST Œ±-AMYLASE AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA GATHERED HEREIN IS THE FIRST REPORT ON THE PHYTOCHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES OF THESE BULBOUS PLANT SPECIES WHICH PROJECT THEM AS POTENTIAL SOURCES OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS FOR PHYTOMEDICINES AND NUTRACEUTICALS DEVELOPMENT.

THE PRESENT BIOINFORMATICS STUDY EXPLORES THE BINDING PATTERN AND MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HUMAN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) ENZYMES WITH NATURAL COMPOUNDS FROM BACOPA MONNIERI. THE DOCKING ANALYSIS BETWEEN NATURAL COMPOUNDS AS A LIGAND AND ACHE, BUCHE AS A RECEPTOR WAS COMPLETED USING MGL TOOLS AUTODOCK 4.2 MODULE. THE ANALYSIS OF THE HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS, INHIBITION CONSTANTS, AND HYDROGEN BONDS MAY INDICATES THAT THEY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN FINDING OUT THE INTERACTING POSITION AT THE ACTIVE SITE. HOWEVER, AFTER ANALYZING THE BINDING ENERGY (ŒîG), THE DOCUMENTED DATA SHOWS THAT BACOSIDE X, BACOSIDE A, 3-BETA-D-GLUCOSYLSTIGMASTEROL AND DAUCOSTEROL COULD BE GOOD INHIBITORS IN THE INHIBITION OF ACHE AND BUCHE ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE, OUR STUDY INDICATES THAT THE INHIBITION CONSTANTS OF THE AFORESAID NATURAL COMPOUNDS OF BACOPA CAN BE UTILIZED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INHIBITORS.

J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 44 E13350 2020 10.1111/jfbc.13350 IN THE PRESENT STUDY, A GC-MS METHOD USED FOR QUANTITATIVE SCREENING OF 26 COMPOUNDS (SCLAREOLIDE, SCLAREOL, FERRUGINOL, CRYPTANOL, 6,7-DEHYDROROYLEANONE, SUGINAL, 9,10-DIHYDRO-7,8-DIMETHYL-2-(1-METHYLETHYL) PHENANTHREN-3-OL, SUGIOL, INUROYLEANONE, 12-DEMETHYLMULTICAULINE, 7Œ±-HYDROXY-Œ≤-SITOSTEROL, STIGMASTEROL, SITOSTEROL, SALVIGENIN, SINENSETIN, Œ±-AMYRIN, LUPEOL, LUPENONE, 3-ACETYL LUPEOL, 1Œ±,21Œ±-DIHYDROXY-2,3-(1'1'-DIMETHYL-DIOXYMETHYLENE) URS-9(11),12-DIEN, UVAOL, BETULIN, PYXINOL, LUP-(20),29-ENE-2Œ±-HYDROXY-3Œ≤-ACETATE, BETULIN 3Œ≤, 28Œ≤-DIACETATE, 21Œ±-HYDROXY,2Œ±,3Œ≤-DIACETOXY URS-9(11),12-DIEN) SPECIFIC TO TURKISH SALVIA SPECIES WAS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED. ACCORDING TO THE GC-MS ANALYSIS RESULTS, SALVIA HYPARGEIA FISCH. & C.A. MEY. ROOTS WERE FOUND TO BE RICH IN FERRUGINOL (30787.97¬†¬µG/G EXTRACT) AND LUPENONE (23276.21¬†¬µG/G EXTRACT), AND LEAVES IN LUPEOL (20625.92¬†¬µG/G EXTRACT). ADDITIONALLY, THE ESSENTIAL OIL AND AROMA CONTENTS OF THIS SPECIES WERE IDENTIFIED BY GC-MS TECHNIQUE. ACCORDING TO THE LC-MS/MS RESULTS, ESPECIALLY S. HYPARGEIA LEAF EXTRACT WAS RICH IN ROSMARINIC ACID (38035.7¬†¬µG/G EXTRACT) AND ISOQUERCITRIN (4136.91¬†¬µG/G EXTRACT). FURTHERMORE, ANTICHOLINESTERASE, ANTIUREASE, ANTITYROSINASE AND ANTIELASTASE INHIBITORY, ANTIOXIDANT, CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITIES OF THE ETHANOL EXTRACTS, ESSENTIAL OIL, AND MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE SPECIES WERE EVALUATED. ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIALS OF ALL EXTRACTS OF THIS SPECIES WERE QUITE HIGH IN ALL STUDIED ANTIOXIDANT METHODS. MOREOVER, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND ELASTASE INHIBITORY CAPACITIES OF FERRUGINOL, THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF S. HYPARGEIA ROOTS, WERE NOTABLE. FOR THESE REASONS, THIS SPECIES HAS A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR FOOD AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: THIS NEW GC-MS METHOD WAS APPLIED TO S. HYPARGEIA FISCH. & C.A. MEY. AND IT INDICATED THAT THIS SPECIES POSSESSED HIGH AMOUNT OF FERRUGINOL AND LUPEOL, AND THAT THIS SPECIES COULD BE USED FOR THEIR NATURAL SOURCES. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE ACTIVITY STUDIES (ANTIOXIDANT, ANTICHOLINESTERASE, TYROSINASE, ELASTASE, AND CYTOTOXIC), THIS METHOD WAS USED TO EXHIBIT WHICH COMPOUND MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVITIES. THIS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED METHOD COULD BE EASILY APPLIED TO DETERMINE MAJOR/ACTIVE/TOXIC SECONDARY METABOLITES OF SALVIA SPECIES WHICH ARE USED AND/OR COULD BE USED IN PHARMACEUTICAL, COSMETIC, AND FOOD INDUSTRIES.

INDAPURKAR AS;EANGOOR P;YEH JS;VAKKALANKA M;CASHMAN JR;KNAACK JS A METHOD FOR DIAGNOSING ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDE EXPOSURE IN HUMANS USING LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY. J ANAL TOXICOL 1945-2403 NA NA 2020 10.1093/jat/bkaa197 ORGANOPHOSPHATE (OP) PESTICIDES ARE COMMONLY UTILIZED WORLDWIDE FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES AND POSE A HEALTH THREAT THROUGH AIR, GROUND, AND WATER CONTAMINATION. HERE, WE PRESENT A CONVENIENT METHOD FOR DIAGNOSING EXPOSURE TO OP PESTICIDES IN HUMANS. THIS IMMUNOPRECIPITATION METHOD RELIES ON EXTRACTION OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), A BIOMARKER OF OP POISONING THAT ADDUCTS OP COMPOUNDS, FROM HUMAN SERUM USING AGAROSE BEADS CONJUGATED TO ANTI-BCHE ANTIBODIES. EXTRACTED BCHE WAS THEN DIGESTED WITH PEPSIN AND ANALYZED FOR UNADDUCTED AND OP-ADDUCTED PEPTIDES BY HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (HPLC-MS/MS). TO CHARACTERIZE AND VALIDATE THIS METHOD, POOLED HUMAN PLASMA WAS EXPOSED TO PARATHION AND DICHLORVOS TO FORM DIETHOXYPHOSPHO, AGED ETHOXYPHOSPHO AND DIMETHOXYPHOSPHO ADDUCTS WITH BCHE. UNTREATED PLASMA WAS ALSO ANALYZED FOR UNADDUCTED PEPTIDES. ADDITIONALLY, SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED USING ELLMAN'S ASSAY TO MEASURE BCHE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY. THE PERCENT INHIBITION OF BCHE WAS 53.5¬±5.76 AND 95.2¬±0.37%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR PLASMA TREATED WITH PARATHION FOR 1 HOUR AND 24 HOURS. THE PERCENT INHIBITION WAS 97.2¬±0.98 FOR PLASMA TREATED WITH DICHLORVOS FOR 1 HOUR. THE PERCENT INHIBITION WAS 97.9¬±0.41% WHEN THE PLASMA TREATED WITH PARATHION FOR 1 HOUR, PARATHION FOR 24 HOUR AND DICHLORVOS FOR 1 HOUR WERE MIXED. INDIVIDUAL ADDUCTS WERE QUANTIFIED IN A SINGLE CHROMATOGRAPHIC RUN. UNTREATED PLASMA CONTAINED 26.4¬±1.87 NG/ML OF UNADDUCTED BCHE AND NO ADDUCTED PEPTIDES. IN CONTRAST, THE PLASMA SAMPLE TREATED WITH BOTH PESTICIDES CONTAINED NO UNADDUCTED BCHE, BUT DID CONTAIN 9.46¬±1.10, 10.9¬±0.98 AND 14.1¬±1.10 NG/ML OF DIETHOXYPHOSPHO, AGED-ETHOXY, AND DIMETHOXYPHOSPHO PEPTIDES, RESPECTIVELY. THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE BCHE AND BCHE ADDUCTS TO PARATHION AND DICHLORVOS IS EXPECTED TO BE USEFUL FOR DIAGNOSING HUMAN EXPOSURE TO MULTIPLE OP PESTICIDES.

AMONG THEM, CHLORPYRIFOS IS A COMPOUND RELATED TO GREAT CONTROVERSY, WHICH IS STILL AUTHORIZED AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. HOWEVER, TO SCREEN FOR ITS EXPOSURE MARKERS, INSTRUMENTAL METHODS ARE COMMONLY APPLIED, WHICH CANNOT ENABLE RAPID MONITORING AT AN EARLY STAGE OF AN INTOXICATION. THEREFORE, IN THIS STUDY, A MICROFLUIDIC PAPER-BASED ANALYTICAL DEVICE (ŒºPAD) ABLE TO RAPIDLY SCREEN FOR CHLORPYRIFOS-OXON, THE TOXIC CHLORPYRIFOS METABOLITE, IN HUMAN SERUM WAS DEVELOPED AND FULLY VALIDATED. THE ŒºPAD COMBINES WAX-PRINTED BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) PAPER SENSORS, A LAB-ON-A-CHIP (LOC) PROTOTYPE INJECTOR AND A SMARTPHONE AS THE ANALYTICAL DETECTOR. IN PRINCIPLE, THE WAX-PRINTED STRIPS WITH ADSORBED BCHE ARE EMBEDDED INTO LOC INJECTORS ABLE TO DELIVER SAMPLES AND REAGENTS ON-DEMAND. A SMARTPHONE READER WAS USED TO MONITOR THE COLOR DEVELOPMENT ON THE STRIPS PROVIDING BINARY QUALITATIVE RESULTS. ŒºPAD METHOD PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS WERE THOROUGHLY EVALUATED IN TERMS OF SPECIFICITY, DETECTION CAPABILITY (CCŒ≤) AND RUGGEDNESS.

KUMAR V;DE P;OJHA PK;SAHA A;ROY K A MULTI-LAYERED VARIABLE SELECTION STRATEGY FOR QSAR MODELING OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. CURR TOP MED CHEM 1873-4294 20 1601-1627 2019 10.2174/1568026620666200616142753 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD), A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER, IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF SENILE DEMENTIA. BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) ENZYME PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN REGULATING THE BRAIN ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH) NEUROTRANSMITTER, BUT IN THE CASE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD), BUCHE ACTIVITY GRADUALLY INCREASES IN PATIENTS WITH A DECREASE IN THE ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH) CONCENTRATION VIA HYDROLYSIS. ACH PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN REGULATING LEARNING AND MEMORY AS THE CORTEX ORIGINATES FROM THE BASAL FOREBRAIN, AND THUS, IS INVOLVED IN MEMORY CONSOLIDATION IN THESE SITES. IN THIS WORK, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (PLS)-REGRESSION BASED TWO DIMENSIONAL QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP (2D-QSAR) MODEL USING 1130 DIVERSE CHEMICAL CLASSES OF COMPOUNDS WITH DEFINED ACTIVITY AGAINST THE BUCHE ENZYME. KEEPING IN MIND THE STRICT ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) GUIDELINES, WE HAVE TRIED TO SELECT SIGNIFICANT DESCRIPTORS FROM THE LARGE INITIAL POOL OF DESCRIPTORS USING MULTI-LAYERED VARIABLE SELECTION STRATEGY USING STEPWISE REGRESSION FOLLOWED BY GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) FOLLOWED BY AGAIN STEPWISE REGRESSION TECHNIQUE AND AT THE END BEST SUBSET SELECTION PRIOR TO DEVELOPMENT OF FINAL MODEL THUS REDUCING NOISE IN THE INPUT. PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (PLS) REGRESSION TECHNIQUE WAS EMPLOYED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINAL MODEL WHILE MODEL VALIDATION WAS PERFORMED USING VARIOUS STRINGENT VALIDATION CRITERIA. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE QSAR MODEL SUGGESTED THAT THE QUALITY OF THE MODEL IS ACCEPTABLE IN TERMS OF BOTH INTERNAL (R2= 0.664, Q2= 0.650) AND EXTERNAL (R2 PRED= 0.657) VALIDATION PARAMETERS. THE QSAR STUDIES WERE ANALYZED, AND THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES (HYDROPHOBIC, RING AROMATIC AND HYDROGEN BOND ACCEPTOR/DONOR) RESPONSIBLE FOR ENHANCEMENT OF THE ACTIVITY WERE IDENTIFIED. THE DEVELOPED MODEL FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THE PRESENCE OF HYDROPHOBIC FEATURES LIKE LONG CARBON CHAIN WOULD INCREASE THE BUCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AND PRESENCE OF AMINO GROUP AND HYDRAZINE FRAGMENT PROMOTING THE HYDROGEN BOND INTERACTIONS WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR INCREASING THE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST BUCHE ENZYME. FURTHERMORE, MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE LIGAND AND RECEPTOR, AND THE RESULTS ARE THEN CORRELATED WITH THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OBTAINED FROM THE QSAR MODELS. THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE QSAR MODELS ARE WELL CORROBORATED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE DOCKING STUDY.

TWO SELECTED MUTANTS OF HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (E197Q AND E197G) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS WORK. AS FOR THE ELLMAN'S METHOD, SUBSTRATES ARE THIOCHOLINE ESTERS, BUT THE CHROMOGENIC REAGENT, DTNB (DITHIO-BISNITRO BENZOIC ACID) IS REPLACED BY A FLUOROGENIC PROBE, "CALBIOCHEM PROBE IV", (3-(7-HYDROXY-2-OXO-2H-CHROMEN-3-YLCARBAMOYL)ACRYLIC ACID METHYLESTER). COMPARED TO THE CLASSICAL ELLMAN'S METHOD, THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS NEW SPECTROFLUORIMETRIC ASSAY IS 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER. THE METHOD ALLOWS MEASUREMENT OF ACTIVITY IN MEDIA CONTAINING <10 ¬ÄØM OF CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVE SITES AT LOW SUBSTRATE CONCENTRATIONS, EITHER UNDER FIRST ORDER CONDITIONS, [S]¬ÄØ<¬ÄØK , OR UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE KINETICS OBEYS THE MICHAELIS-MENTEN MODEL, I.E. AT [S]¬ÄØ<¬ÄØ1¬ÄØMM FOR WILD-TYPE ENZYMES. THE METHOD ADAPTED TO TITRATION PLATE READER ASSAYS IS SUITABLE FOR CLINICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL ROUTINE ANALYSES, FOR HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING OF NOVEL CHOLINESTERASE MUTANTS AND SCREENING OF INHIBITOR LIBRARIES OF PHARMACOLOGICAL INTEREST.

ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ARE KNOWN TO BE SERINE HYDROLASE ENZYMES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HYDROLYSIS OF ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH). INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASES IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO CURB ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. HERE, WE PREPARED 12 NEW 6-SUBSTITUTED-3(2H)-PYRIDAZINONE-2-ACETYL-2-(NONSUBSTITUTED/4-SUBSTITUTED BENZENESULFONOHYDRAZIDE) DERIVATIVES AND EVALUATED THEIR INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON ACHE/BCHE IN PURSUIT OF POTENT DUAL INHIBITORS FOR ALZHEIRMER'S DISEASE. WE ALSO TRIED TO GET INSIGHTS INTO BINDING INTERACTIONS OF THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS IN THE ACTIVE SITE OF BOTH ENZYMES BY USING MOLECULAR DOCKING APPROACH. WE OBTAINED OUR COMPOUNDS BY THE REACTION OF VARIOUS SUBSTITUTED/NONSUBSTITUTED BENZENESULFONIC ACID DERIVATIVES WITH 6-SUBSTITUTEDPHENYL-3(2H)-PYRIDAZINONE-2-YL ACETOHYDRAZIDE AND DETERMINED THEIR ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES ACCORDING TO THE ELLMAN'S METHOD. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES WERE DONE USING GLIDE AND THE RESULTS WERE EVALUATED ON MAESTRO (SCHR√∂DINGER, LLC, NEW YORK, NY, 2019). THE TITLE COMPOUNDS SHOWED MODERATE INHIBITION AT 100¬ÄØŒºG/ML AGAINST BOTH ENZYMES, YET WITH BETTER ACTIVITY AGAINST BCHE. COMPOUND VI  EMERGED AS A DUAL INHIBITOR WITH 25.02% AND 51.70% INHIBITION AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE, RESPECTIVELY. THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THAT NOVEL PYRIDAZINONE DERIVATES MAY BE USED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BCHE INHIBITORY AGENTS. IT WAS LESS POTENT THAN THE REFERENCE DRUGS, YET PROMISING FOR FURTHER MODIFICATIONS AS A LEAD. THE ABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS TO ADOPT ENERGETICALLY MORE FAVOURABLE CONFORMATIONS AND TO ENGAGE IN MORE KEY INTERACTIONS IN THE ECBCHE ACTIVE GORGE EXPLAINS THEIR BETTER ACTIVITY PROFILE AGAINST ECBCHE.

EUR J MED CHEM 1768-3254 180 613-626 2019 10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.07.051 THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTITARGET COMPOUNDS AGAINST MULTIFACTORIAL DISEASES, SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, IS AN AREA OF VERY INTENSIVE RESEARCH, DUE TO THE EXPECTED SUPERIOR THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY THAT SHOULD ARISE FROM THE SIMULTANEOUS MODULATION OF SEVERAL KEY TARGETS OF THE COMPLEX PATHOLOGICAL NETWORK. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE SYNTHESIS AND MULTITARGET BIOLOGICAL PROFILING OF A NEW CLASS OF COMPOUNDS DESIGNED BY MOLECULAR HYBRIDIZATION OF AN NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST FLUOROBENZOHOMOADAMANTANAMINE WITH THE POTENT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) INHIBITOR 6-CHLOROTACRINE, USING TWO DIFFERENT LINKER LENGTHS AND LINKAGE POSITIONS, TO PRESERVE OR NOT THE MEMANTINE-LIKE POLYCYCLIC UNSUBSTITUTED PRIMARY AMINE. THE BEST HYBRIDS EXHIBIT GREATER POTENCIES THAN PARENT COMPOUNDS AGAINST ACHE (IC  0.33¬ÄØNM IN THE BEST CASE, 44-FOLD INCREASED POTENCY OVER 6-CHLOROTACRINE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (IC  21¬ÄØNM IN THE BEST CASE, 24-FOLD INCREASED POTENCY OVER 6-CHLOROTACRINE), AND NMDA RECEPTORS (IC  0.89¬ÄØŒºM IN THE BEST CASE, 2-FOLD INCREASED POTENCY OVER THE PARENT BENZOHOMOADAMANTANAMINE AND MEMANTINE), WHICH SUGGESTS AN ADDITIVE EFFECT OF BOTH PHARMACOPHORIC MOIETIES IN THE INTERACTION WITH THE PRIMARY TARGETS. MOREOVER, MOST OF THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN PREDICTED TO BE BRAIN PERMEABLE. THIS SET OF BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES MAKES THEM PROMISING LEADS FOR FURTHER ANTI-ALZHEIMER DRUG DEVELOPMENT.

TOXICOL SCI 1096-0929 174 133-146 2019 10.1093/toxsci/kfz251 CHEMICAL WARFARE NERVE AGENTS (CWNAS) PRESENT A GLOBAL THREAT TO BOTH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN POPULATIONS. THE ACUTE TOXICITY OF CWNAS STEMS FROM THEIR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE). THIS INHIBITION CAN LEAD TO UNCONTROLLED CHOLINERGIC CELLULAR SIGNALING, RESULTING IN CHOLINERGIC CRISIS AND, ULTIMATELY, DEATH. ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT FDA-APPROVED STANDARD OF CARE IS MODERATELY EFFECTIVE WHEN ADMINISTERED EARLY, DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TREATMENT STRATEGIES IS NECESSARY. BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) IS AN ENZYME WHICH DISPLAYS A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURAL HOMOLOGY TO ACHE. UNLIKE ACHE, THE ROLES OF BCHE ARE UNCERTAIN AND POSSIBILITIES ARE STILL BEING EXPLORED. HOWEVER, BCHE APPEARS TO PRIMARILY SERVE AS A BIOSCAVENGER OF TOXIC ESTERS DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE A WIDE VARIETY OF SUBSTRATES WITHIN ITS ACTIVE SITE. LIKE ACHE, BCHE IS ALSO READILY INHIBITED BY CWNAS. DUE TO ITS HIGH AFFINITY FOR BINDING CWNAS, AND THAT NULL-BCHE YIELDS NO APPARENT HEALTH EFFECTS, EXOGENOUS BCHE HAS BEEN EXPLORED AS A CANDIDATE THERAPEUTIC FOR CWNA INTOXICATION. DESPITE YEARS OF RESEARCH, MINIMAL STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE TO DEVELOP A CATALYTIC BIOSCAVENGER. FURTHERMORE, BCHE IS ONLY IN EARLY CLINICAL TRIALS AS A STOICHIOMETRIC BIOSCAVENGER OF CWNAS, AND LARGE QUANTITIES MUST BE ADMINISTERED TO TREAT CWNA TOXICITY. HERE, WE DESCRIBE PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED MUTATIONS TO RESIDUES WITHIN AND ADJACENT TO THE ACYL BINDING POCKET (POSITIONS 282-285 WERE MUTAGENIZED FROM YGTP TO NHML) OF BCHE THAT CONFER CATALYTIC DEGRADATION OF THE CWNA, SARIN. THESE MUTATIONS, ALONG WITH CORRESPONDING FUTURE EFFORTS, MAY FINALLY LEAD TO A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TO COMBAT CWNA INTOXICATION.

WE AIMED AT COLLECTING PRELIMINARY DATA ON WHETHER ADDITION OF THE COMPETITIVE NICOTINIC ANTAGONIST ROCURONIUM TO STANDARD EARLY THERAPY MIGHT BE CLINICALLY FEASIBLE AND ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED DURATION OF VENTILATION.  A PILOT THREE-ARM DOSE-RESPONSE PHASE II TRIAL WAS SET UP TO COMPARE BOLUS DOSES OF ROCURONIUM BROMIDE TITRATED TO PRODUCE INITIAL >95% OR 50% INHIBITION OF NEUROMUSCULAR FUNCTION, MEASURED USING ACCELEROMYOGRAPHY, PLUS STANDARD TREATMENT, VERSUS STANDARD TREATMENT ALONE. AFTER ATTAINING INHIBITION, PATIENTS RECEIVING BOLUS ROCURONIUM THEN RECEIVED ROCURONIUM INFUSIONS FOR A MAXIMUM OF 120¬ÄâH. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS DURATION OF INTUBATION; SECONDARY OUTCOME WAS CASE FATALITY. PLASMA BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED THROUGHOUT THE INPATIENT STAY. BLOOD WAS ANALYSED TO CONFIRM THE ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDE INGESTED.  FORTY-FIVE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE: ROCURONIUM TO INITIALLY ATTAIN 95% INHIBITION (ROC>95,  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ15), ROCURONIUM TO INITIALLY ATTAIN 50% INHIBITION (ROC50,  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ14), OR NO ROCURONIUM (CONTROL,  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ16). THE MOST COMMONLY INGESTED PESTICIDE WAS PROFENOFOS (29/45, 64.4%). BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY REMAINED SEVERELY INHIBITED FOR THE DURATION OF THE STUDY FOR MOST PATIENTS. CASE FATALITY WAS 9/45 (20%) AND SIMILAR ACROSS STUDY ARMS: CONTROL 3/16 (18.8%), ROC50 4/14 (28.6%) AND ROC>95 2/15 (13.3%) ( ¬Äâ=¬Äâ.5842). WHEN EXCLUDING PATIENTS WHO DIED, MEDIAN [IQR] DURATION OF INTUBATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER IN THE ROC50 (259.5 [176-385]¬†H) AND ROC>95 (226.8 [186-355]¬†H) GROUPS COMPARED TO CONTROLS (88.5 [47-160]¬†H,  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ.0162 AND  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ.0016, RESPECTIVELY).  IN THIS PILOT DOSE-RESPONSE STUDY, WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT ROCURONIUM IN ADDITION TO STANDARD THERAPY REDUCED THE DURATION OF INTUBATION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT WORSENED NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION FUNCTION. FURTHER CLINICAL RESEARCH, INCLUDING TESTING OF SHORTER DURATION REGIMENS, NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED BEFORE NICOTINIC ANTAGONISTS CAN BE USED IN THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF OP POISONING.

THERE IS CURRENTLY NO AVAILABLE TREATMENT THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH COCAINE OVERDOSE OR THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY PREVENT RELAPSE IN RECOVERING ADDICTS. ONE RECENTLY DEVELOPED APPROACH TO TREAT THESE PROBLEMS IS THE USE OF ENZYMES THAT RAPIDLY BREAK DOWN THE ACTIVE COCAINE MOLECULE INTO INACTIVE METABOLITES. IN PARTICULAR, RATIONAL DESIGN AND SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS TRANSFORMED HUMAN SERUM RECOMBINANT BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INTO A HIGHLY EFFICIENT COCAINE HYDROLASE WITH DRASTICALLY IMPROVED CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY TOWARD (-)-COCAINE. A CURRENT DRAWBACK PREVENTING THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF THIS PROMISING ENZYME-BASED THERAPY IS THE LACK OF A COST-EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION STRATEGY THAT IS ALSO FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO RAPIDLY SCALE-UP IN RESPONSE TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN ENZYME DESIGN. PLANT-BASED EXPRESSION SYSTEMS PROVIDE A UNIQUE SOLUTION AS THIS PLATFORM IS DESIGNED FOR FAST SCALABILITY, LOW COST AND THE ADVANTAGE OF PERFORMING EUKARYOTIC PROTEIN MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS GLYCOSYLATION. A PLANT-DERIVED FORM OF THE COCAINE SUPER HYDROLASE (A199S/F227A/S287G/A328W/Y332G) WE DESIGNATE PCOCSH PROTECTS MICE FROM COCAINE OVERDOSE, COUNTERS THE LETHAL EFFECTS OF ACUTE COCAINE OVERDOSE, AND PREVENTS REINSTATEMENT OF EXTINGUISHED DRUG-SEEKING BEHAVIOR IN MICE THAT UNDERWENT PLACE CONDITIONING WITH COCAINE. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE NOVEL PCOCSH ENZYME MAY WELL SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC FOR COCAINE USE DISORDERS IN A CLINICAL SETTING.

BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) HYDROLYZES AG TO DES-ACYL-GHRELIN (DAG), POTENTIALLY DECREASING APPETITE. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE FTO RS9939609 GENOTYPE AND EXERCISE ON BCHE ACTIVITY, AG, DAG, AND ENERGY INTAKE ARE UNKNOWN. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT INDIVIDUALS HOMOZYGOUS FOR THE OBESITY-RISK A-ALLELE (AAS) WOULD EXHIBIT HIGHER POSTPRANDIAL AG AND ENERGY INTAKE THAN INDIVIDUALS HOMOZYGOUS FOR THE LOW OBESITY-RISK T-ALLELE (TTS), BUT THAT EXERCISE WOULD INCREASE BCHE ACTIVITY AND DIMINISH THESE DIFFERENCES. TWELVE AA AND 12 TT NORMAL-WEIGHT MALES COMPLETED A CONTROL (8 H REST) AND AN EXERCISE (1 H OF EXERCISE AT 70% PEAK OXYGEN UPTAKE, 7 H REST) TRIAL IN A RANDOMIZED CROSSOVER DESIGN. A FIXED MEAL WAS CONSUMED AT 1.5 H AND AN AD LIBITUM BUFFET MEAL AT 6.5 H. APPETITE, APPETITE-RELATED HORMONES, BCHE ACTIVITY, AND ENERGY INTAKE WERE ASSESSED. AAS DISPLAYED LOWER BASELINE BCHE ACTIVITY, HIGHER BASELINE AG:DAG RATIO, ATTENUATED AG SUPPRESSION AFTER A FIXED MEAL, AND HIGHER AD LIBITUM ENERGY INTAKE COMPARED WITH TTS [EFFECT SIZES (ESS)¬†¬â•¬†0.72, P¬†¬â§¬†0.049]. EXERCISE INCREASED Œî BCHE ACTIVITY IN BOTH GENOTYPES (ESS¬†=¬†0.37, P¬†=¬†0.004); HOWEVER, EXERCISE LOWERED AG AND THE AG:DAG RATIO TO A GREATER EXTENT IN AAS (P¬†¬â§¬†0.023), OFFSETTING THE HIGHER AG PROFILE OBSERVED IN AAS DURING THE CONTROL TRIAL (ESS¬†¬â•¬†1.25, P¬†¬â§¬†0.048). EXERCISE DID NOT ELEVATE ENERGY INTAKE IN EITHER GENOTYPE (P¬†=¬†0.282). EXERCISE INCREASES BCHE ACTIVITY, SUPPRESSES AG AND THE AG:DAG RATIO, AND CORRECTS THE HIGHER AG PROFILE OBSERVED IN OBESITY-RISK AA INDIVIDUALS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT EXERCISE OR OTHER METHODS TARGETING BCHE ACTIVITY MAY OFFER A PREVENTATIVE AND/OR THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR AA INDIVIDUALS. THIS TRIAL WAS REGISTERED AT CLINICALTRIALS.GOV AS NCT03025347.

When o-phenylenediamine (OPD) was oxidized by Cu2+, the product 2,3-diaminophenazine (oxOPD) could effectively quench the fluorescence of CDs at 460‚ÄØnm due to the inner filter effect and gave rise to a new emission peak at 570‚ÄØnm. The AChE or BChE catalyzed hydrolysis reaction of acetylthiocholine or butyrylthiocholine to generate thiocholine, whose sulfhydryl group strongly captured Cu2+ to inhibit the oxidization of OPD, thus effectively preserving the natural fluorescence emission of CDs. The resulting fluorescence intensity ratio served as the signal output of the probe for cholinesterases (ChEs) activity sensing. The activities of AChE and BChE were determined to range from 0.2 to 14.0 U L‚àí1 and from 0.1 to 5.0 U L‚àí1, with detection limits of 0.1 U L‚àí1 and 0.04 U L‚àí1, respectively. Additionally, the IC50 of tacrine and ethopropazine for the inhibition of AChE and BChE were estimated to be 29.8‚ÄØnM and 132.6‚ÄØnM, respectively. Moreover, the probe was successfully applied to the discriminative determination of AChE and BChE in human whole blood without any pretreatment. These results suggested that the proposed strategy provided a discriminative, sensitive and robust analytical platform for ChEs clinical diagnostics and drug screening.

INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASES IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO CURB ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, A PROGRESSIVE AND FATAL NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER. IN THIS STUDY, 30 NEW HYDRAZONE DERIVATIVES WERE SYNTHESIZED. THEN WE EVALUATED THEIR ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO TRIED TO GET INSIGHTS INTO BINDING INTERACTIONS OF THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS IN THE ACTIVE SITE OF BOTH ENZYMES BY USING MOLECULAR DOCKING APPROACH. THE COMPOUNDS WERE SYNTHESIZED BY THE REACTION OF VARIOUS SUBSTITUTED/NONSUBSTITUTED BENZALDEHYDES WITH 6-(SUBSTITUTE/NONSUBSTITUEPHENYL)-3(2H)-PYRIDAZINONE-2-YL PROPIYOHYDRAZIDE. ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS WAS DETERMINED USING ELLMAN'S METHOD. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES WERE DONE BY USING THE ADT PACKAGE VERSION 1.5.6RC3 AND SHOWED BY MAESTRO. RMSD VALUES WERE OBTAINED USING LAMARCKIAN GENETIC ALGORITHM AND SCORING FUNCTION OF AUTODOCK 4.2 RELEASE 4.2.5.1 SOFTWARE. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPOUNDS WERE COMPARED WITH GALANTAMINE AS CHOLINESTERASE ENZYME INHIBITOR, WHERE SOME OF THE COMPOUNDS SHOWED HIGHER BCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY THAN GALANTAMINE.

IN THE TRADITIONAL PRACTICE, MASS SPECTROMETRY IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL TOOLS AND IS WIDELY STUDIED. HOWEVER, THE TEST OF HUMAN SERUM USUALLY REQUIRES COMPLICATED SAMPLE PRETREATMENT, TEDIOUS OPERATIONS, AND PRECISE CONDITION CONTROL, ESPECIALLY FOR THE DETECTION OF ENZYMES AS BIOMARKERS. AS BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) HAS AN INDICATIVE SIGNIFICANCE IN DETECTING DEGENERATIVE DISEASE, LIVER INJURY, AND ORGANOPHOSPHATE POISONING, THE QUICK QUANTIFICATION OF BUCHE IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THE CLINIC. IN THIS PAPER, WE REPORT THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PORTABLE 3D-PRINTED ENZYME REACTOR PAPER SPRAY CARTRIDGE (3D ER-PS) WITH INTEGRATED FUNCTIONS: TEMPERATURE CONTROL, ENZYME REACTION, ANALYTE TRANSFER, AND PAPER SPRAY IONIZATION. COUPLED WITH MASS SPECTROMETRY, QUANTITATIVE TESTING OF BUCHE ACTIVITY IN HUMAN SERUM WAS REALIZED CONVENIENTLY AND ACCURATELY. WHILE IT ONLY REQUIRES VERY SIMPLE SAMPLE PREPARATION, THE RESULTS FROM CURRENT 3D ER-PS APPROACH ARE WELL CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBTAINED USING ELLMAN'S METHOD. THIS 3D ER-PS PLATFORM NOT ONLY PROVIDES A NOVEL SOLUTION FOR THE LIQUID BIOPSY OF BUCHE IN CLINICS BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUICK AND TARGETED MEDICAL APPROACHES FOR ANALYZING OTHER TYPES OF SERUM BIOMARKER MOLECULES IN THE FIELD OF DISEASE DIAGNOSIS.

PRECLINICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ACUTE OP-INDUCED EFFECTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INHIBITING THE BRAIN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) ENZYME. THE OP TRIAZOPHOS HAS BEEN USED WORLDWIDE, ALTHOUGH ITS EFFECTS ON MNEMONIC PROCESSING ARE YET TO BE INVESTIGATED. BASED ON THE ABOVE, THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER ACUTE TRIAZOPHOS INTOXICATION INTERFERES WITH THE EXPRESSION AND EXTINCTION OF CONTEXTUAL FEAR MEMORY IN RATS. HIPPOCAMPAL AND AMYGDALAR ACHE ACTIVITY AND PLASMA BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WERE MEASURED AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT TO CONFIRM THE CHOLINERGIC OVERSTIMULATION. INDEPENDENT COHORTS OF ANIMALS INTOXICATED WITH TRIAZOPHOS WERE EVALUATED IN THE NOVEL OBJECT RECOGNITION (NOR) TEST, A LESS AVERSIVE ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY TASK. AT THE DOSE OF 15¬†MG/KG, TRIAZOPHOS ADMINISTERED IMMEDIATELY AFTER CONTEXTUAL FEAR CONDITIONING IMPAIRED THE EXTINCTION BUT NOT THE EXPRESSION OF FREEZING BEHAVIOR. TRIAZOPHOS POISONING INDUCED NO CHANGES IN THE DISCRIMINATION INDEX IN THE NOR TEST. TRIAZOPHOS INHIBITED THE ACHE ACTIVITY IN A TIME- AND BRAIN REGION-DEPENDENT MANNER. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT FEAR MEMORY EXTINCTION DEFICITS INDUCED BY ACUTE TRIAZOPHOS INTOXICATION ARE ACCOMPANIED BY HIPPOCAMPAL ACHE INHIBITION. THE DEFICIENT FEAR EXTINCTION ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE OP POISONING MAY REPRESENT A BEHAVIORAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PHENOTYPE HELPFUL TO STUDY MECHANISMS OF NEUROTOXICITY AND TREATMENT APPROACH OF OP SUICIDE SURVIVORS.

BECAUSE OF CRITICAL TARGETING OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) IN THE CNS BY OPS, A PRE-TREATMENT CANDIDATE FOR PREVENTING/REDUCING POISONING WILL BE A BROADLY ACTING MOLECULE THAT SCAVENGES OPS IN BLOOD BEFORE THEY REACH THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL TARGETS. PROPHYLACTIC HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (HUBCHE), THE LEADING PRETREATMENT CANDIDATE, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PROTECT AGAINST MULTIPLE LD 'S OF NERVE AGENTS IN RODENTS, MACAQUES, AND MINIPIGS. THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HUBCHE BIOSCAVENGER PRETREATMENT FROM EARLY PROOF-OF-CONCEPT STUDIES TO PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES WITH THE NATIVE INJECTABLE ENZYME AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AEROSOLIZED FORMS OF RECOMBINANT ENZYME, WHICH CAN BE DELIVERED BY INHALATION NEBULIZER DEVICES, TO EFFECT PROTECTION AGAINST INHALED OP NERVE AGENTS AND INSECTICIDES. EARLY ANIMAL STUDIES UTILIZED PARENTERAL EXPOSURE. HOWEVER, LUNGS ARE THE PORTAL OF ENTRY FOR MOST VOLATILE OP VAPORS AND REPRESENT THE MAJOR MEANS OF OP INTOXICATION. IN THIS REGARD, PRETREAT-MENT WITH 7.5¬†MG/KG OF HUBCHE BY IM INJECTION PROTECTED MINIPIGS AGAINST LETHAL SARIN VAPOR AND PREVENTED ACHE INHIBITION IN THE BLOOD. THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE FIVE-DAY PROTECTION IN MACAQUES BY AN AEROSOLIZED RHUBCHE USING A NEBULIZER AGAINST AEROSOLIZED PARAOXON (ESTIMATED TO BE AN 8¬†MG/KG ESTIMATED HUMAN DOSE). IMPORTANTLY, LETHAL INHALED DOSES OF OP MAY BE SMALLER RELATIVE TO THE SAME DOSE DELIVERED BY INJECTION, THUS REDUCING THE PROTECTIVE HUBCHE DOSE, WHILE A COMBINATION OF HUBCHE AND POST-EXPOSURE OXIME MAY PROLONG PROTECTION.

THE ANIMALS WERE DIVIDED INTO 4 GROUPS OF 6 ANIMALS/EACH. GROUP 1 (CONTROL GROUP) RECEIVED CORN OIL, WHILE GROUPS 2, 3, AND 4 WERE GIVEN MALATHION DISSOLVED IN CORN OIL AT A DOSE OF 100, 200 AND 400 MG/KG, RESPECTIVELY. 24 HOURS AFTER MALATHION ADMINISTRATION, ANIMALS WERE SACRIFICED AND LIVER TISSUES WERE COLLECTED. THE LIVER TISSUES WERE THEN ANALYSED BIOCHEMICALLY AND HISTOPATHOLOGICALLY. BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS IN GROUPS 2, 3 AND 4 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF GROUP 1. TOTAL OXIDANT STATUS AND TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA LEVEL WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN GROUP 4 COMPARED TO GROUP 1. CATALASE ACTIVITIES OF GROUPS 3 AND 4 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF GROUP 1. ARYLESTERASE ACTIVITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN GROUPS 3 AND 4 COMPARED TO GROUP 1.

MORE RECENTLY, RESEARCHERS EXPANDED THE USE OF GENE THERAPY IN NON-CLINICAL STUDIES TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES THROUGH THE DELIVERY OF VECTORIZED ANTIBODIES TO WELL-DEFINED ANTIGENS. HERE, WE FURTHER EXTEND THE UTILITY OF GENE THERAPY BEYOND THE "ACCEPTED" INDICATIONS TO INCLUDE ORGANOPHOSPHATE POISONING. THERE ARE NO APPROVED PREVENTIVES FOR THE MULTI-ORGAN DAMAGE RESULTING FROM ACUTE OR CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATES. WE SHOW THAT A SINGLE INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION OF ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS VECTOR PRODUCES PEAK EXPRESSION (~0.5 MG/ML) OF ACTIVE HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (HBCHE) IN MICE SERUM WITHIN 3-4 WEEKS POST-TREATMENT. THIS EXPRESSION IS SUSTAINED FOR UP TO 140 DAYS POST-INJECTION WITH NO SILENCING. SUSTAINED EXPRESSION OF HBCHE PROVIDED DOSE-DEPENDENT PROTECTION AGAINST VX IN MALE AND FEMALE MICE DESPITE DETECTABLE ANTIBODIES TO HBCHE IN SOME MICE, THEREBY DEMONSTRATING THAT EXPRESSION OF HBCHE IN VIVO IN MOUSE MUSCLE IS AN EFFECTIVE PROPHYLACTIC AGAINST ORGANOPHOSPHATE POISONING.

All the investigated compounds showed a strong inhibitory potency toward both enzymes with IC50 values in micromolar range of concentration; compound 1 displayed the most potent inhibitory behaviour toward both enzymes. The mechanism of the AChE and BuChE inhibition was examined by enzyme kinetic measurements. The obtained kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km indicated an uncompetitive type of inhibition of both enzymes by compound 1. For the other two compounds a non-competitive inhibition mode was observed. To get further insight into the mechanism of action and to elucidate binding modes in details we examined the interactions of 1‚Äì3 with acetylcholinesterase, using molecular docking approach. Grid based docking studies indicated that these compounds can bind to peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the AChE with Ki values in micromolar range. Moreover, blind docking revealed the capability of investigated compounds to bind to new allosteric site (i.e. binding site II) distinct from PAS. Showing that these Cu-based compounds can act as new allosteric inhibitors of AChE and identifying novel allosteric binding site on AChE represents a significant contribution toward the design of novel and more effective inhibitors of AChE.
ACET T;OZCAN K;ZENGIN G AN ASSESSMENT OF PHENOLIC PROFILES, FATTY ACID COMPOSITIONS, AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF TWO HELICHRYSUM SPECIES: H. PLICATUM AND H. CHIONOPHILUM. J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 44 E13128 2019 10.1111/jfbc.13128 IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE AIMED TO SEARCH AND COMPARE THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE ETHANOL (ETOH), METHANOL (MEOH), AND ETHYLACETATE (ETOAC) SOLVENT EXTRACTS OF THE FLOWER, STEM, AND ROOT PARTS OF TWO HELICHRYSUM PLANTS (H. CHIONOPHILUM (HC) AND H. PLICATUM SUBSP. PLICATUM (HP)). THE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES WERE DETERMINED BY USING (2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL) (DPPH) AND ABTS (2,2'-AZINO-BIS(3-ETHYLBENZOTHIAZOLINE-6-SULFONIC ACID) (ABTS) ASSAYS. THE ENZYME INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF THE EXTRACTS WERE INVESTIGATED ON BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, AND Œ±-AMYLASE. PALMITIC ACID (C 16:0) WAS ALSO DETERMINED AS MAJOR FATTY ACIDS IN THE TESTED OILS (31.21%-67.68%). IN BOTH PLANTS, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ETOAC EXTRACTS OF THE FLOWERS HAD A STRONG ANTIOXIDANT AND ENZYME INHIBITORY EFFECT. IN CONCLUSION, THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THAT H. CHIONOPHILUM AND H. PLICATUM CAN BE SEEN AS A PROMISING SOURCE FOR THE NATURAL BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN BE USED IN THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: THE MEMBERS OF THE GENUS HELICHRYSUM HAVE BEEN WIDELY TAKEN FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES IN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AS WELL AS FOOD. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE INVESTIGATED THE CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF TWO HELICHRYSUM SPECIES EXTRACTS (H. CHIONOPHILUM AND H. PLICATUM SUBSP. PLICATUM). ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY, ENZYME INHIBITION AND ANTI-MICROBIAL EFFECTS WERE TESTED FOR BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION WAS IDENTIFIED BY HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC) (FOR PHENOLIC) AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-FLAME IOANIZATION DETECTOR (GC-FID) (FOR FATTY ACIDS). BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, THE SPECIES MAY BE VALUABLE FOR DESIGNING NOVEL FOOD PRODUCTS.
c("Josephine Shenouda", "Paula Green", "Lester Sultatos") An evaluation of the inhibition of human butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase by the organophosphate chlorpyrifos oxon Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 0041-008X 241 135-142 2009 10.1016/j.taap.2009.08.014 Acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) and butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) are enzymes that belong to the superfamily of Œ±/Œ≤-hydrolase fold proteins. While they share many characteristics, they also possess many important differences. For example, whereas they have about 54% amino acid sequence identity, the active site gorge of acetylcholinesterase is considerably smaller than that of butyrylcholinesterase. Moreover, both have been shown to display simple and complex kinetic mechanisms, depending on the particular substrate examined, the substrate concentration, and incubation conditions. In the current study, incubation of butyrylthiocholine in a concentration range of 0.005‚Äì3.0¬ mM, with 317 pM human butyrylcholinesterase in vitro, resulted in rates of production of thiocholine that were accurately described by simple Michaelis‚ÄìMenten kinetics, with a Km of 0.10¬ mM. Similarly, the inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase in vitro by the organophosphate chlorpyrifos oxon was described by simple Michaelis‚ÄìMenten kinetics, with a ki of 3048¬ nM‚àí1 h‚àí1, and a KD of 2.02¬ nM. In contrast to inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase, inhibition of human acetylcholinesterase by chlorpyrifos oxon in vitro followed concentration-dependent inhibition kinetics, with the ki increasing as the inhibitor concentration decreased. Chlorpyrifos oxon concentrations of 10¬ and 0.3¬ nM gave kis of 1.2¬ and 19.3¬ nM‚àí1 h‚àí1, respectively. Although the mechanism of concentration-dependent inhibition kinetics is not known, the much smaller, more restrictive active site gorge of acetylcholinesterase almost certainly plays a role. Similarly, the much larger active site gorge of butyrylcholinesterase likely contributes to its much greater reactivity towards chlorpyrifos oxon, compared to acetylcholinesterase.

The loss of cholinergic function in the central nervous system contributes to the cognitive decline associated with advanced age and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibitions assays represent a significant role in the drug discovery process. Herein, we describe an improved label free method to screen and characterize new BChE ligands. The liquid chromatography system uses an immobilized capillary enzyme reactor (ICER) as a low affinity and high selectivity column coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS). The enzyme activity was evaluated by monitoring the choline's precursor ion [M + H]+ m/z 104 for a brief period. The method was validated using two known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and galanthamine. The IC50 values were 0.03‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.006‚ÄØŒºM and 0.88‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.2 for tacrine and galanthamine respectively, and Ki was 0.11‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.2 for galanthamine. The efficient combination of the huBChE-ICER with sensitive enzymatic assay detection such as MS, improved the reliable, fast identification of new ligands. Moreover, specific direct quantitation of the product contributes to the reduction of false positive and negative results.

ACS CHEM NEUROSCI 1948-7193 11 3346-3357 2020 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00464 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) IS A COMPLEX NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDER AFFECTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. THE UNDERLYING PATHOLOGIC MECHANISMS OF AD ARE UNCLEAR. OVER THE DECADES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SINGLE TARGET AGENT DID NOT LEAD TO ANY SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT FOR AD. A MULTITARGET AGENT THAT COULD TACKLE MORE THAN ONE AD PHENOTYPE MAY BE HELPFUL AS A TREATMENT STRATEGY. CHOLINESTERASES (CHES) INCLUDING ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), ARE CURRENTLY THE DRUG TARGETS WITH APPROVED TREATMENTS. MOREOVER, AMYLOID BETA (AŒ≤) DEPOSITION IS A HALLMARK OF AD THAT RECEIVES CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION. HEREIN,  , A PREVIOUSLY REPORTED DUAL TARGET INHIBITOR DEALING WITH CHOLINERGIC DYSFUNCTION AND AMYLOID DEPOSITION FOR AD TREATMENT, HAS UNDERGONE THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS.   STUDIES REVEALED THAT   EXHIBITED OVER 80% INHIBITION OF CHE ACTIVITY AT 100 ŒºM AND MORE THAN 30% INHIBITION OF AŒ≤ AGGREGATION AT 1 MM CONCENTRATION. MOREOVER   WAS ABLE TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) AND ENHANCE THE CEREBRAL ACETYLCHOLINE LEVEL IN TRIPLE TRANSGENIC AD (3XTG-AD) MICE. FOLLOWING ONE MONTH TREATMENT WITH  , THE AMYLOID BURDEN AND THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN 3XTG-AD MICE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AMELIORATED. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT   TREATMENT MITIGATED SYNAPSE DYSFUNCTION, DECREASED AMYLOIDOGENIC APP PROCESSING, AND REDUCED THE TAU PATHOLOGY IN 3XTG-AD MICE. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT DUAL INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASES AND AŒ≤ AGGREGATION COULD BE A PROMISING APPROACH IN AD TREATMENT.

Possible new roles for these endocannabinoids? Biochimie 0300-9084 93 1584-1591 2011 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.05.024 Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a serine hydrolase biochemically related to the cholinergic enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), is found in many mammalian tissues, such as serum and central nervous system, but its physiological role is still unclear. BChE is an important human plasma esterase, where it has detoxifying roles. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that brain BChE can have a role in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). The endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) and other acylethanolamides (NAEs) are almost ubiquitary molecules and are physiologically present in many tissues, including blood and brain, where they show neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. This paper demonstrates that they are uncompetitive (oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide) or non competitive (anandamide) inhibitors of BChE (Ki in the range 1.32‚Äì7.48nM). On the contrary, NAEs are ineffective on AChE kinetic features. On the basis of the X-ray crystallographic structure of human BChE, and by using flexible docking procedures, an hypothesis on the NAE-BChE interaction is formulated by molecular modeling studies. Our results suggest that anandamide and the other acylethanolamides studied could have a role in the modulation of the physiological actions of BChE.

PLOS ONE 1932-6203 14 E0223781 2019 10.1371/journal.pone.0223781 THE GREEN SYNTHESIS OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES (SNPS) USING PLANT EXTRACTS IS AN ECO-FRIENDLY METHOD. IT IS A SINGLE STEP AND OFFERS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES SUCH AS TIME REDUCING, COST-EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL NON-TOXIC. SILVER NANOPARTICLES ARE A TYPE OF NOBLE METAL NANOPARTICLES AND IT HAS TREMENDOUS APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF DIAGNOSTICS, THERAPEUTICS, ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY, ANTICANCER AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. IN THE PRESENT WORK, THE AQUEOUS EXTRACTS OF AERIAL PARTS OF LAMPRANTHUS COCCINEUS AND MALEPHORA LUTEA F. AIZOACEAE WERE SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES. THE FORMATION OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES WAS EARLY DETECTED BY A COLOR CHANGE FROM PALE YELLOW TO REDDISH-BROWN COLOR AND WAS FURTHER CONFIRMED BY TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (TEM), UV-VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY, FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FTIR) SPECTROSCOPY, DYNAMIC LIGHT SCATTERING (DLS), X-RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD), AND ENERGY-DISPERSIVE X-RAY DIFFRACTION (EDX). THE TEM ANALYSIS OF SHOWED SPHERICAL NANOPARTICLES WITH A MEAN SIZE BETWEEN 12.86 NM AND 28.19 NM AND THE UV- VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY SHOWED ŒªMAX OF 417 NM, WHICH CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF NANOPARTICLES. THE NEUROPROTECTIVE POTENTIAL OF SNPS WAS EVALUATED BY ASSESSING THE ANTIOXIDANT AND CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. METABOLOMIC PROFILING WAS PERFORMED ON METHANOLIC EXTRACTS OF L.

ANTIOXIDANTS (BASEL) 2076-3921 8 NA 2019 10.3390/antiox8080308 IN THIS STUDY, 16 SELECTED EDIBLE FLOWERS WERE EVALUATED FOR THEIR CONTENT OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS (POLYPHENOLS, CAROTENOIDS, TRITERPENOIDS) AND FOR THEIR ANTI-DIABETIC (ABILITY TO INHIBIT Œ±-AMYLASE AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASES) AND ANTI-AGING (ABILITY TO INHIBIT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE) ACTIVITIES. MOST OF THE FLOWERS ANALYZED IN THIS STUDY HAVE NOT BEEN EXAMINED IN THIS RESPECT UNTIL NOW. CONTENTS OF THE ANALYZED BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG THE FLOWERS. IN PARTICULAR, THE HIGHEST CONTENTS OF CAROTENOIDS AND TRITERPENOIDS WERE DETERMINED IN MARIGOLD, ARNICA, LAVENDER, AND DAISY; IN TURN, THE HIGHEST CONTENTS OF PHENOLIC ACIDS, PROCYANIDIN POLYMERS, AND TOTAL POLYPHENOLS WERE ASSAYED IN HAWTHORN, PRIMROSE, AND LINDEN BLOSSOM. THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CONTENT OF ISOPRENOIDS IN EDIBLE FLOWERS AND THEIR ANTI-AGING ACTIVITY, AND BETWEEN THE CONTENT OF POLYMERIC PROCYANIDINS AND FLOWERS' ABILITY TO INHIBIT Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE. IN CONCLUSION, EDIBLE FLOWERS MAY BE USED TO PRODUCE FUNCTIONAL FOODS AS WELL AS FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES.

In search of effective antibacterial agents, the spiro[indoline3,9-xanthene]-trione (A) and hydroxy-spiro[indoline-3,9-xanthene]-trione (B), were synthesized and tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro and in silico for their anticholinesterase activities. The anticholinesterase activities for six substitutes of the hydroxy derivative (B1-B6) were also studied through the molecular docking. All concentrations of compounds presented a dose-dependent antibacterial activity. The docking results showed that all compounds are more constant than the galantamine. Amongst, compound B1 exhibited the minimum binding energy in both AChE and BChE enzymes. Results indicate the importance of xanthene derivatives as potential antibacterial and anticholinesterases agents.

Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a multifunctional enzyme, its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases has been well established. Anticeramide antibody (Ab-Cer) and enzyme BChE have been implicated in peripheral neuropathies. The present study investigates whether there is an association between Ab-Cer and BChE activities and peripheral neuropathies. Patients included: human immunodeficiency virus associated peripheral neuropathy (HIV-PN, n=39), paucibacillary leprosy (PB-L, n=36), multibacillary leprosy (MB-L, n=52), diabetic neuropathy (DN, n=22), demyelinating sensory motor polyneuropathy (DSMN, n=13) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP, n=10). Plasma Ab-Cer was measured by indirect enzyme linked immune assay (ELISA) and BChE activity in plasma was measured by colorimetric method. Ab-Cer levels were significantly elevated in MB-L and DN as compared to healthy subjects (HS). BChE levels were significantly higher in MB-L and DN as well as in HIV and HIV-PN. There is no significant difference in either Ab-Cer or BChE levels in DSMN and CIDP. Elevated plasma Ab-Cer and BChE levels may be considered significant in the pathogenesis of neuropathies. The variation in concurrent involvement of both the molecules in the neuropathies of the study, suggest their unique involvement in neurodegenerative pathways.

CHOLINERGIC NEURONS OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX OF AD PATIENTS ARE LOST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY OF CHOLINESTERASE ENZYMES. ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) ARE THE TWO MAJOR CLASSES OF CHOLINESTERASES IN THE MAMMALIAN BRAIN. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OXIDATIVE STRESS IN THE PROGRESSION OF AD IS KNOWN. THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE STRONG CHE INHIBITORS WITH ANTI-OXIDANT ACTIVITY. IN THIS STUDY, 41 ABIETANE DITERPENOIDS HAVE BEEN ASSAYED FOR ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTICHOLINESTERASE (BOTH FOR ACHE AND BUCHE) PROPERTIES IN VITRO, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY ISOLATED FROM SALVIA SPECIES, AND STRUCTURALLY DETERMINED BY SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS, PARTICULARLY INTENSIVE 1D- AND 2DNMR AND MASS EXPERIMENTS. MOLECULAR MODELING STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO RATIONALIZE THE IN VITRO CHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF SEVERAL ABIETANE DITERPENOIDS COMPARED WITH GALANTAMINE. THIRTEEN OUT OF THE TESTED 41 ABIETANE DITERPENOIDS EXHIBITED AT LEAST 50% INHIBITION ON EITHER ACHE OR BUCHE. THE STRONGEST INHIBITORY ACTIVITY WAS OBTAINED FOR BRACTEALINE AGAINST BUCHE (3.43 ŒºM) AND ACHE (33.21 ŒºM) WHILE THE MOST SELECTIVE LIGAND WAS FOUND TO BE HYPARGENIN E AGAINST BUCHE ENZYME (6.93 ŒºM). A FULL CORRELATION WAS NOT FOUND BETWEEN ANTICHOLINESTERASE AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM MOLECULAR MODELLING STUDIES OF HYPARGENIN E AND BRACTEALINE ON ACHE AND BUCHE WERE FOUND TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IN VITRO ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY TESTS. ABIETANE DITERPENOIDS ARE PROMISING MOLECULES FOR THE TREATMENT OF MILD-MODERATE AD.

TEN MILLIMOLAR EACH SAMPLE WAS PREPARED IN A MIXTURE OF ETHANOL AND WATER (1:1 V/V), AND THE INTERACTIONS WITH ACHE, BCHE, AND MAO WERE EVALUATED. STILL, FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTY, ABTS RADICALS SCAVENGING ABILITY AND LIPID PEROXIDATION WERE CARRIED OUT. THE RESULTS REVEALED EUGENOL, BHT, AND BHA INHIBITED ACHE, BCHE, AND MAO ACTIVITIES DOSE-DEPENDENTLY. THOUGH, EUGENOL HAD GREATER INHIBITORY EFFECT AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE ACTIVITIES. ALSO, EUGENOL DEMONSTRATED HIGHER ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL COMPARED TO BHT AND BHA. THE POTENT ENZYMATIC INHIBITORY AND ANTIOXIDANT EFFECTS OF EUGENOL INDICATE EUGENOL COULD BE PROMISING AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOOD ADDITIVE AND NEUROMODULATOR IN AD MANAGEMENT. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: BHT AND BHA ARE SYNTHETIC ANTIOXIDANT EMPLOYED INDUSTRIALLY AS FOOD PRESERVATIVE. BHT AND BHA ARE EMPLOYED IN FOOD PACKAGING, DRUGS, AND COSMETICS. ALTHOUGH BHT AND BHA ARE WIDELY IN USE BUT HAVE BEEN FOUND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERATION IN SLEEPING, INDUCED CHANGES IN BRAIN SEROTONIN AND NOREPINEPHRINE LEVELS WITH INCREASED CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY. ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING EFFECTS, REPRODUCTIVE DISORDER IS MORE SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF BHT AND BHA. HOWEVER, EUGENOL A NATURAL COMPOUND FOUND IN PLANTS COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH BHT AND BHA AS ANTIOXIDANT WITH MANY MORE HEALTH PROMOTING BENEFITS SUCH AS NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS, ANTIAPOPTOTIC EFFECTS, AND PREVENT ALUMINUM TOXICITY. EUGENOL BEING A NATURAL ANTIOXIDANT WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS SHOWING MORE PROMISING EFFECTS OVER THE SYNTHETIC PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS AND COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE BHT AND BHA.

MOL INFORM 1868-1751 39 E1900125 2019 10.1002/minf.201900125 ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE THAT AFFECTS THE ELDERLY POPULATION AND CAUSES MEMORY IMPAIRMENT AND COGNITIVE DEFICIT. MANIFESTATION OF THIS DISEASE IS ASSOCIATED TO ACETYLCHOLINE DECREASE; THUS, CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION IS THE MAIN THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, A SERIES OF APORPHINOID ALKALOIDS WERE TESTED AS POTENTIAL ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INHIBITORS IN¬ÄÖVITRO. ALKALOIDS LIRIODENINE (3) AND CASSYTHICINE (10) WERE THE BEST INHIBITORS OF BOTH CHOLINESTERASES WITH IC  VALUES LOWER THAN 10¬ÄÖŒºM. IN ADDITION, THESE ALKALOIDS DEMONSTRATED BETTER INHIBITION OF BCHE THAN REFERENCE DRUG GALANTAMINE. IN ADDITION, SOME ALKALOIDS SHOWED SELECTIVE INHIBITION. LAUROTETATINE CLORHYDRATE (13) SELECTIVELY INHIBIT ACHE OVER BCHE. ON THE CONTRARY, PACHYCONFINE (7) INTERACTED MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH BCHE ACTIVE SITE. MOLECULAR MODELLING STUDIES WERE PERFORMED IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE KEY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOST ACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND THE ENZYMES AND TO EXPLAIN THEIR SELECTIVITY. THESE STUDIES REVEAL THAT THE BENZODIOXOLE MOIETY EXHIBITS STRONG INTERACTIONS DUE TO HYDROGEN BONDS THAT FORM WITH THE GLU201 (ACHE) AND TYR440 (BCHE) RESIDUES, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE IC  VALUES.

IN ADDITION, CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE RESULTS OF THIS SCORE AND A PANEL OF SALIVARY BIOMARKERS AND SEVERITY OF DISEASE WERE STUDIED. THIS PANEL INCLUDED BIOMARKERS OF STRESS (CORTISOL, SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE (SAA), TOTAL ESTERASE ACTIVITY (TEA), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND LIPASE (LIP)), IMMUNITY (ADENOSINE DEAMINASE ISOZYMES 1 (ADA1) AND 2 (ADA2)) AND OXIDATIVE STATUS (URIC ACID (UA), TROLOX EQUIVALENT ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (TEAC), CUPRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (CUPRAC), FERRIC REDUCING ABILITY OF SALIVA (FRAS), ADVANCED OXIDATION PROTEIN PRODUCTS (AOPP) AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H O )). BASED ON THEIR SCORE, DISEASED ANIMALS WERE SUBDIVIDED IN THOSE WITHOUT AND WITH EVIDENT PAIN. LAME PIGS AND PROLAPSED PIGS WITH PAIN SHOWED HIGHER SALIVARY LEVELS OF CORTISOL, SAA, TEA, BCHE, ADA1 AND ADA2 COMPARED WITH THE HEALTHY PIGS. IN ADDITION, THE PROLAPSED PIGS WITH PAIN SHOWED HIGHER LEVELS OF FRAS, AOPP AND H O  COMPARED WITH THE HEALTHY ANIMALS. SALIVARY CORTISOL, TEA, BCHE, ADA ISOZYMES 1 AND 2, FRAS AND AOPP CORRELATED WITH THE PAIN SCORE. THIS FIVE-POINT PAIN SCORE SYSTEM CAN BE EASILY APPLIED TO LAME AND PROLAPSED PIGS, AND SALIVARY BIOMARKERS COULD BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL FOR PAIN ASSESSMENT IN THOSE PIGS.

J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 43 E12870 2018 10.1111/jfbc.12870 IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATED THE ANTI-AMYLOIDOGENIC, ANTICHOLINESTERASE, AND ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIALS OF HYDROETHANOLIC EXTRACTS OF ECKLONIA MAXIMA (ECK), GELIDIUM PRISTOIDES (GLD), GRACILARIA GRACILIS (GCL), AND ULVA LACTUCA (ULT). THE EFFECT OF THE EXTRACTS ON Œ≤-AMYLOID (AŒ≤  ) PEPTIDE WERE DETERMINED USING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. THE EFFECTS OF THE EXTRACTS ON Œ≤-SECRETASE AND CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THEIR RADICAL SCAVENGING AND METAL CHELATING ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO ASSESSED. ELECTRON MICROGRAPHS REVEALED THAT ECK, GLD, GCL, AND ULT INCUBATED WITH AŒ≤  AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS (0-96¬†HR) SHOWED VERY LOW LEVELS OF FIBRILS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THE EXTRACTS ALSO INHIBITED Œ≤-SECRETASE, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER. FURTHERMORE, THE EXTRACTS SCAVENGED HYDROXYL RADICALS AND WERE ABLE TO CHELATE FE  IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE SEAWEED EXTRACTS ARE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF LEAD COMPOUNDS AND NOVEL INHIBITORS OF Œ≤-AMYLOID AGGREGATION, Œ≤-SECRETASE, AND CHOLINESTERASES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASES. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SEAWEEDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS GOOD SOURCES OF NATURALLY OCCURRING BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS WITH SEVERAL MEDICINAL PROPERTIES. THEY ARE COMMONLY USED AS FUNCTIONAL FOODS AND DEVELOPMENT OF NUTRACEUTICALS, DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS, AND COSMECEUTICALS. HOWEVER, THE NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF MANY SPECIES OF SEAWEEDS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT GRACILARIA GRACILIS, ULVA LACTUCA, ECKLONIA MAXIMA, AND GELIDIUM PRISTOIDES ARE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF CHOLINESTERASE, BETA-SECRETASE, AND AMYLOID PROTEIN AGGREGATION INHIBITORS. HENCE, THIS SUPPORT THE USE OF THESE SEAWEEDS AS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ANTIOXIDANTS AND NATURAL COMPOUNDS WITH NEUROPROTECTIVE POTENTIALS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

THE OBSERVED CHES ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS NUCLEAR AND CELLULAR/CYTOPLASMIC ABNORMALITIES REVEALED THAT ELEONORA'S FALCONS ARE LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO CHEMICAL AGENTS WITH NEUROTOXIC AND CYTO-GENOTOXIC POTENTIAL YEAR ROUND, WHILE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THEIR BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY, SUCH AS THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS, COULD MEDIATE THEIR LEVELS. ALTHOUGH WE ENCOURAGE MORE SAMPLING CAMPAIGNS TO VERIFY THE IDENTIFIED SEASONAL AND INTRINSIC SOURCES OF VARIATION IN BIOMARKERS TESTED, THE CURRENT STUDY ENRICHES THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR USEFULNESS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND RISK ASSESSMENT OF MIGRATORY BIRDS, LIKE ELEONORAS' FALCON.

J ENVIRON SCI HEALTH B 1532-4109 55 355-360 2019 10.1080/03601234.2019.1704608 THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE DNA DAMAGE IN SOYBEAN GROWERS DURING TWO AGRICULTURAL PERIODS OF A CROP SEASON (HIGH AND LOW EXPOSURE) AND A CONTROL GROUP, AS WELL AS BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITY DURING THESE EXPOSURE PERIODS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE DEGREE OF BCHE INHIBITION FOR THE EXPOSED GROUP. DNA DAMAGE IN PERIPHERAL WHOLE BLOOD WAS EVALUATED BY THE COMET ASSAY AND PLASMA BCHE ACTIVITY WAS ACCESSED AS A MEASURE OF EXPOSURE TO CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. NONE OF THE SOYBEAN GROWERS REPORTED USING FULL PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE). BCHE WAS LOWER IN HIGH EXPOSURE PERIOD THAN IN LOW EXPOSURE PERIOD AND DNA DAMAGE INDEX WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE HIGH EXPOSURE PERIOD THAN IN THE LOW EXPOSURE PERIOD. IN ADDITION, DNA DAMAGE IN BOTH EXPOSURE PERIODS WAS HIGHER THAN CONTROL GROUP. NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN EXPOSURE TIME AND DNA DAMAGE AND BCHE ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, NEGATIVE CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN DNA DAMAGE IN HIGH AND LOW EXPOSURE PERIODS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT SOYBEAN GROWERS ARE EXPOSED TO CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS AND TO PESTICIDES MIXTURES WITH GENOTOXIC POTENTIAL.
HWANG H;KIM YJ;SHIN Y ASSESSMENT OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL QUALITY, ANTIOXIDANT CONTENT AND ACTIVITY, AND INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASE BETWEEN UNRIPE AND RIPE BLUEBERRY FRUIT. FOODS 2304-8158 9 NA 2020 10.3390/foods9060690 FIVE KOREAN BLUEBERRIES (''NELSON'', ''DUKE '', ''BLUEJAY '', ''TORO'', AND ''ELLIOT '') WERE HARVESTED AT TWO MATURITY STAGES (UNRIPE AND RIPE) TO EVALUATE FRUIT QUALITY AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES. THE HUNTER L, A, AND B COLOR OF RIPE BLUEBERRIES WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF UNRIPE FRUIT. SOLUBLE SOLID CONCENTRATION (SSC) AND PH INCREASED, AND TITRATABLE ACIDITY (TA) AND FIRMNESS DECREASED AS THE BLUEBERRIES MATURED. THE RIPE BLUEBERRY FRUITS SHOWED A HIGHER SSC/TA RATIO THAN THE UNRIPE FRUITS. ALTHOUGH TOTAL ANTHOCYANIN, FLAVONOIDS, PHENOLICS CONTENT, AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WERE HIGHER IN RIPE BLUEBERRIES THAN IN UNRIPE FRUIT, THE UNRIPE FRUIT HAD HIGHER ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INHIBITION ACTIVITIES THAN RIPE FRUIT IN ALL CULTIVARS. TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WAS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH TOTAL FLAVONOIDS AND PHENOLICS. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY AND THE ACHE OR BCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY ARE NEGATIVE. THERE WERE SEVERAL PHYSICOCHEMICAL QUALITY AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY DIFFERENCES IN BLUEBERRIES, DEPENDING ON THE CULTIVAR AND THE MATURITY AT HARVEST. UNRIPE FRUITS ALSO CONTAIN POTENTIAL HEALTH-PROMOTING BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AS FUNCTIONAL FOOD INGREDIENTS.

PESTICIDES USE IS REGULATED FOR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE BUT THERE IS NO REGULATION REGARDING EXPOSURE TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. TO RELATE EXPOSURE TO CHOLINESTERASE'S INHIBITOR PESTICIDES DURING THE SPRAY SEASON WITH NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT IN OCCUPATIONALLY EXPOSED (OE) AND ENVIRONMENTALLY EXPOSED (EE) GROUPS OF PEOPLE. EXPOSURE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITY AND NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED THROUGH A LARGE BATTERY OF TESTS COVERING GENERAL MENTAL STATUS, LANGUAGE, MEMORY, ATTENTION, EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, PRAXIS AND PSYCHOMOTRICITY. EVALUATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT FIRSTLY IN A PERIOD OF NO/LOW ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDE USE AND SUBSEQUENTLY DURING THE SPRAY SEASON. ALL PARAMETERS WERE CALCULATED AS THE RELATIVE CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO SPRAY SEASON. FOR THIS STUDY IN TOTAL 156 PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED DIVIDED EQUALLY OVER PARTICIPANTS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES (EE) AND PARTICIPANTS WITH OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE (OE). IN THE EE, BCHE'S ENZYME ACTIVITY INHIBITION ¬â•30% SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WITH 10% OR MORE DECREASED PERFORMANCE IN SEVERAL TESTS EVALUATING SIX OF THE EIGHT COGNITIVE AREAS (EXCEPTING PSYCHOMOTRICITY AND MOOD STATUS); BESIDES, FOR ACHE INHIBITION IN EE, THE ASSOCIATION WAS SIGNIFICANT IN THREE TESTS EVALUATING ATTENTION AND ONE OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION. WHEREAS, IN OE, THE INHIBITION OF THE BCHE ¬â•30% WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW PERFORMANCE OF ONE ATTENTION TEST AND FOR ACHE THE EXCEEDANCE OF THE STANDARD WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DIMINISHED PERFORMANCE IN ONE TEST OF MEMORY AND ATTENTION, RESPECTIVELY. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BIOMARKERS OF BIOLOGICAL EFFECT AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT PERSISTED AMONG THE EE GROUP AFTER REMOVING CONFOUNDERS. NO ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN BIOMARKERS OF BIOLOGICAL ACUTE EFFECT AND DECREASED COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE OE GROUP. INCREASED EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES WAS CONFIRMED BY INCREASED INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASE'S IN BOTH EXPOSURE GROUPS; WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DIMINISHED NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE, MAINLY IN THE ENVIRONMENTALLY EXPOSED STUDY GROUP.

This is done by developing a circulating system to be close as much as possible to the human circulation using human serum as a source of the enzyme with adjusted pH, isotonicity and temperature to give the maximum affinity of the enzyme towards its substrate (bambuterol). The experiment was running continuously for 90‚ÄØmin to monitor the production of terbutaline from the zero time of its appearance with a measured spectrum in each minute using ZnSe prism. The method was selective and successful for determination of Vmax to be 8.16‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚àí8‚ÄØmol/min/ml and Km to be 2.28‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚àí5‚ÄØmol, showing high affinity of the enzyme towards its prodrug substrate Bambuterol. This study critically probes the quantitative ability of the ATR-FTIR method for terbutaline, which was validated according to ICH guidelines showing high accuracy 100.39% and high selectivity towards the produced terbutaline, as the produced spectrums considered as fingerprint of each compound.

THE RESEARCH STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE UNDERLYING MOLECULAR SIGNALING INVOLVED IN THE NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF CYCLOPENTANONE DERIVATIVE I.E., 2-(HYDROXYL-(3-NITROPHENYL)METHYL)CYCLOPENTANONE (3NCP) AS A THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR AD. IN THIS STUDY, IN VIVO STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT ON A WELL-KNOWN 5XFAD MICE MODEL USING DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURAL TEST MODELS SUCH AS OPEN FIELD, ROTAROD, MORRIS WATER MAZE (MWM), AND Y-MAZE TESTS. FURTHERMORE, IN VITRO CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION ACTIVITY ASSAYS WERE CARRIED OUT. THE FRONTAL CORTEX (FC) AND HIPPOCAMPUS (HC) HOMOGENATES WERE TESTED FOR THE LEVELS/ACTIVITIES OF CHOLINESTERASES, GLUTATHIONE (GSH), GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (GST), AND CATALASE. FURTHERMORE, THE HIPPOCAMPAL EXPRESSION OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES WAS OBSERVED VIA RT-PCR AND WESTERN BLOT. THE RESULTS OF IN VIVO STUDIES SHOW AN ENHANCEMENT IN THE LEARNING BEHAVIOR. THE 3NCP TREATMENT REDUCED LATENCY TIME IN MWM AND Y-MAZE TESTS, ALSO INCREASE SPONTANEOUS ALTERNATION INDICATE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF 3NCP ON MEMORY. FURTHERMORE, OPEN FIELD AND ROTAROD STUDIES REVEALED THAT 3NCP DOES NOT CAUSE MOTOR COORDINATION DEFICIT. THE RESULTS OF THE IN VITRO STUDIES REVEALED THAT THE IC  VALUES OF THE 3NCP AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ( ) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ( ) WERE 16.17 AND 20.51 ¬µG/ML, RESPECTIVELY. THIS DECLINE IN   AND   WAS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY EX VIVO STUDIES. FURTHER, THE 3NCP MITIGATES THE GSH LEVEL, GST, AND CATALASE ACTIVITIES IN HC AND FC. THE MRNA AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES (IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, TNF-Œ±) MARKEDLY DECLINED IN RT-PCR AND WESTERN BLOTTING. THE RESULTS OF THE CURRENT STUDY CONCLUSIVELY DEMONSTRATE THAT 3NCP REDUCES OXIDATIVE STRESS AND MITIGATES NEUROINFLAMMATION IN 5XFAD MICE, IMPLYING THAT 3NCP MAY BE A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATE FOR AD TREATMENT IN THE FUTURE.

APPROXIMATELY 20% OF AAWR CASES OCCUR DURING EMERGENCE FROM ANESTHESIA. CLINICALLY, THESE UNEXPECTED EXPERIENCES ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH DISTRESS ESPECIALLY DUE TO A SENSE OF PARALYSIS. INDEED, ALTHOUGH AAWR AT THE EMERGENCE HAS MULTIPLE CAUSES, IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES THE COMPLICATION DEVELOPS WHEN THE ANESTHESIA PLAN IS TOO EARLY LIGHTENED AT THE END OF ANESTHESIA AND THERE IS A LACK OF USE, OR MISUSE, OF NEUROMUSCULAR MONITORING WITH IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCK. BECAUSE THE DISTRESS CAUSED BY THE SENSE OF PARALYSIS REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS, THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHENOMENON, AND THE POSSIBLE STRATEGIES FOR ITS PROPHYLAXIS ARE ASPECTS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE. NEVERTHELESS, A LIMITED PERCENTAGE OF EPISODES OF AAWR CANNOT BE PREVENTED. THIS PARADOX HOLDS ALSO DURING THE EMERGENCE PHASE OF ANESTHESIA WHICH REPRESENTS A VERY COMPLEX NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS WITH MANY ASPECTS YET TO BE CLARIFIED.

MOREOVER, THE POSSIBLE MODULATION BY BEE VENOM OF THE EFFECT OF L-DOPA/CARBIDOPA OR RASAGILINE WAS EXAMINED. ROTENONE (1.5 MG/KG, SUBCUTANEOUSLY; SC) WAS ADMINISTERED EVERY OTHER DAY FOR TWO WEEKS AND AT THE SAME TIME MICE RECEIVED THE VEHICLE (DMSO, SC), BEE VENOM (0.065, 0.13, AND 0.26 MG/KG; INTRADERMAL; ID), L-DOPA/CARBIDOPA (25 MG/KG, INTRAPERITONEAL; IP), L-DOPA/CARBIDOPA+BEE VENOM (0.13 MG/KG, ID), RASAGILINE (1 MG/KG, IP) OR RASAGILINE+BEE VENOM (0.13 MG/KG, ID). THEN, WIRE HANGING AND STAIRCASE TESTS WERE PERFORMED AND MICE WERE EUTHANIZED AND BRAINS' STRIATA SEPARATED. OXIDATIVE STRESS BIOMARKERS NAMELY, MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA), NITRIC OXIDE (NO), REDUCED GLUTATHIONE (GSH), PARAOXONASE-1 (PON-1), AND TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (TAC) WERE MEASURED. ADDITIONALLY, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN-1 (MCP-1), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-Œ±), AND DOPAMINE (DA) WERE EVALUATED. BRAIN HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES AND CASPASE-3- EXPRESSION WERE DONE. BEE VENOM SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED MOTOR PERFORMANCE AND INHIBITED ROTENONE-INDUCED OXIDATIVE/NITROSATIVE STRESS, OBSERVED AS A REDUCTION IN BOTH MDA AND NO ALONG WITH INCREASING GSH, PON-1, AND TAC. BESIDES, BEE VENOM DECREASED MCP-1, TNF-Œ±, AND CASPASE-3 EXPRESSION TOGETHER WITH AN INCREASE IN BUCHE ACTIVITY AND DA CONTENT. BEE VENOM ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH L-DOPA/CARBIDOPA OR RASAGILINE ALLEVIATED NEURONAL DEGENERATION COMPARED WITH L-DOPA/CARBIDOPA OR RASAGILINE TREATMENT ONLY. BEE VENOM VIA ITS ANTIOXIDANT AND CYTOKINE REDUCING POTENTIALS MIGHT BE OF VALUE EITHER ALONE OR AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PD.

MUSCLE STRENGTH WAS ASSESSED WITH HANDGRIP STRENGTH (JAMAR'S DYNAMOMETER). SARCOPENIA WAS DEFINED BY HAVING BOTH LOW MUSCLE MASS AND STRENGTH AND USING THE EUROPEAN WORKING GROUP ON SARCOPENIA IN OLDER PEOPLE 2 DEFINITION OF PROBABLE SARCOPENIA (LOW GRIP STRENGTH). PERIPHERAL MARKERS-PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND OXIDATIVE STRESS PARAMETERS-WERE DETERMINED EITHER IN THE PLASMA OR IN THE ERYTHROCYTE FRACTION OBTAINED FROM PERIPHERAL WHOLE BLOOD OF EVERY PATIENT PRE-OPERATIVELY. MEAN AGE WAS 87.6 ¬± 4.9 YEARS, AND 78.7% WERE WOMEN. THE PREVALENCE OF SARCOPENIA WAS 11.5% WITH JANSSEN'S, 34.9% WITH MASAN√©S' CUT-OFFS, AND 93.3% WITH THE EUROPEAN WORKING GROUP ON SARCOPENIA IN OLDER PEOPLE 2 DEFINITION OF PROBABLE SARCOPENIA. AMONG THE FOUR PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES TESTED IN PLASMA, ONLY TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR-Œ± WAS DIFFERENT (LOWER) IN SARCOPENIC THAN IN NON-SARCOPENIC PARTICIPANTS USING BOTH MUSCLE MASS CUT-OFFS (J 7.9 ¬± 6.2 VS. 8.3 ¬± 5.8, M 6.8 ¬± 4.7 VS. 9.1 ¬± 6.2). ERYTHROCYTE GLUTATHIONE SYSTEM SHOWED A NON-SIGNIFICANT TENDENCY TO LOWER GLUTATHIONE LEVELS AND GLUTATHIONE/OXIDIZED GLUTATHIONE RATIOS IN SARCOPENIC PARTICIPANTS COMPARED WITH NON-SARCOPENIC SUBJECTS. CATALASE ACTIVITY WAS ALSO LOWER IN SARCOPENIC PARTICIPANTS (J 2904 ¬± 1429 VS. 3329 ¬± 1483, M 3037 ¬± 1430 VS. 3431 ¬± 1498). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN GROUPS IN CHYMOTRYPSIN-LIKE ACTIVITY OF THE 20S PROTEASOME, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY, C-TERMINAL AGRIN FRAGMENT, INTERFERON-Œ≥, OR INTERLEUKIN-1Œ≤. THE PREVALENCE OF SARCOPENIA IN PATIENTS WITH HIP FRACTURE VARIES ACCORDING TO THE DEFINITION AND THE MUSCLE MASS REFERENCE CUT-OFF POINTS USED. WE DID NOT FIND DIFFERENCES IN MOST NEUROMUSCULAR, PRO-INFLAMMATORY, OR OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS, EXCEPT FOR LOWER PERIPHERAL TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR-Œ± LEVELS AND CATALASE ACTIVITY IN SARCOPENIC PARTICIPANTS, WHICH MAY BE MARKERS OF AN EARLY INFLAMMATORY REACTION THAT IS HAMPERED IN SARCOPENIC PATIENTS.

THE PATHOGENESIS OF ENDOMETRITIS IN COWS IS STILL NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD. THE COMBINED ANALYSIS OF THE MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE MECHANISMS, BUT IS STILL UNEXPLORED IN UTERINE DISORDERS. MOREOVER, RESEARCH PROVIDES EVIDENCE ABOUT AN IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE VAGUS NERVE IN REGULATING THE INNATE IMMUNE FUNCTION THROUGH THE CHOLINERGIC ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PATHWAY IN RESPONSE TO BACTERIAL INFECTIONS. THIS NEW PATHWAY HAS DEMONSTRATED A CRITICAL ROLE IN CONTROLLING THE INFLAMMATORY SYSTEM. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE ACTIVITY OF CHOLINESTERASE IN TOTAL BLOOD, LYMPHOCYTES, AND SERUM OF DAIRY COWS WITH CLINICAL AND SUBCLINICAL ENDOMETRITIS. SIXTY-ONE HOLSTEIN COWS, BETWEEN 30 AND 45 DAYS IN MILK, WERE CLASSIFIED INTO 3 GROUPS OF ANIMALS: PRESENTING CLINICAL ENDOMETRITIS (N = 22), SUBCLINICAL ENDOMETRITIS (N = 17), AND HEALTHY (N = 22). MEAN LEUKOCYTE COUNTS DID NOT DIFFER AMONG GROUPS, BUT THE NEUTROPHIL NUMBER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN COWS WITH CLINICAL ENDOMETRITIS THAN THOSE IN HEALTHY ANIMALS. ALSO, SERUM CONCENTRATION OF INTERLEUKIN-1BETA (PG/ML) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN COWS WITH ENDOMETRITIS. THE ACTIVITY OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE IN BLOOD AND LYMPHOCYTES INCREASED IN BOTH GROUPS WITH ENDOMETRITIS. ANIMALS WITH ENDOMETRITIS PRESENTED AN INCREASE IN LIPID PEROXIDATION, BUT THE ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITY (CATALASE LEVELS) WAS HIGHER IN ENDOMETRITIS GROUPS THAN IN NORMAL COWS. IN CONCLUSION, THE INFLAMMATORY PROCESS OF CLINICAL AND SUBCLINICAL ENDOMETRITIS LEADS TO SYSTEMIC LIPID PEROXIDATION DESPITE THE COMPENSATORY INCREASE OF THE ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME. THESE DATA ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF AN IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE CHOLINERGIC PATHWAY IN REGULATING DAIRY COWS WITH CLINICAL AND SUBCLINICAL ENDOMETRITIS.

ARCH PHYSIOL BIOCHEM 1744-4160 NA 1-8 2020 10.1080/13813455.2020.1743723 IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF NATIVE FRUIT EXTRACTS ON INFLAMMATORY AND THROMBOREGULATORY PARAMETERS IN ANIMAL MODEL OF METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) INDUCED BY HIGHLY PALATABLE DIET (HPD). RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO 4 EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS: STANDARD CHOW, HPD, HPD AND   EXTRACT, AND HPD AND   EXTRACT. HPD INCREASED SERUM INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6) LEVELS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS CHANGE WAS PREVENTED BY EXTRACTS. HPD DECREASED NTPDASE ACTIVITY IN LYMPHOCYTES AND PLATELETS AND 5'-NUCLEOTIDASE IN PLATELETS. TREATMENT WITH EXTRACTS PREVENTED THESE CHANGES. AN INCREASE IN ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA) ACTIVITY WAS PREVENTED BY   IN LYMPHOCYTES AND SERUM OF RATS. FRUIT EXTRACTS PREVENTED THE INCREASE IN THE ACTIVITY OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) IN LYMPHOCYTES AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) IN SERUM INDUCED BY THE HPD. BRAZILIAN NATIVE FRUIT EXTRACTS HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTITHROMBOTIC EFFECTS, DEMONSTRATING THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL IN THE PREVENTION OF COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH METS.

A mouse model, containing five human familial AD genes (5XFAD), also develops AŒ≤ plaques with BChE activity. Knock-out of BChE in this model showed diminished fibrillar AŒ≤ plaque deposition, more so in males than females. This suggests that lack of BChE reduces deposition of fibrillar AŒ≤ in AD and this effect may be influenced by sex.
c("Patrick Masson", "Oksana Lockridge") Butyrylcholinesterase for protection from organophosphorus poisons: Catalytic complexities and hysteretic behavior Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 0003-9861 494 107-120 2010 10.1016/j.abb.2009.12.005 Butyrylcholinesterase is a promiscuous enzyme that displays complex kinetic behavior. It is toxicologically important because it detoxifies organophosphorus poisons (OP) by making a covalent bond with the OP. The OP and the butyrylcholinesterase are both inactivated in the process. Inactivation of butyrylcholinesterase has no adverse effects. However, inactivation of acetylcholinesterase in nerve synapses can be lethal. OP-inhibited butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase can be reactivated with oximes provided the OP has not aged. Strategies for preventing the toxicity of OP include (a) treatment with an OP scavenger, (b) reaction of non-aged enzyme with oximes, (c) reactivation of aged enzyme, (d) slowing down aging with peripheral site ligands, and (e) design of mutants that rapidly hydrolyze OP. Option (a) has progressed through phase I clinical trials with human butyrylcholinesterase. Option (b) is in routine clinical use. The others are at the basic research level. Butyrylcholinesterase displays complex kinetic behavior including activation by positively charged esters, ability to hydrolyze amides, and a lag time (hysteresis) preceding hydrolysis of benzoylcholine and N-methylindoxyl acetate. Mass spectrometry has identified new OP binding motifs on tyrosine and lysine in proteins that have no active site serine. It is proposed, but not yet proven, that low dose exposure involves OP modification of proteins that have no active site serine.

A previously highlighted AChE reactivator, dichlorinated bispyridinium oxime with propyl linker (K868), was tested in more detail for reactivation of four nerve agent-BChE conjugates. Its BChE reactivation potency was showed to be promising when compared to the standard oximes used in medical practice, asoxime (HI-6) and pralidoxime (2-PAM), especially in case of sarin and tabun. This finding could be used in the pseudo-catalytic scavenging of the most nerve agents due to its cumulative capacity to reactivate both AChE and BChE.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCH) LEVEL IN POISONING WITH METAL PHOSPHIDES. IN THIS CASE SERIES STUDY, 60 POISONED PATIENTS WITH ZINC PHOSPHIDE (ZNP) AND ALUMINUM PHOSPHIDE (ALP) WHO WAS ADMITTED TO POISONING WARD IN HAMADAN,¬†IRAN, ENROLLED IN THE STUDY AND BUCH LEVEL WAS MEASURED. THE SEX, AGE, AMOUNT OF INGESTION, TIME OF CONSUMPTION, SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, ECG AND ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS (ABG) CHANGES AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED. MOST (58.3%) PATIENTS WERE MALES, THE MEAN AGE WAS 32.76¬±17.65 YEARS. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF INGESTION WAS 7.5¬±4.6 AND 2.5¬±2.96 GR FOR ZNP AND ALP, RESPECTIVELY. MOST SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS WERE HYPOTENSION (97%), NAUSEA AND VOMITING (82%) AND ABDOMINAL PAIN (32%). THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF BUCH LEVEL IN ALL PATIENTS WAS 5163.25¬±2158.31 U/L, THAT'S WHILE IN ZNP AND ALP POISONED PATIENTS WAS 5608¬±1577 U/L AND 4721.46¬±2562U/L RESPECTIVELY.

In this study the stoichiometric nature of the protection afforded by human butyrylcholinesterase against organophosphorus nerve agents was investigated in guinea pigs. Animals were administered human butyrylcholinesterase (26.15‚ÄØmg/kg‚ÄØ‚â°‚ÄØ308‚ÄØnmol/kg) by the intravascular or intramuscular route. Animals were subsequently dosed with either soman or VX in accordance with a stage-wise adaptive dose design to estimate the modified median lethal dose in treated animals. Human butyrylcholinesterase (308‚ÄØnmol/kg) increased the median lethal dose of soman from 154‚ÄØnmol/kg to 770‚ÄØnmol/kg. Comparing the molar ratio of agent molecules to enzyme active sites yielded a stoichiometric protective ratio of 2:1 for soman, likely related to the similar stereoselectivity the enzyme has compared to the toxic target, acetylcholinesterase. In contrast, human butyrylcholinesterase (308‚ÄØnmol/kg) increased the median lethal dose of VX from 30‚ÄØnmol/kg to 312‚ÄØnmol/kg, resulting in a stoichiometric protective ratio of only 1:1, suggesting a lack of stereoselectivity for this agent.

UNLIKE ITS SISTER ENZYME ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE HAS A BROAD SUBSTRATE SCOPE AND LOWER ACETYLCHOLINE CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY. THE DIFFERENCE IN TISSUE DISTRIBUTION AND INHIBITOR SENSITIVITY ALSO POINTS TO ITS INVOLVEMENT EXTERNAL TO CHOLINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION. INITIAL STUDIES ON BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE SHOWED THAT THE INHIBITION OF THE ENZYME LED TO THE INCREMENT OF BRAIN ACETYLCHOLINE LEVELS. FURTHER GENE KNOCKOUT STUDIES SUGGESTED ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE REGULATION OF AMYLOID-BETA, A BRAIN PATHOGENIC PROTEIN. THUS, IT IS AN INTERESTING TARGET FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. THE SUBSTRATE SCOPE OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE WAS RECENTLY FOUND TO INCLUDE COCAINE, AS WELL AS GHRELIN, THE "HUNGER HORMONE". THESE FINDINGS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECOMBINANT BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE MUTANTS AND VIRAL GENE THERAPY TO COMBAT COCAINE ADDICTION, ALONG WITH IN-DEPTH STUDIES ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE IN OBESITY. IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE PHARMACOLOGICAL IMPACT OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INCREASED IN TANDEM WITH EACH REPORTED FINDING. NOT ONLY IS THE ENZYME NOW CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT PHARMACOLOGICAL TARGET, IT IS ALSO BECOMING AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO STUDY THE BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS IN VARIOUS DISEASES. HERE, WE REVIEW AND SUMMARIZE THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND ITS ROLES, AS A CHOLINERGIC NEUROTRANSMITTER, IN VARIOUS DISEASES, PARTICULARLY NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS.

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHOLINESTERASE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CELLULAR PROLIFERATION, DIFFERENTIATION AND MAY HAVE A POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN TUMOR GROWTH. THE PRESENT STUDY IS AIMED TO DETERMINE THE UTILITY OF SERUM BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) LEVELS AS A MARKER FOR PROGRESSION OF ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (OSCC) IN RELATION TO THE GRADE OF THE TUMOR AND TO DETERMINE IF ANY VARIATION OCCURRED IN THE LEVELS OF BCHE BEFORE AND AFTER THERAPY. A TOTAL OF 120 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS AS GROUP A-30 PATIENTS (HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS) AND GROUP B-90 CASES OF HISTOPATHOLOGICALLY DIAGNOSED OSCC. THE BLOOD SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED BEFORE SURGERY, RE-COLLECTED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF RADIOTHERAPY (I.E., 3 AND 6 MONTHS POSTSURGERY) AND ANALYZED BIOCHEMICALLY FOR THE CONCENTRATION OF BCH. PAIRED T-TEST, ANOVA, AND POST HOC TEST (BONFERRONI) WERE USED FOR DETERMINING THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. BCHE LEVELS WERE LOWER IN OSCC (2940.32-1405.50 U/L WHEN COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (11149.60-11243.07 UNIT/L) AND THIS DIFFERENCE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. POSTOPERATIVELY AT 3 MONTHS, THE SERUM BCHE LEVELS OF OSCC PATIENTS INCREASED ALMOST TWO-FOLD COMPARED TO THE PREOPERATIVE VALUES, AND THIS DIFFERENCE WAS ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.000) AFTER 6 MONTHS, THESE LEVELS FURTHER INCREASED BUT DID NOT REACH THOSE OF CONTROLS. BCHE CAN BE USED AS AN INEXPENSIVE, EASY TO USE, NONINVASIVE BIOMARKER FOR THE EVALUATION OF DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL IN OSCC PATIENTS.

THE CONCURRENT USE OF COCAINE AND ALCOHOL PRODUCES THE PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE METABOLITES COCAETHYLENE AND NORCOCAETHYLENE, IN ADDITION TO NORCOCAINE. BOTH COCAETHYLENE AND NORCOCAETHYLENE ARE MORE TOXIC THAN COCAINE ITSELF. HENCE, A TRULY VALUABLE COCAINE-METABOLIZING ENZYME FOR COCAINE ABUSE/OVERDOSE TREATMENT SHOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE HYDROLYSIS OF NOT ONLY COCAINE, BUT ALSO ITS METABOLITES NORCOCAINE, COCAETHYLENE, AND NORCOCAETHYLENE. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORT ON ENZYMES CAPABLE OF HYDROLYZING NORCOCAETHYLENE (THE MOST TOXIC METABOLITE OF COCAINE).

BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) STOICHIOMETRICALLY BINDS NERVE AGENTS, BUT BECAUSE THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF A NERVE AGENT IS ABOUT 500-FOLD LESS THAN THE ENZYME, THE BIOSCAVENGER HAS HAD LIMITED UTILITY. WE SYNTHESIZED BCHE-POLYMER-OXIME CONJUGATES USING ATOM TRANSFER RADICAL POLYMERIZATION (ATRP) AND AZIDE-ALKYNE "CLICK" CHEMISTRY. THE ACTIVITY OF THE BCHE-POLYMER-OXIME CONJUGATES WAS DEPENDENT ON THE DEGREE OF OXIME LOADING WITHIN THE COPOLYMER SIDE CHAINS. THE COVALENT MODIFICATION OF OXIME-CONTAINING COPOLYMERS PROLONGED THE ACTIVITY OF BCHE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE VX- AND CYCLOSARIN-FLUOROGENIC ANALOGUES EMP-MECYC AND CMP-MECYC, RESPECTIVELY. AFTER COMPLETE INACTIVATION BY VX AND CYCLOSARIN FLUOROGENIC ANALOGUES, THE CONJUGATES DEMONSTRATED EFFICIENT SELF-REACTIVATION OF UP TO 80% WITHIN 3-6 H. REPEATED INHIBITION AND HIGH-LEVEL SELF-REACTIVATION ASSAYS REVEALED THAT THE BCHE-POLYMER-OXIME CONJUGATES WERE EXCELLENT REACTIVATORS OF OPNA-INHIBITED BCHE.

NEUROPHARMACOLOGY 1873-7064 168 108020 2019 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2020.108020 ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) INHIBITORS MODULATE ACETYLCHOLINE HYDROLYSIS AND HENCE PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHOLINERGIC TONE AND IN IMPLEMENTING ITS IMPACT ON THE CHOLINERGIC BLOCKADE OF INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES. SUCH INHIBITORS MAY INCLUDE RAPIDLY ACTING SMALL MOLECULE ACHE-BLOCKING DRUGS AND POISONOUS ANTI-ACHE INSECTICIDES OR WAR AGENT INHIBITORS WHICH PENETRATE BOTH BODY AND BRAIN. NOTABLY, TRAUMATIZED PATIENTS MAY BE HYPER-SENSITIZED TO ANTI-ACHES DUE TO THEIR IMPAIRED CHOLINERGIC TONE, HIGHER LEVELS OF CIRCULATION PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND EXACERBATED PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES. THOSE LARGELY DEPEND ON THE INNATE-IMMUNE SYSTEM YET REACH THE BRAIN VIA VAGUS PATHWAYS AND/OR DISRUPTED BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER. OTHER REGULATORS OF THE NEURO-INFLAMMATORY CASCADE ARE ACHE-TARGETED MICRORNAS (MIRS) AND SYNTHETIC CHEMICALLY PROTECTED OLIGONUCLEOTIDE BLOCKERS THEREOF, WHOSE SIZE PREVENTS DIRECT BRAIN PENETRANCE. NEVERTHELESS, THESE LARGER MOLECULES MAY EXERT PARALLEL ALBEIT SLOWER INFLAMMATORY REGULATING EFFECTS ON BRAIN AND BODY TISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, OLIGONUCLEOTIDE APTAMERS INTERACTING WITH INNATE IMMUNE TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRS) MAY CONTROL INFLAMMATION THROUGH DIVERSE ROUTES AND IN DIFFERENT RATES. SUCH APTAMERS MAY COMPETE WITH THE ACTION OF BOTH SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS AND ACHE-INHIBITING MIRS IN PERIPHERAL TISSUES INCLUDING MUSCLE AND INTESTINE. HOWEVER, RAPID ADAPTATION PROCESSES, VISUALIZED IN NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTIONS ENABLE MURINE SURVIVAL UNDER OTHERWISE LETHAL ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE EXPOSURE; AND BOTH MIR INHIBITORS AND TLR-MODULATING APTAMERS MAY EXERT BODY-BRAIN SIGNALS PROTECTING EXPERIMENTAL MICE FROM ACUTE INFLAMMATION. THE COMPLEX VARIETY OF ACHE INHIBITING MOLECULES IDENTIFIES DIVERSE BODY-BRAIN COMMUNICATION PATHWAYS WHICH MAY RAPIDLY INDUCE LONG-LASTING CENTRAL REACTIONS TO PERIPHERAL STRESSFUL AND INFLAMMATORY INSULTS IN BOTH MICE AND MEN.

BMC ANESTHESIOL 1471-2253 20 246 2020 10.1186/s12871-020-01166-9 POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM (POD) IS A FREQUENT COMPLICATION AFTER SURGERY AND ITS OCCURRENCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR OUTCOMES. THE NEUROPATHOLOGY OF THIS COMPLICATION IS UNCLEAR, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO EVALUATE RELEVANT BIOMARKERS FOR POSTOPERATIVE STATUS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPRESSION LEVELS OF CHOLINERGIC BIOMARKERS IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) AND THE OCCURRENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF POD IN ELDERLY PATIENTS. FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY-TWO ELDERLY PATIENTS AGED 65¬ÄâYEARS OLD OR OLDER WITH ELECTIVE TOTAL HIP/KNEE REPLACEMENT RECEIVED COMBINED SPINAL-EPIDURAL ANESTHESIA. PREOPERATIVE BASELINE COGNITIVE FUNCTION WAS ASSESSED USING THE MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION (MMSE) BEFORE SURGERY. EACH PATIENT WAS INTERVIEWED IN POST-ANESTHESIA CARE UNIT (PACU) AND ON THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND SEVENTH (OR BEFORE DISCHARGE) POSTOPERATIVE DAYS. POD WAS DIAGNOSED USING THE CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD (CAM), AND POD SEVERITY WAS MEASURED USING THE MEMORIAL DELIRIUM ASSESSMENT SCALE (MDAS). PREOPERATIVE CSF AND PLASMA CHOLINE ACETYLTRANSFERASE (CHAT), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6) AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) LEVELS WERE DETERMINED BY ELISA. THE LEVELS OF CHAT, ACHE AND BUCHE ACTIVITIES WERE DETERMINED BY SPECTROPHOTOMETRY. POD WAS DETECTED IN 11.4% (51/447) OF THE PATIENTS. ACHE, BUCHE, CHAT, TNF-Œ± AND IL-6 CONCENTRATIONS IN CSF AND PLASMA HAVE HIGHER CONSISTENCY. IN PREOPERATIVE CSF AND PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE PLASMA, DOWN-REGULATION OF THE CONCENTRATION AND ACTIVITY OF ACHE AND BUCHE AS WELL AS UP-REGULATION OF THE CONCENTRATION AND ACTIVITY OF CHAT AND THE CONCENTRATIONS OF IL-6 AND TNF-Œ± WERE OBSERVED IN PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED POD, AND THE DECREASE IN BUCHE WAS THE MOST OBVIOUS. LOGISTIC ANALYSIS SHOWED THE ACTIVITIES OF CHAT, ACHE AND BUCHE IN CSF WERE STILL RELATED TO POD AFTER ADJUSTING FOR RELATED FACTORS SUCH AS SEX, AGE, YEARS OF EDUCATION, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), AND AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS (ASA) CLASS. RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE AREA UNDER CURVE (AUC) OF ACHE, BUCHE AND CHAT ACTIVITY IN CSF WAS 0.679 (P¬Äâ<¬Äâ0.01), 0.940 (P¬Äâ<¬Äâ0.01) AND 0.819 (P¬Äâ<¬Äâ0.01) RESPECTIVELY AND FOUND THAT BUCHE ACTIVITY HAD THE MOST ACCURATE DIAGNOSTIC VALUE. THE CHANGES IN PREOPERATIVE ACTIVITY OF ACHE, BUCHE AND CHAT IN CSF WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF POD IN ELDERLY PATIENTS, AND BUCHE ACTIVITY HAD THE GREATEST DIAGNOSTIC VALUE, WHICH MAY BE RELATED TO CENTRAL CHOLINERGIC DEGRADATION. THESE CHOLINERGIC BIOMARKERS MIGHT PARTICIPATE IN THE NEUROPATHOLOGY OF POD, PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS. THIS STUDY WAS REGISTERED AT CHICTR.ORG.CN (NO. CHICTR1900023729 ) JUNE 9TH, 2019.

NUTR NEUROSCI 1476-8305 NA 1-12 2020 10.1080/1028415X.2020.1859727 AN ABUNDANT LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT OBESITY-ASSOCIATED WITH TAKING A HIGH FAT DIET IS RELATED TO AN ELEVATED RISK OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND METABOLIC SYNDROME. HOWEVER, METABOLIC DISORDERS MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE INDUCTION OF THE ANXIOGENIC-LIKE SYMPTOMS. THE CURRENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH A HIGH FAT DIET (HFD) CAN CAUSE SEVERAL COMPLICATIONS IN THE WISTAR RATS ( ) BRAIN. OXIDATIVE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION AS WELL AS THE PUTATIVE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY CHAMOMILE DECOCTION EXTRACT (CDE) WERE ALSO STUDIED.THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE INCREASED BODY AND BRAIN WEIGHT, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS HYPERCHOLEZTEROLAEMIA IN RESPONSE TO HFD TAKING WERE CORRELATED WITH ANXIOGENIC-LIKE SYMPTOMS. MOREOVER, HFD FEED CAUSED A BRAIN OXIDATIVE STRESS CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASED LIPOPEROXIDATION, INHIBITION OF ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SOD, CAT AND GPX, DEPLETION OF A NON-ENZYMATIC ANTIOXIDANT SUCH AS SULFHYDRYL GROUPS AND GSH. IMPORTANTLY, THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT HFD ALSO PROVOKED A CEREBRAL OVERLOAD IN REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES SUCH AS OH , H O  AND   AS WELL AS BRAIN INFLAMMATION ASSESSED BY THE OVERPRODUCTION OF CYTOKINES SUCH AS IL-1Œ≤ AND IL-6.INTERESTINGLY, ALL NEUROBEHAVIORAL CHANGES AND ALL THE BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR DISTURBANCES WERE ABOLISHED IN HFD-FED RATS TREATED WITH CDE.OUR RESULTS PROVIDE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT OBESITY AND DEPRESSION AS WELL AS ANXIETY ARE FINELY CORRELATED AND THAT   DECOCTION MAY PROVE TO BE A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC AGENT TO MITIGATE THE BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS, THE BIOCHEMICAL ALTERATIONS AND THE NEUROINFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED TO THE OBESITY.

IN THIS STUDY, OXYTOCIN WAS MEASURED IN SALIVA SAMPLES OF 45 PIGS THAT WERE COLLECTED BEFORE BEING TRANSPORTED TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AT THE TIME OF ARRIVAL AND 4¬ÄØH AFTER ARRIVAL TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE. TWO PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED ASSAYS, ONE THAT MEASURES FREE OXYTOCIN AND OTHER THAT MEASURES OXYTOCIN LINKED TO PROTEINS, WERE USED. IN ADDITION, CORTISOL, SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE (SAA), TOTAL ESTERASE ACTIVITY (TEA), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE (LDH), WHICH ARE BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH STRESS AND PAIN IN PIGS, WERE MEASURED. THE RESULTS SHOWED A DECREASE IN FREE AND PROTEIN-LINKED OXYTOCIN CONCENTRATIONS AT 4¬ÄØH AFTER TRANSPORT COMPARED WITH THE TIME BEFORE TRANSPORT, WHILE CORTISOL, SAA, TEA, BCHE AND LDH SHOWED AN INCREASE AT 4¬ÄØH AFTER TRANSPORT COMPARED WITH THE TIME BEFORE TRANSPORT. BASED ON THESE RESULTS IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE TRANSPORT AND LAIRAGE AT SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN THE CONDITIONS OF THIS STUDY PRODUCE A DECREASE IN OXYTOCIN IN THE SALIVA OF PIGS THAT COULD INDICATE A REDUCED EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING.

ATTEMPTS TO RELATE BEHAVIOURAL PATTERNS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES HAVE NOT ALWAYS GIVEN CLEAR-CUT RESULTS. HERE, WE MEASURED THE CHANGES IN A PANEL OF SALIVARY COMPONENTS: SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE (SAA), LIPASE, TOTAL ESTERASE (TEA), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA), AND CORTISOL, AND THEIR POTENTIAL LINK WITH HORSES' BEHAVIOURS AFTER ACUTE STRESS. SALIVA SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED IN NINE RIDING HORSES SUBJECTED TO A TEST CONSISTING OF OPENING AN UMBRELLA. SALIVA SAMPLING WAS OBTAINED AT A BASAL TIME POINT IN THE STALL (T1), IN THE TEST INDOOR ARENA (T2), AT A TIME OF STRESS (T3), AND 30 MIN (T4) AND 60 MIN (T5) LATER. THE HORSES' BEHAVIOUR WAS RECORDED AT T3 FOR 1 MINUTE. SAA, LIPASE, TEA, AND BCHE SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ALONG TIME, INCREASING AT T3 FOR BCHE, AND DECREASING AT T4 FOR SAA AND BCHE. BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE APPEARED TO BE THE MOST RELIABLE PREDICTOR OF BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES, AS IT CORRELATED WITH THE INDEX OF EMOTIONALITY, OF LATERALITY, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ALARM SIGNALS, WHILE SAA DECREASED WHEN HORSES EXPRESSED QUIETER BEHAVIOURS. THESE FIRST RESULTS BRING PROMISING LINES FOR NOVEL, MORE PRECISE PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF ACUTE STRESS IN HORSES THAT CAN BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN BEHAVIOUR AND PHYSIOLOGY.

ANIMALS (BASEL) 2076-2615 10 NA 2020 10.3390/ani10091486 THIS STUDY AIMS TO EVALUATE THE CIRCADIAN AND CIRCANNUAL VARIATIONS IN A PANEL OF ANALYTES IN HORSE SALIVA THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS BIOMARKERS RELATED TO STRESS AND DISEASE, IN ORDER TO INTERPRET THEM CORRECTLY WHEN THEY ARE MEASURED IN THIS SPECIES. THIS PANEL OF ANALYTES INTEGRATED CORTISOL, SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE (SAA), LIPASE (LIP), TOTAL ESTERASE (TEA), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA), Œ≥-GLUTAMYL TRANSFERASE (GGT), CREATINE KINASE (CK), UREA, TOTAL BILIRUBIN, TOTAL PROTEIN (TP), AND PHOSPHORUS. THESE ANALYTES WERE MEASURED IN SALIVA OBTAINED FROM A POPULATION OF FIVE CLINICALLY HEALTHY MARES FROM 06:30 TO 20:30, EVERY 2 H OVER TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN TWO DIFFERENT PHOTOPERIOD SEASONS, WINTER AND SPRING. THE TEMPERATURE AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY DID NOT CHANGE BETWEEN THE TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS SAMPLED IN EACH SAMPLED SEASON, AND NO THERMAL DISCOMFORT WAS OBSERVED. CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DAY WERE OBSERVED FOR CORTISOL, SAA, TEA, BCHE, ADA, AND CK. HOWEVER, A CIRCADIAN PATTERN WAS ONLY OBSERVED FOR CORTISOL, TEA, BCHE, ADA, AND CK. MOREOVER, THE VALUES OBTAINED FOR SAA, LIP, AND BCHE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN SEASONS, WITH DIFFERENT DAILY RHYTHMS FOR CORTISOL, TEA, BCHE, AND ADA DEPENDING ON THE SEASON. IN CONCLUSION, THIS PILOT STUDY INDICATES THAT THE TIME OF THE DAY AND THE SEASON INFLUENCE SALIVARY ANALYTES IN HORSES, SHOWING A RHYTHMIC PATTERN FOR CORTISOL, TEA, BCHE, ADA, AND CK. THESE FACTORS SHOULD THUS BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF ANALYTES IN HORSE SALIVA.

The etiology of AD remains unknown and a definitive diagnosis is not yet achievable for the disease during life. As a consequence, intense focus has been placed on establishing reliable AD biomarkers that both improve the certainty of an AD diagnosis during life and improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. In this chapter we explore biomarkers currently being evaluated in AD. Components of the central cholinergic system will be emphasized, especially highlighting the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase as an important diagnostic biomarker in AD.

BACTERIAL TRANSGLUTAMINASE AND HUMAN TRANSGLUTAMINASE 2 WERE USED TO MODIFY RESIDUES IN BETA-CASEIN WITH DANSYL CADAVERINE. BACTERIAL TRANSGLUTAMINASE WAS USED TO MODIFY RESIDUES IN HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE WITH BIOTIN CADAVERINE. TRYPTIC PEPTIDES WERE ANALYZED BY LC-MS/MS ON AN ORBITRAP FUSION LUMOS MASS SPECTROMETER. MODIFIED RESIDUES WERE IDENTIFIED IN PROTEIN PROSPECTOR SEARCHES OF MASS SPECTROMETRY DATA. THE MS/MS SPECTRA FROM MODIFIED CASEIN INCLUDED INTENSE PEAKS AT 336.2, 402.2, AND 447.2 FOR FRAGMENTS OF DANSYL CADAVERINE ADDUCTS ON GLUTAMINE. THE MS/MS SPECTRA FROM MODIFIED BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INCLUDED INTENSE PEAKS AT 329.2, 395.2, AND 440.2 FOR FRAGMENTS OF BIOTIN CADAVERINE ADDUCTS ON GLUTAMINE. NO EVIDENCE FOR TRANSGLUTAMINASE-CATALYZED ADDUCTS ON GLUTAMIC ACID, ASPARTIC ACID, OR ASPARAGINE WAS FOUND. CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT BACTERIAL TRANSGLUTAMINASE AND HUMAN TRANSGLUTAMINASE 2 SPECIFICALLY MODIFY GLUTAMINE. THE CHARACTERISTIC IONS ASSOCIATED WITH DANSYL CADAVERINE AND BIOTIN CADAVERINE ADDUCTS ON GLUTAMINE ARE USEFUL MARKERS FOR MODIFIED PEPTIDES.

Animals are used to evaluate the efficacy of HuBChE for protection against organophosphorus nerve agents. Pharmacokinetic studies of HuBChE in minipigs showed a mean residence time of 267‚ÄØh, similar to the half-life of HuBChE in humans, suggesting a high degree of similarity between BChE from 2 sources. Our aim was to compare the biochemical properties of PoBChE purified from porcine milk to HuBChE purified from human plasma. PoBChE hydrolyzed acetylthiocholine slightly faster than butyrylthiocholine, but was sensitive to BChE-specific inhibitors. PoBChE was 50-fold less sensitive to inhibition by DFP than HuBChE and 5-fold slower to reactivate in the presence of 2-PAM. The amino acid sequence of PoBChE determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was 91% identical to HuBChE. Monoclonal antibodies 11D8, mAb2, and 3E8 (HAH 002) recognized both PoBChE and HuBChE. Assembly of 4 identical subunits into tetramers occurred by noncovalent interaction with polyproline-rich peptides in PoBChE as well as in HuBChE, though the set of polyproline-rich peptides in milk-derived PoBChE was different from the set in plasma-derived HuBChE tetramers. It was concluded that the esterase isolated from porcine milk is PoBChE.

IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION IS THE PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR ACUTE OP TOXICITY. DISRUPTION OF CHOLINERGIC FUNCTION THROUGH THE INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) LEADS TO THE ACCUMULATION OF THE NEUROTRANSMITTER ACETYLCHOLINE. EXCESS ACETYLCHOLINE AT THE SYNAPSE RESULTS IN AN OVERSTIMULATION OF CHOLINERGIC NEURONS WHICH MANIFESTS IN THE COMMON SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF OP INTOXICATION (MIOSIS, INCREASED SECRETIONS, SEIZURES, CONVULSIONS, AND RESPIRATORY FAILURE). THE PRIMARY THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES TO TREAT OP INTOXICATION INCLUDES REACTIVATION OF INHIBITED ACHE WITH THE OXIME PRALIDOXIME (2-PAM) ALONG WITH THE MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST ATROPINE AND THE BENZODIAZEPINE, DIAZEPAM. CWNAS ARE ALSO KNOWN TO INHIBIT BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WITHOUT ANY APPARENT TOXIC EFFECTS. THEREFORE, BCHE MAY BE VIEWED AS A "BIOSCAVENGER" THAT STOICHIOMETRICALLY BINDS CWNAS AND REMOVES THEM FROM CIRCULATION. THE DEGREE OF INHIBITION OF ACHE AND BCHE AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 2-PAM ARE KNOWN TO VARY AMONG SPECIES. ANIMAL MODELS ARE IMPERATIVE FOR EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF CWNA MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES, AND A THOROUGH CHARACTERIZATION OF AVAILABLE ANIMAL MODELS IS IMPORTANT FOR TRANSLATING RESULTS TO HUMANS. THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE CIRCULATING LEVELS OF EACH OF THE CHOLINESTERASES AS WELL AS MULTIPLE KINETIC PROPERTIES (INHIBITION, REACTIVATION, AND AGING RATES) OF BOTH ACHE AND BCHE DERIVED FROM HUMANS TO ACHE AND BCHE DERIVED FROM COMMONLY USED LARGE ANIMAL MODELS.

HERE, WE REPORT THE CHARACTERIZATION OF FOUR BCHE MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGED EFFECT OF SUXAMETHONIUM (AMINO ACID NUMBERING BASED ON THE MATURED ENZYME): P.20DELVALPHEGLYGLYTHRVALTHR, P.LEU88HIS, P.ILE140DEL AND P.ARG386CYS. EXPRESSION OF RECOMBINANT BCHE MUTANTS, KINETIC ANALYSIS AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS WERE UNDERTAKEN TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE MUTATIONS INDUCE BCHE DEFICIENCY. THREE OF THE MUTATIONS STUDIED (P.20DELVALPHEGLYGLYTHRVALTHR, P.ILE140DEL AND P.ARG386CYS) LEAD TO A "SILENT" BCHE PHENOTYPE. RECOMBINANT BCHE EXPRESSION STUDIES FOR THESE MUTANTS REVEALED BCHE ACTIVITY LEVELS COMPARABLE TO UNTRANSFECTED CELLS. ONLY THE LAST ONE (HBCHE-L88H) PRESENTED BCHE ACTIVITY IN THE TRANSFECTED CELL CULTURE MEDIUM. THIS BCHE MUTANT (P.LEU88HIS) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER K  VALUE COMPARE TO THE WILD-TYPE ENZYME. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT A DESTABILIZATION OF A STRUCTURE IMPLICATED IN ENZYME ACTIVITY (Œ©-LOOP) CAN EXPLAIN THE MODIFICATION OF THE KINETIC PARAMETER OF THE MUTATED PROTEIN.

PROMPTED BY THE NEED FOR SUITABLE ANIMAL MODELS TO TEST NOVEL MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES, WE DEVELOPED A NEW CONVULSIVE MOUSE MODEL OF OP POISONING USING DIISOPROPYLFLUOROPHOSPHATE (DFP). USING ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY (ECOG), WE ANALYZED SEIZURE AND STATUS EPILEPTICUS (SE) OCCURRENCES, AS WELL AS RELATIVE POWER OF ECOG FREQUENCY BAND MODIFICATIONS AFTER DFP INJECTION IN MALE SWISS MICE. NEXT, WE INVESTIGATED DFP EFFECT ON CHE INHIBITION. HISTOLOGICAL CHANGES ON NEURONAL ACTIVITY AND NEURONAL DAMAGE WERE EXAMINED BY C-FOS IMMUNOLABELING AND FLUORO-JADE C STAINING. WE SHOWED THAT MICE EXPOSED TO DFP PRESENTED ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SEIZURES THAT RAPIDLY PROGRESSED TO SE WITHIN 20¬†MINUTES. LASTING >8¬†HOURS, DFP-INDUCED SE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR POWER SPECTRUM MODIFICATIONS IN SEIZING DFP ANIMALS COMPARED TO CONTROL ANIMALS. SEIZURES AND SE DEVELOPMENT WERE CONCOMITANT WITH PROFOUND CHE INHIBITION AND INDUCED MASSIVE NEURONAL DEGENERATION. PRESENTING ALL HALLMARKS OF CONVULSIVE OP POISONING, WE SHOWED THAT OUR MOUSE MODEL IS VALUABLE FOR STUDYING PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND PRECLINICAL TESTING OF NEWLY AVAILABLE THERAPEUTIC MOLECULES.

ABOUT 30 COMPOUNDS WERE DETERMINED BY LC-ESI-MS/MS WITH VALIDATED METHOD AND 3-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID (2,188.4¬†ŒºG/G EXTRACT) AND P-COUMARIC ACID (1,700.8¬†ŒºG/G EXTRACT) WERE MAJOR PHENOLIC ACIDS. (-)-EPIGALLOCATECHIN GALLATE (998.3¬†¬µG/G EXTRACT) AND GENISTEIN (159.3¬†ŒºG/G EXTRACT) WHICH ARE NEUROPROTECTIVE COMPOUNDS WERE THE PREDOMINANT FLAVONOIDS FOR A. NIGRUM AND A. SUBHIRSUTUM, RESPECTIVELY. ENZYME INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES OF SAMPLES WERE PERFORMED BY SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY WITH 96-WELL MICROPLATE READER. ALL SAMPLES SHOWED ANTI-ACHE, ANTI-BUCHE, AND ANTI-TYROSINASE ACTIVITIES AND THE AERIAL PART OF A. NIGRUM WAS THE MOST POTENT (IC  6.1, 3.27, 22.31¬†¬µG/ML, RESPECTIVELY). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: MANY ALLIUM SPECIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE CULTIVATED, ARE CONSUMED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AS FOOD IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IN THE LITERATURE, STUDIES ON THESE SPECIES HAVE GENERALLY FOCUSED ON ORGANOSULFUR COMPOUNDS OF THE SPECIES. IN OUR PRESENT STUDY, PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS HAVING A WIDE RANGE OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES WERE DETERMINED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TWO ALLIUM SPECIES CONSUMED AS FOOD. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED IN VITRO CHOLINESTERASES AND TYROSINASE INHIBITION ACTIVITIES OF THESE SPECIES. A CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS AND ENZYME INHIBITION ACTIVITIES. THESE RESULTS WERE FURTHER EXPLORED AND CONFIRMED BY PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA). PCA REVEALED THAT SAMPLES WERE DISCRIMINATED FROM EACH OTHER ACCORDING TO PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS AND ENZYME INHIBITORY POTENCIES. CONCLUSIVELY, THIS STUDY DETERMINES THAT THE CHEMICAL PROFILES AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF A. NIGRUM AND A. SUBHIRSUTUM.

AMAZONIAN SPONGES PRODUCE MASSIVE LARGE SPECIMENS AND ARE WIDELY SPREAD, TAXONOMICALLY DIVERSE AND THEIR METABOLITES COULD REPRESENT A NEW FRONTIER ON UNUSUAL NATURAL PRODUCTS TO TREAT DISEASES SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S AND MALARIA. SPECIES OF METANIA AND DRULIA (METANIIDAE) GENERA ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FAUNA OF AMAZONIAN FRESHWATER SPONGES. METHANOLIC EXTRACTS FROM SEVERAL SPECIES FROM THESE GENERA HAD THEIR INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES EVALUATED IN¬ÄÖVITRO, FOR PARASITE PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM AND ACETYL AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ENZYMES (ACHE AND BCHE). ALL EXTRACTS WERE ABLE TO INHIBIT ACHE, ALTHOUGH NO ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED TOWARDS BCHE. DRULIA URUGUAYENSIS EXTRACT WAS THE MOST POTENT, INHIBITING ACHE WITH IC  =1.04¬ÄÖMG/ML. FOR ANTIPLASMODIAL ACTIVITY, ALL SPECIES SHOWED INHIBITION TO P. FALCIPARUM, BUT METANIA RETICULATA BEING THE MOST EFFICIENT WITH IC  =2.7¬ÄÖŒºG/ML.

J ETHNOPHARMACOL 1872-7573 263 113162 2020 10.1016/j.jep.2020.113162 IN SOUTHERN ECUADOR, HORCHATA LOJANA IS A POPULAR AROMATIC AND REFRESHING BEVERAGE THAT IS PREPARED FROM AN AQUEOUS INFUSION OF DIFFERENT MIXTURES OF LOCAL MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTS. THE DRINK IS CONSIDERED A TRADITIONAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENT AND BRAIN TONIC; DUE THESE PROPERTIES, IT HAS BEEN DRUNK SINCE COLONIAL TIMES. SEVERAL PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF HORCHATA AQUEOUS INFUSION. HOWEVER, THE AROMATIC PROFILE AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE VOLATILE COMPONENTS TO THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF THE DRINK HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED SO FAR. FOR THESE REASONS, WE HAVE DETERMINED THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE ESSENTIAL OILS (EOS) DISTILLED FROM FIVE MIXTURES OF AROMATIC PLANTS COMMONLY USED FOR THE PREPARATION OF THIS TRADITIONAL DRINK. MOREOVER, TO SUPPORT THE CURATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE AROMATIC PLANTS, THE ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY OF THE EOS WAS EXAMINED. DIFFERENT BUNCHES OF FRESH MIXED MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTS, CALLED TONGOS, ARE SOLD AT LOCAL MARKETS IN THE PROVINCE OF LOJA FOR THE PREPARATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORCHATA. IN THIS RESEARCH WE HAVE PURCHASED PLANT BUNCHES SOLD AT FIVE POPULAR MARKETS OF LOJA PROVINCE. SUBSEQUENTLY, AROMATIC PLANTS IN EACH BUNCH WERE SEPARATED FROM MEDICINAL PLANTS AND WERE THEN HYDRODISTILLED TO GIVE THE CORRESPONDING EOS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EACH EO WAS DETERMINED BY GC-MS/GC-FID TECHNIQUES, WHEREAS THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY IN VITRO WAS DETERMINED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) ENZYMES. I) TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE AROMA COMPONENTS OF THE TRADITIONAL ECUADORIAN DRINK HORCHATA LOJANA; II) TO IDENTIFY BOTANICALLY THE MIXTURES OF AROMATIC PLANTS USED TO MAKE THE DRINK; III) TO ESTABLISH, ON THE BASIS OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE EOS, THE COMPOUNDS MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHARACTERISTIC BEVERAGE FLAVOR; IV) TO ESTABLISH THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF AN AROMATIC PATTERN CHARACTERISTIC OF EACH HORCHATA PREPARATION; V) TO TEST THE ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY OF THE EOS AGAINST ACHE AND BUCHE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE TRADITIONAL CONSUME OF THE DRINK AS AN EFFECTIVE BRAIN TONIC. A TOTAL OF 23 BOTANICAL FAMILIES AND 32 SPECIES OF PLANTS USED FOR THE PREPARATION OF FIVE DIFFERENT VARIANTS OF THE TRADITIONAL HORCHATA LOJANA BEVERAGE, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. FOURTEEN AROMATIC SPECIES WERE DETERMINED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHARACTERISTIC FLAVOR OF THE DRINK. ALL THE ANALYZED EOS BELONG TO THE MONOTERPENE TYPE. A TOTAL OF 88 COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE DIFFERENT EOS, TWENTY-FOUR OF WHICH ARE COMMON COMPONENTS OF THE OILS. ACCORDING TO THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE EOS DISTILLED FROM THE FIVE GROUPS OF HORCHATA LOJANA PLANTS, FOUR AROMATIC PROFILES HAVE BEEN DEFINED: (I) NERAL¬†+¬†GERANIAL¬†+¬†CARVONE, (II) NERAL¬†+¬†GERANIAL¬†+¬†MYRCENE; (III) GERANIAL¬†+¬†METHYL EUGENOL¬†+¬†ISOMENTHONE¬†+¬†NERAL¬†+¬†CITRONELLOL; (IV) (E)-ANETHOLE + GERANIAL¬†+¬†PULEGONE. MOREOVER, ACCORDING TO THE LITERATURE, SEVERAL AROMATIC PLANTS AND INDIVIDUAL EOS COMPONENTS EXHIBIT A WIDE RANGE OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. THIS FINDING AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT BUCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY EXHIBITED IN VITRO BY THE EOS GIVE SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT TO THE USE OF IDENTIFIED AROMATIC PLANTS IN THE TRADITIONAL PREPARATION OF HORCHATA, THAT IS CONSIDERED A NATURAL ANALGESIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY REMEDY, AND AN EFFECTIVE BRAIN TONIC.

COFFEE SILVERSKIN (CS) AND SPENT COFFEE GROUND (SCG), TWO BY-PRODUCTS OF COFFEE PRODUCTION, ARE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND, FOR THIS, SOME AUTHORS HAVE PROPOSED THEIR REUSE IN THE NUTRACEUTICAL, FOOD, AND COSMETIC SECTOR. HOWEVER, THEIR POTENTIAL ENZYME INHIBITORY PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN POORLY INVESTIGATED. HENCE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT WORK WAS TO STUDY THE ENZYMATIC INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, Œ±-AMYLASE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, AND TYROSINASE OF DIFFERENT EXTRACTS OF CS AND SCG. BEFORE THESE IN VITRO BIOASSAYS, THE PHYTOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EACH EXTRACT WAS INVESTIGATED VIA COLORIMETRIC ASSAYS AND HPLC-MS/MS ANALYSIS. IN ADDITION, THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES WERE EVALUATED BY DIFFERENT CHEMICAL APPROACHES. SCG EXTRACTS CONTAINED A HIGHER CONTENT OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS, NOTABLY THE SCG ETOH:H O EXTRACT WAS THE RICHEST IN CAFFEINE AND POSSESSED THE HIGHEST ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES. THE HYDROALCOHOLIC AND METHANOLIC EXTRACTS WERE SHOWN TO BE THE MOST ACTIVE AGAINST ALL TESTED ENZYMES, WHILE THE WATER EXTRACTS DISPLAYED LOWER ACTIVITY. OUR RESULTS SHOWED A WEAK CORRELATION BETWEEN BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND ENZYME INHIBITORY EFFECTS, PROVING INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES LIKELY DUE TO NON-PHENOLIC MOLECULES SUCH AS ALKALOIDS AND TERPENOIDS. OBTAINED FINDINGS COULD BE A STARTING POINT TO DEVELOP NOVEL NUTRACEUTICALS FROM CS AND SCG.

ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY MEANS OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY WITH DIODE ARRAY DETECTION COUPLED TO ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRIC (LC/DAD/ESI-MS). TOTAL PHENOLIC (TPC) AND FLAVONOID (TFC) CONTENTS AS WELL AS THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY THREE COMPLEMENTARY METHODS, DPPH, ABTS AND FRAP TESTS, WERE PERFORMED FOR EACH SAMPLE. ENZYME INHIBITORY EFFECTS AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND Œ±-AMYLASE WERE ALSO STUDIED. RESULTS SHOWED THAT TPC AND TFC VARIED ACCORDING TO VARIETY AS WELL AS THE PLANT PART. BRACTS PRESENTED THE HIGHEST TPC VALUES (10-15¬ÄÖMG GAE/G DW), WHILE LEAVES WERE DISTINGUISHED BY THE HIGHEST TFC VALUES (52-58¬ÄÖMG EQ/G DW). IN VITRO ASSAYS SHOWED THAT VIOLET D'HY√®RES BRACTS AND BLANC D'ORAN LEAVES PRESENT THE MOST ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES (30.040 AND 20.428¬ÄÖMGET/GDW, RESPECTIVELY, BY THE DPPH METHOD). LEAVES DEMONSTRATED THE HIGHEST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY EFFECTS. MOREOVER, ALL ORGANS DISPLAYED A NOTICEABLE INHIBITION TOWARDS Œ±-AMYLASE. LC/DAD/MS ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT ARTICHOKE BY-PRODUCTS ARE A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF BIOPHARMACEUTICALS SUCH AS LUTEOLIN DERIVATIVES FROM LEAVES AND MONO/DICAFFEOYLQUINIC ACIDS IN THE OTHER PARTS. THIS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT GLOBE ARTICHOKE BY-PRODUCTS, UNEXPLOITED IN OUR COUNTRY, ARE A PROMISING SOURCE OF NATURAL HEALTH PROMOTING COMPOUNDS WITH POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN THE FOOD AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES.

THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF THE EOS WAS EVALUATED VIA 2,2'-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL (DPPH), FERRIC-REDUCING/ANTIOXIDANT POWER (FRAP) AND 2,2'-AZINO-BIS(3-ETHYLBENZOTHIAZOLINE-6-SULPHONIC ACID (ABTS) ASSAYS. MOREOVER, THEIR CYTOTOXIC EFFECT WAS EVALUATED-AS WELL AS THEIR TYROSINASE, ACETYL- AND BUTYRYL-CHOLINESTERASE (ACHE AND BUCHE) INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES. THE CHEMICAL ANALYSES DETECTED 44, 45, 51, 53, 26 AND 40 COMPOUNDS IN EOS OF  ,  ,  ,  ,   AND  , RESPECTIVELY.   EO WAS MAINLY COMPOSED OF Œ≤-PINENE (20.7%), WHILE   EO CONTAINED DAVANONE D (49.5%) AS THE MAIN COMPONENT. Œ±-PINENE (41.8%) WAS DETECTED AS THE MAJOR CONSTITUENT IN BOTH   (41.8%) AND   (37.8%) EOS.   EO WAS CHARACTERIZED BY PULEGONE AS THE MOST ABUNDANT (76.9%) COMPOUND, WHILE LINALOOL (35.8%) WAS DETECTED AS A MAJOR CONSTITUENT IN   EO. THE ANTIOXIDANT POWER EVALUATION REVEALED IC50 VALUES RANGING FROM 2.61 TO 91.25 MG/ML FOR DPPH SCAVENGING ACTIVITY, WHILE THE FRAP VALUES RANGED FROM 0.97-8.17 ¬µMOL TROLOX EQUIVALENTS (TX)/G SAMPLE. IN THE ABTS ASSAY, THE VALUES RANGED FROM 7.01 TO 2.40 ¬µMOL TX/G SAMPLE. IN THE PRESENCE OF 1 MG/ML OF THE SAMPLES, TYROSINASE INHIBITION RATES RANGED FROM 11.35% TO 39.65%, ACHE INHIBITION RATES RANGED FROM 40.57% TO 73.60% AND BUCHE INHIBITION RATES RANGED FROM 6.47% TO 72.03%. A SIGNIFICANT CYTOTOXIC EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR   EO. THE OBTAINED RESULTS SUPPORT SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL USES OF THESE SPECIES IN FOOD PRESERVATION AND FOR PROTECTION AGAINST SEVERAL DISEASES.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE ANTIOXIDANT, ANTIPROLIFERATIVE AND ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES OF DIFFERENT EXTRACTS FROM LEAF AND STEM OF PISTACIA ATLANTICA DESF. THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WAS PERFORMED BY FOUR METHODS: DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC AND REDUCING POWER ASSAYS. ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY WAS PERFORMED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) ENZYMES. ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ASSAYS WERE INVESTIGATED AGAINST HELA CELL LINES USING XCELLIGENCE RTCA INSTRUMENT. THE SECONDARY METABOLITES COMPOSITION WAS ESTABLISHED BY HPLC-TOF/MS ANALYSIS. IN DPPH, REDUCING POWER AND IN ABTS .+ SCAVENGING ACTIVITY, ALL THE EXTRACTS SHOWED STRONG INHIBITORY ACTIVITY COMPARED TO SYNTHETIC ANTIOXIDANTS SUCH AS BUTYLATED HYDROXYTOLUENE (BHT) AND BUTYLATED HYDROXYANISOLE (BHA), IN WHICH THE ACTIVITIES WERE ALMOST EQUAL TO THE TWO STANDARDS. THE RESULTS WERE LESS SIGNIFICANT IN CUPRAC ASSAY. THE ETHYL ACETATE (ETOAC) EXTRACTS EXHIBITED THE BEST ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY IN ALL TESTS. MOREOVER, P. ATLANTICA EXTRACTS INHIBITED ACHE AND BCHE ACTIVITIES IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER. THE STRONGEST ACHE AND BUCHE INHIBITION ACTIVITIES WERE OBTAINED FOR ETOAC EXTRACT OF THE STEM (IC50 VALUES 15.14¬±0.74 AND 24.01¬±0.21 ŒºG/ML, RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED TO GALANTAMINE (IC50 VALUES 6.27¬±1.15 AND 34.75¬±1.99 ŒºG/ML, RESPECTIVELY). P. ATLANTICA EXTRACTS ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ANTIPROLEFERATIVE ACTIVITY AGAINST HELA CELL LINES, THE BEST ANTIPROLEFERATIVE ACTIVITY WAS OBTAINED FOR THE METHANOL AND ETOAC EXTRACTS. THE OBSERVED BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PRESENCE OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS AND FLAVONOIDS IN THE EXTRACTS. THE HPLC-TOF/MS ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THE PRESENCE OF 22 PHYTOCHEMICALS. GALLIC ACID AND RUTIN WERE THE MAIN COMPOUNDS DETECTED. CICHORIC, GENTISIC, VANILLIC, PROTOCATECHUIC AND ROSMARINIC ACIDS AS WELL AS CATECHIN AND QUERCETIN WERE ALSO PRESENT. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED GOOD ANTIOXIDANT, ANTICHOLINESTERASE AND ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITIES OF P. ATLANTICA EXTRACTS, WHICH OPENS UP NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES.

IN SILICO STUDY ON THE INHIBITION OF TYROSINASE AND Œ±-AMYLASE WAS ALSO PERFORMED. PIPERITONE (59.1%) AND ISOMERS OF PARA-MENTHADIENOLS (35.3%) WERE THE MAIN COMPOUNDS IN C. SCHOENANTHUS AND C. NERVATUS OILS, RESPECTIVELY. OIL FROM C. NERVATUS POSSESSED HIGHER ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY THAN THAT FROM C. SCHOENANTHUS EXCEPT FOR ITS METAL CHELATING ABILITY. BOTH OILS SHOWED HIGH ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY. IN SILICO STUDY SHOWED THAT TRANS-P-MENTHA-2,8-DIEN-1-OL AND PIPERITONE (BOTH ISOMERS) REVEALED THE BEST DOCKING SCORES FOR Œ±-AMYLASE AND TYROSINASE, RESPECTIVELY. IN CONCLUSION, OILS FROM THESE TWO CYMBOPOGON SPECIES COULD BE NEW NATURAL AGENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES FOR FOOD, COSMETICS, AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: RECENTLY, THERE IS A GROWING TENDENCY TO REPLACE SYNTHETIC OILS BY NATURAL ONES IN THE COSMETIC, FOOD, AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE INVESTIGATED THE CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF TWO CYMBOPOGON SPECIES ESSENTIAL OILS (C. SCHOENANTHUS (L.) SPRENG. AND C. NERVATUS). ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY, ENZYME INHIBITION, AND ANTIPROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS WERE TESTED FOR BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION WAS IDENTIFIED BY GC-MS. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, THE CYMBOPOGON SPECIES MAY BE UTILIZED AS SOURCES OF NATURAL BIOACTIVE AGENTS IN FOOD INDUSTRIES.

THE FIRST STEP IN THE MECHANISM IS COVALENT ADDITION OF THE OP TO THE SIDE CHAIN OF LYSINE. THIS ACTIVATES OP-LYSINE FOR REACTION WITH A NEARBY GLUTAMIC OR ASPARTIC ACID TO MAKE A GAMMA GLUTAMYL EPSILON LYSINE BOND. CROSSLINKED PROTEINS ARE HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT AGGREGATES. OUR GOAL WAS TO IDENTIFY THE RESIDUES IN THE HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (HUBCHE) TETRAMER THAT WERE CROSSLINKED FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH 1.5 MM CHLORPYRIFOS OXON. HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT BANDS WERE VISUALIZED ON AN SDS GEL. PROTEINS IN THE GEL BANDS WERE DIGESTED WITH TRYPSIN, SEPARATED BY LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY AND ANALYZED IN AN ORBITRAP MASS SPECTROMETER. MSMS FILES WERE SEARCHED FOR CROSSLINKED PEPTIDES USING THE BATCH-TAG PROGRAM IN PROTEIN PROSPECTOR. MSMS SPECTRA WERE MANUALLY EVALUATED FOR THE PRESENCE OF IONS THAT SUPPORTED THE CROSSLINKS. THE CROSSLINK BETWEEN LYS544 IN VLEMTGNIDEAEWEWK AGFHR AND GLU542 IN VLEMTGNIDEAEWE WK SATISFIED OUR CRITERIA INCLUDING THAT OF SPATIAL PROXIMITY. DISTANCES BETWEEN LYS544 AND GLU542 WERE 7.4 AND 9.5 √Ö, CALCULATED FROM THE CRYO-EM (ELECTRON MICROSCOPY) STRUCTURE OF THE HUBCHE TETRAMER. PARAOXON ETHYL, DIAZOXON, AND DICHLORVOS HAD LESS PRONOUNCED EFFECTS AS VISUALIZED ON SDS GELS. OUR PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT OP HAVE THE ABILITY TO CROSSLINK PROTEINS. IF OP-INDUCED PROTEIN CROSSLINKING OCCURS IN THE BRAIN, OP EXPOSURE COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME CASES OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE.

THE STUDY INCLUDES 33 SUBJECTS WITH OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND 10 HEALTHY CONTROLS (HC). THE EXPRESSION LEVELS OF CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM COMPONENT, RAR-RELATED ORPHAN RECEPTOR (RORC), TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR FORKHEAD BOX PROTEIN 3 (FOXP3) AND CYTOKINES WERE EVALUATED. TH17- AND TREG-RELATED CYTOKINES, CHOLINE LEVELS AND ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) ACTIVITY WERE QUANTIFIED IN OSA AND CONTROL SUBJECTS. ACHE AND NICOTINIC RECEPTOR Œ± 7 SUBUNIT (Œ±7NACHR) GENE EXPRESSION AND SERUM LEVELS OF CHOLINE, ACHE AND BUCHE WERE LOWER IN OSA PATIENTS THAN IN THE HC GROUP. COMPARED WITH THE HC GROUP, OSA PATIENTS EXHIBITED AN INCREASED EXPRESSION, SECRETION AND SERUM LEVELS OF PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, A REDUCED EXPRESSION, SECRETION AND SERUM LEVELS OF TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR (TGF)Œ≤ AND REDUCED FOXP3 MRNA LEVELS. THE TH17/TREG-RELATED CYTOKINE RATIO WAS HIGHER IN THE OSA GROUP. OUR RESULTS CONFIRM AND REINFORCE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT OSA MAY BE CONSIDERED A SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE, AND THAT AN IMBALANCE OF NON-NEURONAL CHOLINERGIC AND PRO/ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF COMORBIDITIES IN OSA SUBJECTS.

BMJ OPEN 2044-6055 10 E031212 2020 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031212 POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM (POD) IS A COMMON COMPLICATION AFTER ELECTIVE CARDIAC SURGERY. RECENT EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT A DISRUPTION IN THE NORMAL ACTIVITY OF THE CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH DELIRIUM. PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. SINGLE-CENTRE AT A EUROPEAN ACADEMIC HOSPITAL. IN OUR STUDY THE ENZYME ACTIVITIES OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WERE DETERMINED PREOPERATIVELY AS WELL AS ON THE FIRST AND SECOND POSTOPERATIVE DAY. THE CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD FOR THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WAS USED TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR THE PRESENCE OF POD. A TOTAL OF 114 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. POD WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN BCHE ACTIVITY ON POSTOPERATIVE DAY 1 (P=0.03). IN ADDITION, PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED POD, HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PREOPERATIVE ACHE ACTIVITY THAN PATIENTS WITHOUT POD (P<0.01). MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED A PREOPERATIVELY DECREASED ACHE ACTIVITY (OR 3.1; 95%¬ÄâCI 1.14 TO 8.46), ANTICHOLINERGIC TREATMENT (OR 5.09; 95%¬ÄâCI 1.51 TO 17.23), ELEVATED EUROPEAN SYSTEM FOR CARDIAC OPERATIVE RISK EVALUATION (OR 3.68; 95%¬ÄâCI 1.04 TO 12.99) AND AGE (OR 3.02; 95%¬ÄâCI 1.06 TO 8.62) TO BE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF POD. WE CONCLUDE THAT A REDUCTION IN THE ACETYLCHOLINE HYDROLYSING ENZYME ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIAC SURGERY MAY CORRELATE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF POD.
SHARMA P;TRIPATHI MK;SHRIVASTAVA SK CHOLINESTERASE AS A TARGET FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. METHODS MOL BIOL 1940-6029 2089 257-286 2019 10.1007/978-1-0716-0163-1_18 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) IS AN ENORMOUS HEALTHCARE CHALLENGE, AND 50 MILLION PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING FROM IT. THERE ARE SEVERAL PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS INVOLVED, BUT CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS REMAINED THE MAJOR TARGET FROM THE LAST 2-3 DECADES. AMONG FOUR AVAILABLE THERAPEUTICS (DONEPEZIL, RIVASTIGMINE, GALANTAMINE, AND MEMANTINE), THREE OF THEM ARE¬†CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. HEREIN, WE DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF ACETYLCHOLINE STERASE (ACHE) AND RELATED HYPOTHESIS IN AD ALONG WITH THE PHARMACOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE AVAILABLE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. THIS CHAPTER DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL CONGENERS AND HYBRIDS OF AVAILABLE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS ALONG WITH THEIR BINDING PATTERNS IN ENZYME ACTIVE SITES.
HARDOS JE;RUBENSTEIN M;PFAHLER S;SLEIGHT T CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION AND EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATE ESTERS IN AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE WORKERS. AEROSP MED HUM PERFORM 2375-6322 91 710-714 2020 10.3357/AMHP.5439.2020  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE WORKERS MAY BE EXPOSED TO ORGANOPHOSPHATES IN HYDRAULIC FLUID AND ENGINE OIL. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT INHALATION MAY NOT BE THE PRIMARY EXPOSURE ROUTE. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO MEASURE DERMAL CONTACT AND INHALATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION AND DETERMINE IF AIR FORCE SPECIALTY CODE SERVES AS AN EXPOSURE PREDICTOR.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE WORKERS WERE SAMPLED FOR CHANGES IN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE. DERMAL CONTACT WAS MEASURED USING WRIST-WORN SILICONE PASSIVE DOSIMETERS AND INHALATION EXPOSURE WAS MEASURED USING THERMAL DESORPTION TUBE AIR SAMPLING.  OVERALL PREVALENCE OF ANY CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION IN THE STUDY POPULATION WAS 25.33%. PREVALENCE OF INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE WAS 18.67% AND 6.67%, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN TRIBUTYL PHOSPHATE RESULT WAS 1.71 NG OF TRIBUTYL PHOSPHATE PER GRAM OF WRISTBAND (NG G ) [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI): 5.63, 9.05]. TRIPHENYL PHOSPHATE WAS MORE PREVALENT, WITH ONLY ONE SAMPLE BELOW THE LIMIT OF DETECTION (MEAN 1386.26 NG G ; 95% CI: 7297.78, 10,070.31), AND TRICRESYL PHOSPHATE WAS FOUND IN EVERY SAMPLE (MEAN 4311.65 NG G ; 95% CI: 8890.24, 17,512.31). NO ORGANOPHOSPHATES WERE DETECTED VIA AIR SAMPLING.  WORKERS EXPERIENCED ORGANOPHOSPHATE EXPOSURE AND CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION, BUT THE STUDY WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO ESTABLISH A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE AND DISEASE. EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATE ESTERS IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THROUGH CONTACT AND ABSORPTION OF CHEMICALS THROUGH THE SKIN THAN THROUGH INHALATION OF OIL MISTS. AIR FORCE SPECIALTY CODE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A GOOD PREDICTOR OF EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATES. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD CONSIDER USING A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE.
OLASEHINDE TA;OLANIRAN AO;OKOH AI CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY, ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES, AND PHYTOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF CHLOROCOCCUM SP. EXTRACTS. J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 45 E13395 2020 10.1111/jfbc.13395 IN THIS STUDY, CHLOROCOCCUM SP. WAS INVESTIGATED FOR ITS CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY POTENTIALS AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY. THE ALGAL SAMPLE WAS CULTIVATED, HARVESTED, AND EXTRACTED SEQUENTIALLY USING N-HEXANE, DICHLOROMETHANE, AND ETHANOL. THE EXTRACTS WERE CHARACTERIZED USING FOURIER TRANSMISSION INFRA-RED (FTIR) AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY. THE METAL CHELATING, RADICAL SCAVENGING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS ANTICHOLINESTERASE POTENTIALS OF THE ALGAL EXTRACT, WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED. FTIR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MICROALGAL BIOMASS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, ALKALOIDS, POLYSACCHARIDES, AND FATTY ACIDS. THE EXTRACTS SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF PHYTOL, NEOPHYTADIENE, BUTYLATED HYDROXYL TOLUENE, AND 3-TERT-BUTYL-4-HYDROXYANISOLE. THE ETHANOL EXTRACT SHOWED THE HIGHEST DPPH (IC  ¬†=¬†147.40¬†¬µG/ML) AND OH (IC  ¬†=¬†493.90¬†¬µG/ML) RADICAL SCAVENGING AND METAL CHELATING (IC  ¬†=¬†83.25¬†¬µG/ML) ACTIVITIES. SIMILARLY, THE ETHANOL EXTRACT (IC  ¬†=¬†13.83¬†¬µG/ML) EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY, WHILE THE DICHLOROMETHANE EXTRACT SHOWED THE HIGHEST BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. ALL THE EXTRACTS EXHIBITED ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES AND INHIBITORY EFFECTS AGAINST BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; HOWEVER, ETHANOL EXTRACTS SHOWED BETTER ACTIVITY. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: BIOMASS OBTAINED FROM SOME MICROALGAL SPECIES IS COMMONLY USED AS DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AND NUTRACEUTICALS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HIGH-VALUED PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES OF BIOMASS FROM CHLOROCOCCUM SP. HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED. CHLOROCOCCUM SP. EXTRACTS CONTAIN SOME ANTIOXIDANTS SUCH AS 3-TERT-BUTYL-4-HYDROXYANISOLE, BUTYLATED HYDROXYTOLUENE, PHYTOL, AND NEOPHYTADIENE. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EXTRACTS ALSO REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, POLYSACCHARIDES, AND FATTY ACIDS. THESE COMPOUNDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE OBSERVED ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES OF CHLOROCOCCUM SP. THE RESULT OF THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT CHLOROCOCCUM SP. MAY CONTAIN SOME NUTRACEUTICALS WHICH COULD BE USED AS ANTIOXIDANTS AND CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS.

SINGLE-CENTER PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. TWENTY-TWO BED PICU IN A TERTIARY-CARE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER IN GERMANY. A CONSECUTIVE COHORT OF CHILDREN ADMITTED AFTER MAJOR ELECTIVE SURGERY. CHILDREN WERE SCREENED FOR DELIRIUM BID OVER 5 CONSECUTIVE POSTOPERATIVE DAYS. ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE PLASMA ACTIVITY LEVELS WERE MEASURED PRIOR TO SURGERY AND ONCE DAILY DURING THE 5 DAY STUDY PERIOD. NUMBER OF ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUGS AND ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUG SCALE SCORE WERE CALCULATED FOR EACH PATIENT. NINETY-THREE CHILDREN (AGE RANGE, 0-17 YR) WERE INCLUDED. THE NUMBER OF ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUGS AS WELL AS THE ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUG SCALE SCORE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM, INDEPENDENTLY OF DISEASE SEVERITY. BASELINE CHOLINESTERASE ENZYME LEVELS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN PATIENTS WHO DID AND DID NOT DEVELOP POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM. BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS, BUT NOT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS, DROPPED BY 33% POSTOPERATIVELY, INDEPENDENT OF THE PRESENCE OF POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM. POSTOPERATIVE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS WERE INVERSELY RELATED TO NUMBER OF ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUGS, ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUG SCALE SCORE, AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN LEVELS. ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUG EXPOSURE WAS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM IN THIS COHORT, WITH DEMONSTRATION OF A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP. AS THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR MANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS, IT MAY BE REASONABLE TO AVOID ANTICHOLINERGIC EXPOSURE IN THE PICU WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

J EDUC HEALTH PROMOT 2277-9531 8 149 2019 10.4103/jehp.jehp_148_19 ORGANOPHOSPHATE COMPOUNDS (OPCS) ARE SUSPECTED TO MAKE CHANGES IN REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION BY OXIDANT/ANTIOXIDANT BALANCE DISRUPTION IN THE BRAIN, CONSEQUENTLY IMPAIRING HYPOTHALAMIC, PITUITARY ENDOCRINE FUNCTIONS, AND GONADAL PROCESSES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO OPCS ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM OF FARM WORKERS, IN HAMADAN, IRAN. A COMPARATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN RURAL FARMERS AND URBAN MEN AGED 20-40 YEARS. AFTER SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS OF SEMEN QUALITY PARAMETERS (SUCH AS SPERM COUNT, SPERM MOTILITY, PROGRESSIVE SPERM MOTILITY, AND SPERM MORPHOLOGY), SERUM BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITY (A SPECIFIC BIOMARKER IN OPCS EXPOSURE), AS WELL AS TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY, NITRIC OXIDE, AND LIPID PEROXIDATION LEVELS FOR BOTH SEMEN AND SERUM SAMPLES WERE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, SERUM SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED FOR REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES, INCLUDING FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE, LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH), AND TESTOSTERONE. OUR FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF SPERMS (  = 0.04), THEIR MOTILITY (  < 0.001), AND PROGRESSIVE STATUS (  < 0.001) IN RURAL FARMERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE URBAN POPULATION. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE WAS OBSERVED IN BCHE ACTIVITY (  < 0.001) AND LH LEVEL (  < 0.001), AND ALSO A REMARKABLE INCREASE WAS FOUND IN TESTOSTERONE LEVEL (  = 0.0014) IN THE SERUM OF RURAL FARMERS COMPARED TO THE URBAN POPULATION. ALONG WITH A DECREASE IN SEMEN TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY, A POSITIVE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN SPERM MOTILITY AND SEMEN ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (  = 0.45;   < 0.05). EXPOSURE TO OPCS MAY AFFECT REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES THROUGH IMPAIRING HYPOTHALAMIC AND/OR PITUITARY ENDOCRINE DYSFUNCTIONS AND GONADAL PROCESSES IN FARMERS.

MOLECULES 1420-3049 25 NA 2020 10.3390/molecules25071519 THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE CAPABILITY OF AN ESSENTIAL OIL MIX (MO: 1% AND 3%) IN AMELIORATING AMNESIA AND BRAIN OXIDATIVE STRESS IN A RAT MODEL OF SCOPOLAMINE (SCO) AND TRIED TO EXPLORE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM. THE MO WAS ADMINISTERED BY INHALATION TO RATS ONCE DAILY FOR 21 DAYS, WHILE SCO (0.7 MG/KG) TREATMENT WAS DELIVERED 30 MIN BEFORE BEHAVIORAL TESTS. DONEPEZIL (DP: 5 MG/KG) WAS USED AS A POSITIVE REFERENCE DRUG. THE COGNITIVE-ENHANCING EFFECTS OF THE MO IN THE SCO RAT MODEL WERE ASSESSED IN THE Y-MAZE, RADIAL ARM MAZE (RAM), AND NOVEL OBJECT RECOGNITION (NOR) TESTS. AS IDENTIFIED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (GC-MS), THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE MO IS COMPRISED BY LIMONENE (91.11%), FOLLOWED BY Œ≥-TERPINENE (2.02%), Œ≤-MYRCENE (1.92%), Œ≤-PINENE (1.76%), Œ±-PINENE (1.01%), SABINENE (0.67%), LINALOOL (0.55%), CYMENE (0.53%), AND VALENCENE (0.43%). MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS OF LIMONENE AS THE MAJOR COMPOUND IN MO WITH THE ACTIVE SITE OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WAS EXPLORED VIA MOLECULAR DOCKING EXPERIMENTS, AND VAN DER WAALS (VDW) CONTACTS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN LIMONENE AND THE ACTIVE SITE RESIDUES SER198, HIS438, LEU286, VAL288, AND PHE329. THE BRAIN OXIDATIVE STATUS AND ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO DETERMINED. MO REVERSED SCO-INDUCED MEMORY DEFICITS AND BRAIN OXIDATIVE STRESS, ALONG WITH CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY EFFECTS, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM IN THE ANTI-AMNESIA EFFECT. OUR PRESENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MO AMELIORATED MEMORY IMPAIRMENT INDUCED BY SCO VIA RESTORATION OF THE CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM ACTIVITY AND BRAIN ANTIOXIDANT STATUS.

MOLECULES 1420-3049 25 NA 2019 10.3390/molecules25010077 THE FACT THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS INCREASING, COMBINED WITH THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS FOR ITS TREATMENT, EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTICS FOR TREATING THIS BRAIN DISORDER. HEREIN, WE FOCUS ON GENERATING 12 CHALCONE-DONEPEZIL HYBRIDS, WITH THE GOAL OF SIMULTANEOUSLY TARGETING AMYLOID-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) PEPTIDES AS WELL AS CHOLINESTERASES (I.E., ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE)). WE PRESENT THE DESIGN, SYNTHESIS, AND BIOCHEMICAL EVALUATION OF THESE TWO SERIES OF NOVEL 1,3-CHALCONE-DONEPEZIL ( - ) OR 1,4-CHALCONE-DONEPEZIL ( - ) HYBRIDS. WE EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEIR STRUCTURES AND THEIR ABILITY TO INHIBIT ACHE/BCHE ACTIVITY AS WELL AS THEIR ABILITY TO BIND AŒ≤ PEPTIDES. WE SHOW THAT SEVERAL OF THESE NOVEL CHALCONE-DONEPEZIL HYBRIDS CAN SUCCESSFULLY INHIBIT ACHE/BCHE AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY OF  -BIOTINYLATED AŒ≤  OLIGOMERS. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE AŒ≤ BINDING SITE OF THESE HYBRIDS DIFFERS FROM THAT OF PITTSBURGH COMPOUND B (PIB).

TWIN RES HUM GENET 1832-4274 23 307-315 2021 10.1017/thg.2020.89 MORTALITY RISK IS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MANY PHYSIOLOGICAL OR BIOCHEMICAL RISK FACTORS, AND POLYGENIC RISK SCORES (PRSS) MAY OFFER AN ADDITIONAL OR ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO RISK STRATIFICATION. WE HAVE COMPARED THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF COMMON BIOCHEMICAL TESTS, PRSS AND INFORMATION ON PARENTAL SURVIVAL IN A COHORT OF TWINS AND THEIR FAMILIES. COMMON BIOCHEMICAL TEST RESULTS WERE AVAILABLE FOR UP TO 13,365 APPARENTLY HEALTHY MEN AND WOMEN, AGED 17-93 YEARS (MEAN 49.0, STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] 13.7) AT BLOOD COLLECTION. PRSS FOR LONGEVITY WERE AVAILABLE FOR 14,169 STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND REPORTED PARENTAL SURVIVAL FOR 25,784 PARTICIPANTS. A SEARCH FOR INFORMATION ON DATE AND CAUSE OF DEATH WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL DEATH INDEX, WITH MEDIAN FOLLOW-UP OF 11.3 YEARS. COX REGRESSION WAS USED TO EVALUATE ASSOCIATIONS WITH MORTALITY FROM ALL CAUSES, CANCERS, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND OTHER CAUSES. LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY WERE STRONGEST FOR C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, GAMMA-GLUTAMYL TRANSFERASE, GLUCOSE AND ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, WITH HAZARD RATIOS (HRS) OF 1.16 (95% CI [1.07, 1.24]), 1.15 (95% CI 1.04-1.21), 1.13 (95% CI [1.08, 1.19]) AND 1.11 (95% CI [1.05, 1.88]) PER SD DIFFERENCE, RESPECTIVELY. SIGNIFICANT NONLINEAR EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR UREA, URIC ACID AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE. LIPID RISK FACTORS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR MORTALITY IN OUR COHORT. FAMILY HISTORY AND PRS SHOWED WEAKER BUT SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WITH SURVIVAL, WITH HR IN THE RANGE 1.05 TO 1.09 PER SD DIFFERENCE. IN CONCLUSION, BIOCHEMICAL TESTS CURRENTLY PREDICT LONG-TERM MORTALITY MORE STRONGLY THAN GENETIC SCORES BASED ON GENOTYPING OR ON REPORTED PARENTAL SURVIVAL.

NONETHELESS, THERE HAS BEEN NO EFFORT TO DELINEATE THE BIOLOGICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILES OF LEAVES AND FLOWERS PREPARED BY DIFFERENT EXTRACTIVE SOLVENTS (ETHYL ACETATE, METHANOL (MEOH), AND WATER). THE PHARMACOLOGICAL POTENTIAL OF O. AMERICANUM EXTRACTS ON PRO-OXIDANT/PRO-INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS IN RAT COLON SPECIMENS TREATED WITH LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE WAS INVESTIGATED. IN PARALLEL, THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF THE EXTRACTS ON FUNGAL AND BACTERIAL STRAINS INVOLVED IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS WERE STUDIED. QUALITATIVE PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF PHENOLS, FLAVONOIDS, AND TANNINS. WATER EXTRACTS OF FLOWERS AND LEAVES SHOWED STRONG REDUCING AND RADICALS SCAVENGING POTENTIAL. BOTH MEOH AND ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACTS OF THE LEAVES AND FLOWERS WERE ABLE TO INHIBIT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, AND TYROSINASE. ALL THE EXTRACTS INHIBITED THE SELECTED BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL STRAINS, WHILE ONLY ETHYL ACETATE FLOWER EXTRACT DISPLAYED ANTIOXIDANT/ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS IN RAT COLON. THE WATER AND MEOH EXTRACTS STIMULATED COLON LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE (LDH) AND SEROTONIN (5-HT) AND INDUCED SPONTANEOUS MIGRATION OF HCT116 CELLS. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF ISOLATED PHYTOCHEMICALS FROM THE LEAVES AND FLOWERS OF O.

WITHIN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, NOT ONLY NEURONS BUT¬†ALSO OTHER BRAIN CELLS ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE EVS, WHICH HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND ALSO IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND COURSE OF SEVERAL NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. AMONG THESE, DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES (DLB) IS THE SECOND CAUSE OF DEMENTIA WORLDWIDE, THOUGH MOST CASES ARE MISSED OR MISDIAGNOSED AS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) DUE TO THE IMPORTANT CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL OVERLAP BETWEEN BOTH DISEASES. IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIND RELIABLE BIOMARKERS FOR DLB DIAGNOSIS, OUR GROUP CHARACTERIZED THE PROTEOME OF PLASMA-DERIVED EVS FROM DLB PATIENTS COMPARED TO AGED-MATCHED HEALTHY CONTROLS (HCS) USING TWO DIFFERENT PROTEOMIC LC-MS/MS APPROACHES. REMARKABLY, WE FOUND THAT GELSOLIN AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE WERE DIFFERENTIALLY IDENTIFIED BETWEEN DLB AND HCS. FURTHER VALIDATION OF THESE RESULTS USING CONVENTIONAL ELISA TECHNIQUES, AND INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL GROUP OF AD PATIENTS, POINTED TO DECREASED LEVELS OF GELSOLIN IN PLASMA-EVS FROM DLB COMPARED TO HCS AND TO AD SAMPLES. THUS, GELSOLIN MAY BE CONSIDERED A POSSIBLE BIOMARKER FOR THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN DLB AND AD.

DOCKING-POST PROCESSING (DPP) AND POSE FILTRATION PROTOCOLS AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE RESULTED IN THREE HITS (AW00308, HTS04089, AND JFD03947). MOLECULAR MECHANICS-GENERALIZED BORN SURFACE AREA (MM-GBSA) AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION ANALYSIS AFFIRMED THE STABILITY AND BINDING PATTERN OF THE DOCKED COMPLEX JFD03947, WHICH WAS FURTHER SYNTHESIZED AND EVALUATED FOR IN VITRO CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION (ACHE, IC ¬Äâ=¬Äâ0.062 ¬µM; BCHE, IC ¬Äâ=¬Äâ1.482 ¬µM) ACTIVITY. THE ENZYME KINETICS STUDY OF THE JFD03947 AGAINST HACHE AND HBCHE SUGGESTED A MIXED TYPE OF INHIBITION. THE RESULTS OF THIOFLAVIN T-ASSAY ALSO ELICITED ANTI-AŒ≤ AGGREGATION ACTIVITY BY JFD03947. FURTHER, BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF IDENTIFIED COMPOUND JFD03947 ALSO SHOWED NEUROPROTECTIVE ABILITY AGAINST THE SH-SY5Y NEUROBLASTOMA CELL LINES.
SUSSMAN JL;SILMAN I COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES ON CHOLINESTERASES: STRENGTHENING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTEGRATION OF STRUCTURE, DYNAMICS AND FUNCTION.

The catalytic triad of the wild-type enzyme (S198¬∑H438¬∑E325) was replaced by S198¬∑H438¬∑N322E in silico. Molecular dynamics for 1.5 Œºs and Markov state model analysis showed that the new catalytic triad should be operative in the mutant enzyme, suggesting functionality. QM/MM modeling performed for the reaction of wild-type BChE and double mutant with echothiophate showed high reactivity of the mutant towards the organophosphate. A truncated monomeric (L530 stop) double mutant was expressed in Expi293‚ÄØcells. Non-purified transfected cell culture medium was analyzed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under native conditions followed by activity staining with BTC as the substrate provided evidence that the monomeric BChE mutant was active. Inhibition of the double mutant by echothiophate followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and activity staining showed that this enzyme slowly self-reactivated. However, because Expi293‚ÄØcells secrete an endogenous BChE tetramer and several organophosphate-reacting enzymes, catalytic parameters and self-reactivation constants after phosphorylation of the new mutant were not determined in the crude cell culture medium. The study shows that the computer-designed double mutant (N322E/E325G) with a new catalytic triad (S198¬∑H438¬∑N322E) is a suitable template for design of novel active human BChE mutants that display an organophosphate hydrolase activity.

BIOORG CHEM 1090-2120 94 103387 2019 10.1016/j.bioorg.2019.103387 WE SYNTHESIZED CONJUGATES OF TACRINE WITH 1,2,4-THIADIAZOLE DERIVATIVES LINKED BY TWO DIFFERENT SPACERS, PENTYLAMINOPROPENE (COMPOUNDS 4) AND PENTYLAMINOPROPANE (COMPOUNDS 5), AS POTENTIAL DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD). THE CONJUGATES EFFECTIVELY INHIBITED CHOLINESTERASES WITH A PREDOMINANT EFFECT ON BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). THEY WERE ALSO EFFECTIVE AT DISPLACING PROPIDIUM FROM THE PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE (PAS) OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), SUGGESTING THAT THEY COULD BLOCK ACHE-INDUCED Œ≤-AMYLOID AGGREGATION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPOUNDS EXHIBITED HIGH RADICAL-SCAVENGING CAPACITY. CONJUGATES 5 HAD HIGHER ANTI-BCHE ACTIVITY AND GREATER ANTI-AGGREGANT POTENTIAL AS WELL RELATIVELY LOWER POTENCY AGAINST CARBOXYLESTERASE THAN COMPOUNDS 4. QUANTUM-MECHANICAL (QM) CHARACTERIZATION AGREED WITH NMR DATA TO IDENTIFY THE MOST STABLE FORMS OF CONJUGATES FOR DOCKING STUDIES, WHICH SHOWED THAT THE COMPOUNDS BIND TO BOTH CAS AND PAS OF ACHE CONSISTENT WITH MIXED REVERSIBLE INHIBITION. CONJUGATES 4 WERE MORE POTENT RADICAL SCAVENGERS, IN AGREEMENT WITH HOMO LOCALIZATION IN THE ENAMINE-THIADIAZOLE SYSTEM. COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES SHOWED THAT ALL OF THE CONJUGATES WERE EXPECTED TO HAVE GOOD INTESTINAL ABSORPTION, WHEREAS CONJUGATES 4 AND 5 WERE PREDICTED TO HAVE MEDIUM AND HIGH BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITY, RESPECTIVELY. ALL CONJUGATES WERE PREDICTED TO HAVE MEDIUM CARDIAC TOXICITY RISKS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE CONJUGATES ARE PROMISING CANDIDATES FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION AS MULTIFUNCTIONAL THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF AD.

The ACh concentration modulation is associated to the two major esterases, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). AChE H353N protein polymorphism is related to low Chagas chronic disease prognostic. In order to evaluate the correlation of plasmatic BuChE concentration and the presence of AChE H353N polymorphism in Chagas disease patients and healthy individuals, we studied two groups of individuals, one of 61 Chagas disease patients and another of 74 healthy individuals. Plasma concentration of BuChE was measured by the chemiluminescent method and AChE H353N polymorphism was investigated by PCR-RFLP and sequencing of the respective encoding AChE gene fragment. The BuChE concentration was statistically higher in Chagas disease patients, with no AChE genotype significant influence. AChE genotypes YT*A/YT*A, YT*A/YT*B and YT*B/YT*B, respectively, were expressed in 53 (86.88%), 7 (11.46%) and one (1.64%) chagasic patients, and in 68 (91.89%), 6 (8.10%) and none healthy individuals. BuChE activity may represent an important marker for chronic Chagas disease inflammatory process and prognostic. Lower BuChE concentration correlated with AChE YT*B allele, although without statistical power.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CYPERMETHRIN AND FIPRONIL ON NEUROTOXICITY AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN PHYSALAEMUS GRACILIS. PHYSALAEMUS GRACILIS TADPOLES WERE EXPOSED TO FIVE INSECTICIDE CONCENTRATIONS AND A CONTROL TREATMENT, WITH SIX REPLICATES. DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD, THE TADPOLE MORTALITY RATE WAS EVALUATED AND AFTER 168 H, THE NEUROTOXIC ENZYME ACTIVITY AND METABOLITE QUANTIFICATION RELATED TO THE ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEM WERE MEASURED. TADPOLES REDUCED ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITIES WHEN EXPOSED TO 20 ŒºG L  CBI AND AT ALL FBI CONCENTRATIONS, RESPECTIVELY. GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (GST) AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD) ACTIVITIES SHOWED AN INCREASE FROM CONCENTRATIONS OF 6 ŒºG L  AND 20 ŒºG L  OF CBI, RESPECTIVELY. AFTER EXPOSURE OF P. GRACILIS TADPOLES TO FBI, INHIBITIONS OF ACHE AND BCHE WERE OBSERVED AT THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS EVALUATED (500 AND 1500 ŒºG L ). SOD ACTIVITY DECREASED FROM 50 ŒºG L  OF FBI; HOWEVER, CATALASE (CAT) AND GST ACTIVITIES AND CARBONYL PROTEIN LEVELS INCREASED, REGARDLESS OF THE EVALUATED DOSE. WE OBSERVED THAT BOTH INSECTICIDES PROMOTED OXIDATIVE STRESS AND NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS IN P. GRACILIS TADPOLES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BIOCHEMICAL BIOMARKERS CAN BE USED FOR MONITORING TOXICITY INSECTICIDES FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRESERVATION OF P. GRACILIS.

AS THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY LINKED WITH PANCREATIC CANCER (PC), THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE PROGNOSTIC IMPACT OF PLASMA BCHE IN PC.   DATA FROM 574 CONSECUTIVE PC PATIENTS, TREATED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2018 AT A SINGLE ACADEMIC CENTER, WAS EVALUATED. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS CANCER-SPECIFIC SURVIVAL (CSS), ANALYZED BY KAPLAN-MEIER CURVE, AND BOTH UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE COX PROPORTIONAL MODELS.   BCHE ACTIVITY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH OTHER LIVER PARAMETERS (BILIRUBIN, GAMMA-GLUTAMYL TRANSFERASE (GGT), ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (AST), ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE (ALP), AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP)), AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH ALBUMIN LEVELS, RESPECTIVELY (  < 0.01). IN UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS, A LOW PLASMA BCHE ACTIVITY WAS A FACTOR OF POOR CSS (HAZARD RATIO: 1.4, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 1.129-1.754,   = 0.002). IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, TUMOR STAGE, TUMOR GRADE, ADMINISTRATION OF CHEMOTHERAPY, BILIRUBIN LEVELS AND A LOW BCHE ACTIVITY (HAZARD RATIO: 1.42, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 1.10-1.82;   = 0.006) WERE IDENTIFIED AS INDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC FACTORS.  : DECREASED ACTIVITY OF BCHE IN BLOOD PLASMA PREDICTS SHORTER SURVIVAL TIME IN PC PATIENTS.

ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE HAS INDICATED THAT HCES2A INHIBITOR THERAPY CAN MODULATE THE PHARMACOKINETIC AND TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILES OF SOME IMPORTANT HCES2A-SUBSTRATE DRUGS, SUCH AS THE ANTICANCER AGENT CPT-11. HEREIN, A SERIES OF INDANONE-CHALCONE HYBRIDS ARE DESIGNED AND SYNTHESIZED TO FIND POTENT AND HIGHLY SELECTIVE HCES2A INHIBITORS. INHIBITION ASSAYS DEMONSTRATED THAT MOST INDANONE-CHALCONE HYBRIDS DISPLAYED STRONG TO MODERATE HCES2A INHIBITION ACTIVITIES. STRUCTURE-HCES2A INHIBITION ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP STUDIES SHOWED THAT INTRODUCTION OF A HYDROXYL AT THE C4' SITE AND INTRODUCTION OF AN N-ALKYL GROUP AT THE C6 SITE WERE BENEFICIAL FOR HCES2A INHIBITION. PARTICULARLY, B7 (AN N-ALKYLATED 1-INDANONE-CHALCONE HYBRID) EXHIBITED THE MOST POTENT INHIBITION ON HCES2A AND EXCELLENT SPECIFICITY (THIS AGENT COULD NOT INHIBIT OTHER HUMAN ESTERASES INCLUDING HCES1A AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE). INHIBITION KINETIC ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT B7 POTENTLY INHIBITED HCES2A-MEDIATED FD HYDROLYSIS IN A MIXED INHIBITION MANNER, WITH A CALCULATED K  VALUE OF 0.068¬†ŒºM. FURTHERMORE, B7 WAS CAPABLE OF INHIBITING INTRACELLULAR HCES2A IN LIVING CELLS AND DISPLAYED GOOD METABOLIC STABILITY. COLLECTIVELY, OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT INDANONE-CHALCONE HYBRIDS ARE GOOD CHOICES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HCES2A INHIBITORS, WHILE B7 IS A PROMISING CANDIDATE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ANTI-DIARRHEA AGENTS TO AMELIORATE IRINOTECAN-INDUCED INTESTINAL TOXICITY.

In the current work, a bambuterol derivative lacking one of the carbamoyloxy groups on the benzene ring (BMC-1) and its analogues were synthesized using 1-(3-hydroxyphenyl) ethan-1-one and 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethan-1-one as starting materials. In-vitro cholinesterase assay established that nine compounds were more potent to inhibit both electric eel AChE and equine serum BChE than rivastigmine under the same experimental conditions. Further study confirmed that among the nine carbamates, BMC-3 (IC50(AChE)¬ =¬ 792¬ nM, IC50(BChE)¬ =¬ 2.2¬ nM) and BMC-16 (IC50(AChE)¬ =¬ 266¬ nM, IC50(BChE)¬ =¬ 10.6¬ nM) were excellent cholinesterase inhibitors with potential of permeating through the blood-brain barrier. These carbamates could be used as potential dual inhibitors of AChE and BChE and to discover novel drugs for the treatment of AD and PD dementia.

MOST OF THE COMPOUNDS SHOWED GOOD INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES TOWARD BOTH ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). AMONG THEM, 10F WAS FOUND TO BE THE MOST POTENT INHIBITOR AGAINST ACHE (IC ¬ÄØ=¬ÄØ0.62¬ÄØ¬±¬ÄØ0.17¬ÄØŒºM), AND 14 WAS THE MOST POTENT INHIBITOR AGAINST BCHE (IC ¬ÄØ=¬ÄØ0.10¬ÄØ¬±¬ÄØ0.01¬ÄØŒºM). REPRESENTATIVE COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS 10F AND 12G, ACT IN A COMPETITIVE MANNER WHEN THEY INHIBIT ACHE OR BCHE. MOLECULAR DOCKING AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION REVEALED THAT THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS BIND TO THE TARGET BY SIMULTANEOUSLY INTERACTING WITH THE CATALYTIC ACTIVE SITE (CAS) AND THE PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE (PAS) OF BOTH ACHE AND BCHE. THE U-SHAPED CONFIRMATION WAS PREFERRED WHEN 12G BOUND TO BCHE, WHICH WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE LINEAR CONFORMATION OF 10F BOUND TO ACHE. CELL-BASED ASSAYS HAVE CONFIRMED THE MODERATE NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS 10F AND 12G AGAINST H O -INDUCED OXIDATIVE DAMAGE TOWARDS PC12 CELLS. MOREOVER, THE HEPATOTOXICITY OF 12G WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF TACRINE, INDICATING ITS POTENTIAL SAFETY AS AN ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S AGENT.

The oxidase-like activity of MnO2 nanosheets enables them to catalyze the oxidation of non-fluorescent substrate TH to generate strong fluorescent thiochrome (TC). When the target BChE is introduced to form thiocholine in the presence of S-butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCh), MnO2 nanosheets are reduced by thiocholine to Mn2+, resulting in the loss of their oxidase-like activity and the reduction of TC fluorescence. Based on this, a BChE activity fluorescence biosensor is constructed utilizing the luminescence behavior variation of TH and the oxidase-like activity of MnO2 nanosheets. The fluorescence biosensor shows a sensitive response to BChE, and the detection limit reaches 0.036 U¬ L‚àí1. In addition, the feasibility of the biosensor in real samples analysis is studied with satisfactory results.

These chemicals can inhibit plasmatic butyrylcholinesterases (BChE) activity in B.¬ asper. Caribbean and Pacific populations of B.¬ asper belong to two divergent lineages that exhibit robust genetic partitioning; however, differences across versants in biochemistry and hematology have not yet been examined, especially in BChE variations. This study aims to evaluate the differences of BChE plasmatic values, hematology parameters, and some biochemical analytes as biomarkers in the presence of organophosphates between the Pacific and Caribbean population of B. asper in Costa Rica. A total of 89 snakes (41 Pacific and 48 Caribbean) were used, and hematology parameter, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein and BChEs were evaluated. Differences in hemoglobin content, thrombocytes, white cell count, AST, and BChE values were found between both versants. Intrinsic genetic factors might influence the variation found in BChE and AST values in the snakes sampled from both versants; moreover, understanding this variation in BChE and AST values across the B. asper's distribution can be useful in future ecotoxicology, biomonitoring, genetic and other clinical/health studies.

Most were specific inhibitors of BuChE. However, the potent inhibitory effects on both cholinesterases of one sub-class, the cationic aminoureas, provide an additional binding mechanism to cholinesterases for these compounds. The comparative effects of aminoureas on wild-type BuChE and several BuChE mutants indicate a binding process involving salt linkage with the aspartate of the cholinesterase peripheral anionic site. The effect of such compounds on cholinesterase activity at high substrate concentration supports ionic interaction of aminoureas at the peripheral anionic site.

For decades, numerous research efforts have been directed at engineering BChE as a bioscavenger of organophosphorus insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents. However, it has been a grand challenge to cost-efficiently produce BChE in large-scale. Recently reported studies have successfully designed a truncated BChE mutant (with amino-acid substitutions on 47 residues that are far away from the catalytic site), denoted as BChE-M47 for convenience, which can be expressed in E. coli without loss of its catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to dimerize the truncated BChE mutant protein expressed in a prokaryotic system (E. coli) in order to further improve its thermal stability by introducing a pair of cross-subunit disulfide bonds to the BChE-M47 structure. Specifically, the E377C/A516C mutations were designed and introduced to BChE-M47, and the obtained new protein entity, denoted as BChE-M48, with a pair of cross-subunit disulfide bonds indeed exists as a dimer with significantly improved thermostability and unaltered catalytic activity and reactivity compared to BChE-M47. These results provide a new strategy for optimizing protein stability for production in a cost-efficient prokaryotic system. Our enzyme, BChE-M48, has a half-life of almost one week at a 37¬∞C, suggesting that it could be utilized as a highly stable bioscavenger of OP insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents.

Two compound libraries were selected and 64 124 amine containing moieties were screened using a hierarchical virtual screening protocol to discover new selective BuChE inhibitors. From these and subsequent docking experiments, 9-phenylacridinedione (9-PAD) was identified as a promising scaffold for selective inhibition of BuChE. Selected top dock scored 9-PADs were assayed and compounds 3 and 6 exhibited potent and highly selective human BuChE inhibition (IC50: 98¬ nM and 142¬ nM, respectively). Both molecules were also predicted to show sufficient brain permeability, not have any substantial toxicities, especially hepatotoxicity, and no significant in vitro cytotoxicity against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at concentrations up to 100¬ ¬µM. These findings indicate that 9-PAD is a promising lead structure for the development of agents able to treat late stage AD.

c("Mohd Abdullaha", "Vijay K. Nuthakki", "Sandip B.

However, the overexpression of these enzymes results in hampered neurotransmission. Both the major forms of cholinesterase enzymes viz. acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) play a crucial role in blocking neurotransmission; therefore, in recent years, a strategy of dual cholinesterase inhibition is being explored. Herein, we developed an energy-optimized e-pharmacophore hypothesis AHHPRR from AChE-donepezil complex and screened a set of 15 scaffolds that were designed imaginarily. The ligand with N-(1-benzylpyridinium) benzamide framework has shown the highest fitness and volume score, which was chosen for synthesis and validation. A series of pyridinium benzamides were synthesized and screened for cholinesterase inhibition that led to the identification of 7b, a naphthalene containing N-(1-benzylpiperidine) benzamide as a potent dual AChE and BChE inhibitor with IC50 values of 0.176, and 0.47¬ ŒºM, respectively. The kinetic study indicated that 7b inhibits AChE in a non-competitive manner with Ki value of 0.21¬ ŒºM, and BChE in a mixed-fashion with Ki of 0.15¬ ŒºM. The observed mode of inhibition was corroborated with molecular docking studies. The MD simulation studies pointed out that both AChE and BChE undergo low conformational changes in complex with 7b. The benzamide 7b displayed high BBB permeability in PAMPA assay, which indicates its potential for further exploration in preclinical studies for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

We herein present the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel hydroxyethylamine derivatives displaying unique, multiple properties that have not been previously reported. The original mechanism of action combines inhibitory activity against disease-modifying targets: Œ≤-secretase enzyme (BACE1) and amyloid Œ≤ (AŒ≤) aggregation, along with an effect on targets associated with symptom relief - inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and Œ≥-aminobutyric acid transporters (GATs). Among the obtained molecules, compound 36 exhibited the most balanced and broad activity profile (eeAChE IC50¬ =¬ 2.86¬ ŒºM; eqBuChE IC50¬ =¬ 60¬ nM; hBuChE IC50¬ =¬ 20¬ nM; hBACE1 IC50¬ =¬ 5.9¬ ŒºM; inhibition of AŒ≤ aggregation¬ =¬ 57.9% at 10¬ ŒºM; mGAT1 IC50¬ =¬ 10.96¬ ŒºM; and mGAT2 IC50¬ =¬ 19.05¬ ŒºM). Moreover, we also identified 31 as the most potent mGAT4 and hGAT3 inhibitor (IC50¬ =¬ 5.01¬ ŒºM and IC50¬ =¬ 2.95¬ ŒºM, respectively), with high selectivity over other subtypes. Compounds 36 and 31 represent new anti-Alzheimer agents that can ameliorate cognitive decline and modify the progress of disease.

INCREASING EVIDENCE HAS INDICATED THAT POTENT INHIBITION ON INTESTINAL HCES2A MAY REDUCE THE EXCESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF SN-38 (THE HYDROLYTIC METABOLITE OF IRINOTECAN WITH POTENT CYTOTOXICITY) IN THE INTESTINAL TRACT AND THEREBY ALLEVIATE THE INTESTINAL TOXICITY TRIGGERED BY IRINOTECAN. IN THIS STUDY, MORE THAN SIXTY NATURAL ALKALOIDS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND THEIR INHIBITORY EFFECTS AGAINST HCES2A ARE ASSAYED USING A FLUORESCENCE-BASED BIOCHEMICAL ASSAY. FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY SCREENING, SEVENTEEN ALKALOIDS ARE FOUND WITH STRONG TO MODERATE HCES2A INHIBITION ACTIVITY. PRIMARY STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS (SAR) ANALYSIS OF NATURAL ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS REVEAL THAT THE BENZO-1,3-DIOXOLE GROUP AND THE AROMATIC PYRIDINE STRUCTURE ARE BENEFICIAL FOR HCES2A INHIBITION. FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT A STEROIDAL ALKALOID RESERPINE EXHIBITS STRONG HCES2A INHIBITION ACTIVITY (IC ¬†=¬†0.94¬†ŒºM) AND HIGH SELECTIVITY OVER OTHER HUMAN SERINE HYDROLASES INCLUDING HCES1A, DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE IV (DPP-IV), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND THROMBIN. INHIBITION KINETIC ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT RESERPINE ACTS AS A NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITOR AGAINST HCES2A-MEDIATED FD HYDROLYSIS. MOLECULAR DOCKING SIMULATIONS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE POTENT INHIBITION OF HCES2A BY RESERPINE COULD PARTIALLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO ITS STRONG œÉ-œÄ AND S-œÄ INTERACTIONS BETWEEN RESERPINE AND HCES2A. COLLECTIVELY, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RESERPINE IS A POTENT AND HIGHLY SELECTIVE INHIBITOR OF HCES2A, WHICH CAN BE SERVED AS A PROMISING LEAD COMPOUND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFICACIOUS AND SELECTIVE ALKALOIDS-TYPE HCES2A INHIBITORS FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS.

However, recent research has shown that the specific inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) could better ameliorate symptoms within patients. In addition, it has recently been shown that selective inhibition of BChE can also significantly attenuate the toxicity and physiological effects of heroin. Currently, there are no specific and potent inhibitors of BChE approved for use in AD or heroin abuse. Through a combined use of in silico and in vitro screening, we have found three compounds with sub-50‚ÄØnM IC50 values that specifically target BChE. These newly discovered BChE inhibitors can act as the lead scaffolds for future development of the desirably potent and selective BChE inhibitors.

CURR ALZHEIMER RES 1875-5828 16 1230-1244 2019 10.2174/1567205016666191203161509 INSULIN RESISTANCE CAUSES DECREASED UPTAKE OF GLUCOSE WHICH PROMOTES THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF TYPE 2 ASSOCIATED NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENTS. THE STUDY WAS AIMED TO EVALUATE THE INHIBITION POTENTIAL OF THE ETHANOLIC EXTRACT OF PROSOPIS CINERARIA (EPC) PODS AGAINST DPP-4 AND CHOLINESTERASE ENZYMES BY IN-VITRO, IN-VIVO AND IN-SILICO ASSESSMENTS. THE PRESENT STUDY CONSISTS OF IN VIVO STUDIES ON A DIABETES-INDUCED RAT MODEL BY HOMA (HOMEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT) AND RELATED PARAMETERS, IN VITRO STUDIES THROUGH THE DPP-4 ENZYME ASSAY AND CHOLINESTERASE ASSAYS USING ELLMAN'S REACTION. THE IN-SILICO STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED BY THE MOLECULAR DOCKING OF CINERIN C WITH TARGETED ENZYMES. THE PHYTOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EXTRACT WAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH LCMS STUDIES. THE ANTIOXIDANT STUDIES ON THE EXTRACT WERE PERFORMED BY FRAP AND TEAC ASSAYS. THE EXTRACT SHOWED 64.8% MAXIMUM INHIBITION OF DPP-4, 34.91% INHIBITION OF ACHE AND 74.35% INHIBITION OF BUCHE. THE ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY OF THE EXTRACT WAS OBSERVED TO BE 847.81¬±16.25ŒºM FE2+ EQUIVALENT IN THE FRAP ASSAY AND 0.40 ¬± 0.08 MMOL/L OF TROLOX EQUIVALENT IN THE TEAC ASSAY. THE IN VIVO STUDY SHOWED COMPETENT GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AGAINST SIGNIFICANT HOMA IR (1.5), HOMA % Œ≤ (26.5) AND HOMA % S (68.8) AS WELL AS PANCREATIC CELL MASS PROLIFERATION. THE INSILICO ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED POSITIVE INTERACTIONS OF CINERIN C WITH TARGETED ENZYMES (DPP4 AND CHOLINESTERASE). IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE PHYTOCONSTITUENTS OF PROSOPIS CINERARIA POD EXTRACT CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY CONSIDERED IN NEUROPHARMACOLOGY TO RESOLVE INSULIN RESISTANCE-INDUCED NEUROLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AS IT SHOWED INHIBITION AGAINST DPP-4, ACHE AND BUCHE TARGET ENZYMES.
CHAKRAVARTY H;JU Y;CHEN WH;TAM KY DUAL TARGETING OF CHOLINESTERASE AND AMYLOID BETA WITH PYRIDINIUM/ISOQUINOLIUM DERIVATIVES. DRUG DEV RES 1098-2299 81 242-255 2019 10.1002/ddr.21631 WITH THE SURGE IN THE CASES OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) OVER THE YEARS, SEVERAL TARGETS HAVE BEEN EXPLORED TO CURB THE DISEASE. CHOLINESTERASES, NAMELY ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), REMAIN TO BE THE AVAILABLE TARGETS THAT ARE AMENDABLE TO CURRENTLY APPROVED TREATMENTS. IN THIS STUDY, A SERIES OF NOVEL COMPOUNDS BASED ON TRAMIPROSATE, A HIGHLY SPECIFIC AMYLOID BETA (AŒ≤) INHIBITOR, WAS DESIGNED TO INHIBIT ACHE, BUCHE, AND AŒ≤ AGGREGATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE ADDITION OF A PYRIDINIUM/ISOQUINOLINIUM RING TO THE TRAMIPROSATE MOIETY (TO GIVE COMPOUNDS 3A-J) LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE BINDING AFFINITY FOR THE CATALYTIC ACTIVE SITE OF CHOLINESTERASE, WHICH WAS HAMPERED BY THE PRESENCE OF SULFONIC ACID. EXCLUSION OF THE SULFONIC ACID MOIETY LED TO A NOVEL BUT EFFECTIVE CLASS OF CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS (9A-W). IN VITRO AŒ≤ AGGREGATION INHIBITION ASSAY INDICATED THAT COMPOUNDS 3A-J, 9E-F, 9I-L, 9Q, 9R, 9U-W, AND 12 COULD INHIBIT OVER 10% AŒ≤ AGGREGATION AT 1¬ÄâMM CONCENTRATION. CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION ASSAY SUGGESTED THAT COMPOUNDS 9G, 9H, 9O, AND 9Q-T EXHIBIT OVER 70% INHIBITION ON BOTH ACHE AND BUCHE AT A CONCENTRATION OF 100¬ÄâŒºM. AMONGST THE DESIGNED MOLECULES, COMPOUND 9R (CA 18% AT 1¬ÄâMM) SHOWED COMPARABLE INHIBITORY EFFECT ON THE INHIBITION OF AŒ≤ AGGREGATION WITH TRAMIPROSATE (CA 20% AT 1¬ÄâMM), ALONG WITH IMPRESSIVE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY POTENTIAL (ACHE IC  = 13¬ÄâŒºM AND BUCHE IC  = 12¬ÄâŒºM), ACCEPTABLE TOXICITY AND ABILITY TO PASS THROUGH BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER, WHICH COULD BE USED TO AMELIORATE THE PHENOTYPES OF AD IN PRECLINICAL MODELS.

BMJ MIL HEALTH 2633-3775 166 99-102 2019 10.1136/jramc-2019-001310 RECENT USES OF NERVE AGENTS UNDERLINE THE NEED OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS AS TRIGGER TO REACT (INITIATING MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES, AVOIDING CROSS-CONTAMINATION). AS ORGANOPHOSPHORUS (OP) PESTICIDE POISONING EXERTS THE SAME PATHOMECHANISM, THAT IS, INHIBITION OF THE PIVOTAL ENZYME ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), A PORTABLE CHOLINESTERASE (CHE) TEST KIT WAS APPLIED IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM FOR RAPID DIAGNOSIS OF OP POISONING. OP NERVE AGENTS OR PESTICIDES RESULT IN THE INHIBITION OF ACHE. AS ACHE IS ALSO EXPRESSED ON ERYTHROCYTES, PATIENT SAMPLES ARE EASILY AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, IN MOST CLINICS ONLY DETERMINATION OF PLASMA BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) IS ESTABLISHED WHICH LACKS A PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE, SHOWS HIGHER VARIABILITY IN THE POPULATION AND BEHAVES DIFFERENT REGARDING INHIBITION BY OP AND REACTIVATION BY OXIMES. THE CHE TEST KIT HELPED TO DIAGNOSE ATYPICAL CASES OF OP POISONING, FOR EXAMPLE, MISSING OF TYPICAL MUSCARINIC SYMPTOMS, AND RESULTED IN ADMINISTRATION OF PRALIDOXIME, THE OXIME USED IN SERBIA. THE CHE TEST KIT ALSO ALLOWS AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT WHETHER AN OXIME THERAPY IS SUCCESSFUL. IN ONE CASE REPORT, ACHE ACTIVITY INCREASED AFTER OXIME ADMINISTRATION INDICATING THERAPEUTIC SUCCESS WHEREAS BCHE ACTIVITY DID NOT. WITH ONLY BCHE AT HAND, THIS THERAPEUTIC EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN MISSED. AS INHIBITION OF ACHE OR BCHE ACTIVITY IS DETERMINED, THE CE-CERTIFIED DEVICE IS A GLOBAL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR ALL CHE INHIBITORS INCLUDING CARBAMATES WHICH MIGHT ALSO BE MISUSED AS CHEMICAL WEAPON. THE CHE TEST KIT IS A HELPFUL POINT-OF-CARE DEVICE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CHE INHIBITOR POISONING. ITS SMALL SIZE AND EASY MENU-DRIVEN USE ADVOCATE PROCUREMENT WHERE NERVE AGENT AND OP PESTICIDE EXPOSURE ARE POSSIBLE.

J CHROMATOGR A 1873-3778 1605 460371 2019 10.1016/j.chroma.2019.460371 THE GENUS PRIMULA (PRIMULACEAE) COMPRISES SPECIES WITH HIGH MEDICINAL AS WELL AS ORNAMENTAL VALUES. PLANTS BELONGING TO THIS GENUS ARE WELL RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR RICHNESS IN BIOACTIVE CONSTITUENTS. THE HUGE VARIETY OF SECONDARY METABOLITES MAKE THEIR COMPLETE ANALYSIS IMPOSSIBLE. IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THIS CHALLENGE, EFFECT-DIRECTED ANALYSIS (EDA) VIA HPTLC COUPLED TO STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION TECHNIQUES WAS APPLIED ON PRIMULA SPECIES FOR THE FIRST TIME. AS STRAIGHTFORWARD NON-TARGET BIOANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE, HPTLC-UV/VIS/FLD-EDA-ESI-HRMS HYPHENATES THREE DIFFERENT ORTHOGONAL DIMENSIONS, I.E. CHROMATOGRAPHY WITH SPECTROMETRIC DETECTION, BIOLOGICAL/ENZYMATIC ASSAYS AND HRMS. THE BIOACTIVE METABOLITES WERE DETERMINED IN THE MIDDLE POLAR EXTRACTS OF TWO PRIMULA SPECIES, P. VERIS (FLOWER) AND P. BOVEANA (LEAF). THE BIOACTIVITY PROFILING COMPRISED THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY AGAINST ALIIVIBRIO FISCHERI AND BACILLUS SUBTILIS BACTERIAL STRAINS AND ACETYL-/BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE/BCHE) INHIBITION ASSAYS. THE COMPOUNDS WERE CHARACTERIZED AND IDENTIFIED VIA THEIR RECORDED SPECTRAL DATA (HRMS AND  H NMR). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT LINOLEIC AND LINOLENIC ACIDS WERE THE PRINCIPLE BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS PRESENT IN THE STUDIED P. VERIS FLOWER EXTRACT. IN THE P. BOVEANA LEAF EXTRACT, FLAVONE, 2'-METHOXY-, 2'-HYDROXY- AND 5,6,2',6'-TETRAMETHOXYFLAVONE (ZAPOTIN) WERE DETERMINED AS ACTIVE METABOLITES. THE IDENTIFICATION OF ZAPOTIN, WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY UNDESCRIBED IN THE INVESTIGATED PLANT, WAS CONSIDERED AS THE STRENGTH OF THE STRAIGHTFORWARD NON-TARGET BIOANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE. FLAVONE TURNED OUT TO BE THE HIGHEST POTENT METABOLITE, AND AT THE SAME TIME, A MULTIPOTENT COMPOUND REFERRING TO ITS VARIOUS BIOACTIVITIES DISCOVERED. AN EQUIVALENCY CALCULATION OF THE HPTLC-ACHE INHIBITION BY FLAVONE WAS PERFORMED WITH REFERENCE TO THE WELL-KNOWN INHIBITOR RIVASTIGMINE. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF FLAVONE CONTAINED IN 10.0¬ÄØŒºG DRY POWDER OF P. BOVEANA (CORRESPONDING TO 0.1¬ÄØŒºL EXTRACT) INHIBITED AS STRONG AS 4.5¬ÄØŒºG RIVASTIGMINE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE FLAVONE CONTAINED IN P. BOVEANA LEAF EXTRACT POWDER TURNED OUT TO BE HALF AS STRONG AS THE WELL-KNOWN ACHE INHIBITOR RIVASTIGMINE.
GAWANDE V;MORLOCK G EFFECT-DIRECTED PROFILING OF FICUS RELIGIOSA LEAF EXTRACTS FOR MULTIPOTENT COMPOUNDS VIA 12 EFFECT-DIRECTED ASSAYS. J CHROMATOGR A 1873-3778 1637 461836 2020 10.1016/j.chroma.2020.461836 THE INTEREST IN THE THERAPEUTIC VALUES OF NATURAL COMPOUNDS FROM PLANTS IS GROWING WORLDWIDE BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN SYNTHETIC DRUGS HAS NOT LIVED UP TO EXPECTATIONS. THE TREE FICUS RELIGIOSA NATIVE TO INDIA, CHINA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA IS TRADITIONALLY USED FOR CURING ALMOST 50 AILMENTS, ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIVE COMPOUNDS ARE NOT KNOWN. HENCE, A HYPHENATED HIGH-PERFORMANCE THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPTLC) METHOD WAS NEWLY DEVELOPED. IT ALLOWED A PHYSICOCHEMICAL, BUT ESPECIALLY EFFECT-DIRECTED PROFILING OF INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS PRESENT IN FICUS RELIGIOSA LEAVES OBTAINED FROM FOUR LOCATIONS (IN INDIA AND GERMANY). EXTRACTS OF DIFFERENT POLARITIES WERE SCREENED FOR BIOACTIVITY RESPONSES AND MOST BIOACTIVITIES WERE FOUND IN THE ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACTS. A MULTI-IMAGING VIA 26 DIFFERENT DETECTION MODES WAS PERFORMED, I. E. UV/VIS/FLD, 11 MICROCHEMICAL DERIVATIZATIONS AND 12 EFFECT-DIRECTED ASSAYS (EDA). BY HPTLC-UV/VIS/FLD-EDA, ANTIBIOTICS AGAINST GRAM-POSITIVE AND GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA AS WELL AS ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, TYROSINASE, Œ±-AMYLASE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE AND Œ≤-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS AND RADICAL SCAVENGING COMPOUNDS WERE DETECTED. ESTROGEN-LIKE OR GENTOTOXIC COMPOUNDS WERE NOT DETECTED AT HIGHER EXTRACT AMOUNTS OF EVEN 5 MG/BAND APPLIED. FOR FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION OF THREE MOST IMPORTANT, MULTIPOTENT, BIOACTIVE COMPOUND ZONES, HPTLC WAS HYPHENATED WITH HEATED ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION HIGH-RESOLUTION MASS SPECTROMETRY INCLUDING FRAGMENTATION (HPTLC-HESI-HRMS/MS). MULTIPOTENT BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS DISCOVERED IN THE EXTRACTS WERE EQUIVALENTLY CALCULATED IN REFERENCE TO WELL-KNOWN REFERENCE INHIBITORS.

The hydrolysis of aspirin, an anionic substrate, by HuBChE was markedly increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of calcium ion (‚àº20 mM), as shown by the increasing kcat (‚àº18-fold). Butyrylthiocholine (BTC), a cationic substrate, was biphasically hydrolyzed with substrate activation; a second BTC molecule caused a 3-fold increase in kcat. At both lower and higher concentrations of BTC, its hydrolysis by HuBChE was slightly slowed down by the addition of calcium ion. Other cationic substrates, propranolol derivatives with butyryl and valeryl groups, were R-preferentially hydrolyzed by HuBChE; the rate of hydrolysis of these compounds was nearly the same in the absence and presence of calcium ion. These data indicate differential effects of calcium ion on HuBChE activity with anionic and cationic substrates. Furthermore, during the hydrolysis of aspirin in the presence of calcium ions, we demonstrated the existence of 2 additional binding sites for calcium, with Km values of 1.8 and 5.9 mM. These binding sites exhibited much lower affinities than the EF-hand motif, previously identified as a high-affinity calcium-binding site.

EXP PARASITOL 1090-2449 205 107735 2019 10.1016/j.exppara.2019.107735 TWO EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF COPPER OXIDE CAPSULES CONTROLLED HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS IN LACAUNE SHEEP WITHOUT ACUTE COLLATERAL EFFECTS ON ANIMAL HEALTH. IN EXPERIMENT 1, 48 MULTIPAROUS LACTATING SHEEP (60.1¬ÄØ¬±¬ÄØ8.5¬ÄØKG) WERE STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO INITIAL NUMBER OF EGGS (HAEMONCHUS CONTORTUS) PER GRAM OF FECES (EPG) AND WERE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO 1 OF TWO TREATMENTS (24 SHEEP/TREATMENT): NO ORAL ADMINISTRATION (CONTROL) OR ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TWO COPPER CAPSULES (TREATED; APPROXIMATELY 58¬ÄØMG COPPER/KG BODY WEIGHT). BLOOD AND FECAL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED ON DAYS 0, 15 AND 45. ANIMALS TREATED WITH COPPER CAPSULES SHOWED LOWER OF EPG, EOSINOPHILS, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) IN WHOLE BLOOD, AND LOWER BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITY IN SERUM. TREATED SHEEP HAD HIGHER ERYTHROCYTE NUMBERS, HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATIONS, HEMATOCRIT, AND LYMPHOCYTE NUMBERS. IN EXPERIMENT 2, 12 MALE LAMBS NEGATIVE FOR HELMINTHS AND COCCIDIA WERE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO ONE OF TWO TREATMENTS (SIX LAMBS/TREATMENT): CONTROL OR TREATED (ONE COPPER CAPSULE; APPROXIMATELY 58¬ÄØMG COPPER/KG BODY WEIGHT); THE EXPERIMENT WAS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT 1 WERE DUE TO TREATMENT OR PARASITISM. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED ON DAYS 0, 5, 10 AND 15 AND FECAL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED ON DAYS 0, 7 AND 15. TREATED ANIMALS SHOWED GREATER CONCENTRATIONS OF LYMPHOCYTES; HOWEVER, TREATMENT HAD NO EFFECT ON OTHER HEMOGRAM VARIABLES, ACHE AND BCHE ACTIVITIES, OR LEVELS OF ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE, ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE, GAMMA-GLUTAMYL TRANSFERASE, CREATININE, UREA, ALBUMIN, TOTAL PROTEIN, AND REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT COPPER CAPSULES IN DAIRY SHEEP EFFICIENTLY CONTROLLED H. CONTORTUS INFECTIONS. TREATMENT WAS NOT HARMFUL TO LAMBS DURING THE FIRST 15 DAYS, I.E. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF ACUTE TOXICITY.

BIOORG CHEM 1090-2120 92 103258 2019 10.1016/j.bioorg.2019.103258 ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD), A PREVALENT NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDER, IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEMENTIA. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE DRUG FOR THIS DISEASE TO DATE. PICRASMA QUASSIOIDES (D.DON) BENN, A CHINESE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE, WAS USED MAINLY FOR THE TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION, FEVER, MICROBIAL INFECTION AND DYSENTERY. IN THIS PAPER, WE REPORTED THAT THE ETOAC EXTRACT OF PICRASMA QUASSIOIDES STEMS SHOWED POTENTIAL NEUROPROTECTIVE ACTIVITIES IN L-GLUTAMATE-STIMULATED PC12 AND AŒ≤ -STIMULATED SH-SY5Y CELL MODELS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED MEMORY AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES IN AD MICE INDUCED BY AMYLOID-Œ≤ PEPTIDE. MOREOVER, IT WAS REVEALED THAT THE ANTI-AD MECHANISM WAS RELATED TO SUPPRESSING NEUROINFLAMMATORY AND REDUCING AŒ≤  DEPOSITION USING ELISA ASSAY KITS. TO CLARIFY THE ACTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE ETOAC EXTRACT OF PICRASMA QUASSIOIDES STEMS, A SYSTEMATIC PHYTOCHEMISTRY STUDY LED TO ISOLATE AND IDENTIFY SIX Œ≤-CARBOLINE ALKALOIDS (1-6), SEVEN CANTHIN-6-ONE ALKALOIDS (7-13), AND FIVE QUASSINOIDS (14-18). AMONG THEM, FOUR Œ≤-CARBOLINES (1-3, AND 6) AND SIX CANTHIN-6-ONES (7-11, AND 13) EXHIBITED POTENTIAL NEUROPROTECTIVE ACTIVITIES IN VITRO. BASED ON THESE DATE, THE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS OF ALKALOIDS WERE DISCUSSED. FURTHERMORE, MOLECULAR DOCKING EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT COMPOUNDS 2 AND 3 HAVE HIGH AFFINITY FOR BOTH OF DUAL-SPECIFICITY TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION-REGULATED KINASE 1A (DYPKIA) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE).

IN THIS WORK, THE FIRST MIP FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE DIAGNOSTICALLY RELEVANT ENZYME BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) IS PRESENTED. THE MIP WAS PREPARED USING ELECTROPOLYMERIZATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL MONOMER O-PHENYLENEDIAMINE AND WAS DEPOSITED AS A THIN FILM ON A GLASSY CARBON ELECTRODE BY OXIDATIVE POTENTIODYNAMIC POLYMERIZATION. REBINDING AND REMOVAL OF THE TEMPLATE WERE DETECTED BY CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY USING FERRICYANIDE AS A REDOX MARKER. FURTHERMORE, THE ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY OF BUCHE REBOUND TO THE MIP WAS MEASURED VIA THE ANODIC OXIDATION OF THIOCHOLINE, THE REACTION PRODUCT OF BUTYRYLTHIOCHOLINE. THE RESPONSE WAS LINEAR BETWEEN 50 PM AND 2 NM CONCENTRATIONS OF BUCHE WITH A DETECTION LIMIT OF 14.7 PM. IN ADDITION TO THE HIGH SENSITIVITY FOR BUCHE, THE SENSOR RESPONDED TOWARDS PSEUDO-IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITORS IN THE LOWER MM RANGE.

BOTH ENZYMES SHOWED THE GREATEST AFFINITY TOWARD THE METHYLIMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVE (III) OF 2-HYDROXYIMINO-N-(AZIDOPHENYLPROPYL)ACETAMIDE (I). THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE WAS DETERMINED FOR THE COMPLEX OF OXIME III WITHIN HUMAN BCHE, CONFIRMING THAT ALL THREE BINDING GROUPS INTERACTED WITH ACTIVE SITE RESIDUES. IN THE CASE OF BCHE INHIBITED BY GF, OXIMES I (KR¬Äâ=¬Äâ207¬ÄÖM-1¬ÄÖMIN-1) AND III (KR¬Äâ=¬Äâ213¬ÄÖM-1¬ÄÖMIN-1) SHOWED BETTER REACTIVATION EFFICIENCY THAN THE REFERENCE OXIME 2-PAM. FINALLY, THE KEY MECHANISTIC STEPS IN THE REACTIVATION OF GF-INHIBITED BCHE WITH OXIME III WERE MODELED USING THE PM7R6 METHOD, STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTON TRANSFER FROM NŒµ OF HIS438 TO OŒ≥ OF SER203 FOR ACHIEVING SUCCESSFUL REACTIVATION.

RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BCHE ALSO HAS A FUNCTION THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF ACH, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. LOW BCHE EXPRESSION IS ACCOMPANIED WITH HIGHER STRESS-INDUCED AGGRESSION AND GHRELIN LEVELS IN STRESS MODELS, AND BCHE KNOCKOUT MICE EXHIBIT COGNITIVE AND MEMORY IMPAIRMENTS. HOWEVER, THE ROLE¬†OF BCHE IN POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) REMAINS UNCLEAR. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF BCHE IN CONTEXTUAL FEAR MEMORY AND ITS REGULATORY EFFECT ON THE EXPRESSION OF FACTORS RELATED TO THE GLUTAMATE (GLU)-GLUTAMINE (GLN) CYCLE   KNOCKDOWN STUDIES. WE USED AAVS AND LENTIVIRUSES TO KNOCKDOWN BCHE EXPRESSION IN THE MOUSE HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 REGION AND C8D1A ASTROCYTES. OUR BEHAVIORAL DATA FROM THOSE MICE INJECTED WITH AAV-SHBCHE IN THE HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 REGION SHOWED STRENGTHENED FEAR MEMORY AND INCREASED DENDRITIC SPINE DENSITY. ELEVATED GLU LEVELS AND GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE (GS) ENZYME ACTIVITY WERE DETECTED IN CONTEXTUAL FEAR CONDITIONED-BCHE KNOCKDOWN ANIMALS AND ASTROCYTES. WE OBSERVED THAT AN AAV-SHBCHE INDUCED LOWERING OF BCHE EXPRESSION IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS CA1 REGION ENHANCED CONTEXTUAL FEAR MEMORY EXPRESSION AND PROMOTED THE ASTROCYTIC GLU-GLN CYCLE BUT DID NOT ELEVATE ACH-HYDROLYZING ACTIVITY. THIS STUDY PROVIDES NEW INSIGHT INTO THE REGULATORY ROLE OF BCHE IN COGNITION AND SUGGESTS POTENTIAL TARGET FOR STRESS-RELATED PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER SUCH AS PTSD WHERE PATIENTS EXPERIENCE FEAR AFTER EXPOSURE TO SEVERE LIFE-THREATENING TRAUMATIC EVENTS.

THE NEW DUAL-PROMOTER CONSTRUCTION (PBUDCE DUAL BCHE) INCLUDING TWO COPIES OF THE   GENE WAS DESIGNED AND TRANSFECTED INTO CELLS BY LIPOSOMAL STRUCTURES. THE CLONED PLASMIDS WERE EVALUATED BY ENZYME DIGESTION AND GEL ELECTROPHORESIS ANALYSIS. EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WERE CATEGORIZED INTO THE CELLS TRANSFECTED BY PBUDCE DUAL BCHE (TREATMENT), PCMV (POSITIVE CONTROL) VECTORS, AND NONTRANSFECTED CELLS (NEGATIVE CONTROL).   GENE EXPRESSION WAS EVALUATED BY QRT-PCR AND THE ENZYME ACTIVITY WAS ASSESSED USING MODIFIED ELLMAN'S METHOD. THE FREEZE-THAW PROCESS WAS CARRIED OUT FOR ANALYZING THE STABILITY OF THE PBUDCE DUAL BCHE VECTOR. VALIDATION EXAMINATION OF THE CLONED PLASMIDS CONFIRMED THE SUCCESSFUL CLONING PROCESS. THE GENE EXPRESSION LEVEL AND ELLMAN'S METHOD VALUE IN PBUDCE DUAL BCHE WAS HIGHER THAN THE OTHER GROUPS. CMV PROMOTER HAS ALSO INCREASED THE ENZYME ACTIVITY, ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. INTERESTINGLY, FREEZE-THAW CYCLES FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL PASSAGES DID NOT AFFECT THE ENZYME ACTIVITY. THE DESIGNED CONSTRUCTION WITH CMV AND EF-1Œ± PROMOTERS COULD INCREASE BCHE GENE EXPRESSION AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE BCHE ENZYME IN HEK-293 CELL LINE. LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF BCHE ENZYME CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING DUAL-PROMOTER PLASMID CONSTRUCTION COMPARED TO A SINGLE-PROMOTER VECTOR TO BE USED IN CLINICAL TRIALS.

DRUG DES DEVEL THER 1177-8881 13 3485-3495 2019 10.2147/DDDT.S225311 IN THIS STUDY, 2 SYMMETRICAL AND 3 UNSYMMETRICAL THIOUREAS WERE SYNTHESIZED TO EVALUATE THEIR ANTIOXIDANT, ANTIBACTERIAL, ANTIDIABETIC, AND ANTICHOLINESTERASE POTENTIALS. THE SYMMETRICAL THIOUREAS WERE SYNTHESIZED IN AQUEOUS MEDIA IN THE PRESENCE OF SUNLIGHT, USING AMINES AND CS  AS STARTING MATERIAL. THE UNSYMMETRICAL THIOUREAS WERE SYNTHESIZED USING AMINES AS A NUCLEOPHILE TO ATTACK THE PHENYL ISOTHIOCYANATE (ELECTROPHILE). THE STRUCTURES OF SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS WERE CONFIRMED THROUGH H  NMR. THE ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL WAS DETERMINED USING DPPH AND ABTS ASSAYS. THE INHIBITION OF GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE, ALPHA AMYLASE, AND ALPHA GLUCOSIDASE BY SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS WAS USED AS AN INDICATION OF ANTIDIABETIC POTENTIAL. ANTICHOLINESTERASE POTENTIAL WAS DETERMINED FROM THE INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE BY THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS. THE HIGHEST INHIBITION OF GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE WAS SHOWN BY COMPOUND   (03.12 MG OF PHOSPHATE RELEASED). ALPHA AMYLASE WAS MOST POTENTLY INHIBITED BY COMPOUND   WITH IC  VALUE OF 62 ¬µG/ML WHILE ALPHA GLUCOSIDASE BY COMPOUND   WITH IC  VALUE OF 75 ¬µG/ML.

Cer√≥n-Carrasco") Evaluation of butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity by chlorogenic acids and coffee extracts assed in ITC and docking simulation models Food Research International 0963-9969 109 268-277 2018 10.1016/j.foodres.2018.04.041 In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), elevated levels of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are observed. The enzyme hydrolyses acetylcholine, which shows deficiency in these patients. Therefore, BChE inhibitors are used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, especially synthetic ones, showing side effects with long-term intake. The sources of natural BChE inhibitors are constantly being sought. Coffee brews have been shown to reduce the symptoms of AD in epidemiological studies. However, the ability to inhibit BChE activity has not been investigated, depending on the degree of coffee roasting. The study was aimed at determining the interactions between BChE and the bioactive compounds of coffee and their ability to inhibit the activity of BChE. A comparison of individual bioactive compounds of coffee as well as extracts obtained from two main species, Arabica and Robusta, and additionally from different degrees of roasting was made. Two models were used: isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and molecular docking simulation. ITC analysis showed strong interactions of ferulic and dihydrocaffeic acids with BChE. These compounds are the metabolites of the chlorogenic acids, including both mono- and diesters of caffeic acid with quinic acid. Docking simulation showed their strong hydrophobic interaction with BChE, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions. After introducing acetylcholine into the model system, the strongest ability to inhibit hydrolytic activity of BChE was again observed for ferulic acid and additionally for 3-caffeoylquinic acid, and among coffee brews the most active were light roasted Arabica and green Robusta. The study was based on the physiological concentrations of coffee components, so the potential therapeutic effect of coffee infusions was proved.

There is an increasing interest in the development of BChE inhibitors. In the present study, a set of pharmacophore models for BChE was developed and validated. Based on the models, virtual screening was performed on five compound collections, from which seventeen potential hits were retained for biological investigation. In total, eight of these seventeen potential hits showed selective BChE inhibitory activity. Moreover, four compounds displayed IC50 values in sub-micromolar range on eqBChE and three displayed IC50 values <‚ÄØ2‚ÄØŒºM on huBChE. The diverse scaffolds of the active compounds provided good starting point further development of selective BChE inhibitors. As far as we concerned, here we disclose the first selective pharmacophore model targeting BChE. The high rate of the model in the identification of active hits indicates it is a valuable tool for the development of selective BChE inhibitors, which may benefit the treatment of AD.

IN THE PRESENT WORK, A LIBRARY OF 3-HYDROXY-3-PHENACYLOXINDOLE ANALOGS WAS SCREENED FOR FAAH AND CHES (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE [ACHE]/BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE [BUCHE]) INHIBITION. 1-BENZYL-3-HYDROXY-3-(2',4'-DIBROMOPHENACYL)OXINDOLE (16), THE MOST PROMISING COMPOUND, SHOWED A BALANCED MULTIFUNCTIONAL PROFILE WITH FAAH (IC  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ8.7¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ0.3¬ÄâNM, COMPETITIVE AND REVERSIBLE), ACHE (IC  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ28¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ3¬ÄâNM, MIXED AND REVERSIBLE), AND BUCHE (IC  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ65¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ8¬ÄâNM, MIXED AND REVERSIBLE) INHIBITION. THE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP STUDY PREDICTED MULTIFARIOUS FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS CRUCIAL FOR THE POTENCY OF THESE ANALOGS. FURTHERMORE, THE STRUCTURAL GEOMETRY AND RIGIDNESS BESTOWED BY THE OXINDOLE MOIETY RESULTED IN IMPROVED ADHERENCE OF THE COMPOUNDS WITHIN THE BINDING POCKETS OF THE TARGET ENZYMES. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES OF THE DOCKED CONFORMATIONS ACKNOWLEDGED NUMEROUS INTERACTIONS FOR TRENCHANT STABILIZATION OF INHIBITOR-ENZYME COMPLEXES. BINDING INTERACTION AND CONFORMATIONAL ALIGNMENT STUDIES OF STEREOISOMERS OF THE LEAD INHIBITORS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE (S)-STEREOCHEMISTRY AT C-3 OF THE OXINDOLE SCAFFOLD FOR POTENCY AND SELECTIVITY.

IN THIS STUDY, THE EFFECT OF THREE SOLVENTS (ETHANOL, ETHANOL/WATER AND WATER) ON THE PHENOLIC COMPOSITION, ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES AND ELECTROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR OF FOUR WINEMAKING BYPRODUCTS (SEEDS, SKINS, STEMS, AND POMACE) WAS EVALUATED. PHENOLIC COMPOSITION WAS DETERMINED BY THE FOLIN-CIOCALTEU METHOD AND ULTRA-HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (UHPLC), ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY BY THE CAPACITY TO SCAVENGE 2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL AND HYDROXYL RADICALS, ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY BY THE ELLMAN'S METHOD, AND ELECTROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR BY CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY. EIGHT PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS WERE QUANTIFIED WITH HIGHER CONTENT IN WATER/ETHANOL EXTRACTS (E.G., EPICATECHIN IN POMACE: 17 MG/100 G VS. 7 AND 6 MG/100 G IN ETHANOL AND WATER EXTRACTS, RESPECTIVELY), ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME EXCEPTIONS (E.G., GALLIC ACID IN SEEDS WAS MOST ABUNDANT IN WATER EXTRACTS). MOREOVER, THE HIGHEST TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT (TPC) AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WERE FOUND IN ETHANOL/WATER EXTRACTS (BETWEEN 2 AND 30-FOLD THE VALUES OF THE OTHER EXTRACTS). OVERALL, THE MOST ACTIVE EXTRACTS IN INHIBITING BOTH ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ENZYMES WERE ETHANOL/WATER AND ETHANOL EXTRACTS FROM SEEDS (BETWEEN 31.11 AND 53.90%). THE ELECTROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR ALLOWED FOR DIFFERENTIATING THE EXTRACTS DEPENDING ON THE SOLVENT AND THE BYPRODUCT. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT WINEMAKING BYPRODUCTS REPRESENT A SOURCE OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS WITH ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES AND SUGGEST THAT CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY IS A PROMISING TECHNIQUE TO EVALUATE THE PHENOLIC EXTRACTION PROCESS FROM THESE BYPRODUCTS.

The general formula of the amides is C5H5FeC5H4C6H4NHCOC6H4(OCH3). The synthesized compounds were characterized by instrumental techniques like elemental analysis, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. Structure of the two compounds was also studied by single crystal X-rays diffraction analysis. Structural studies provide the evidence that pMeO (one of the synthesized compounds) is an example of amides having no intermolecular hydrogen bonding in solid structure. In the BChE inhibition assay, compound (oMeO) having strong intermolecular force in the solid structure is less active than the compound (pMeO) with weak intermolecular forces in the solid structure. The docking studies proved that hydrogen bonding between inhibitor and BChE enzyme is of more importance for the activity, rather than intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the solid structure of inhibitor.

In this context, a series of varyingly substituted flavonols and 4-thioflavonols have been designed and synthesized efficiently. All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized unambiguously by common spectroscopic techniques (IR, 1H-, 13C NMR) and mass spectrometry (EI-MS). All the derivatives (1‚Äì24) were evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory potential against cholinesterase enzymes. The results exhibited that these derivatives were potent selective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), except the compound 11 which was selective inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), with varying degree of IC50 values. Remarkably, the compounds 20 and 23 have been found the most potent almost dual inhibitors of AChE and BChE amongst the series with IC50 values even less than the standard drug. The experimental results in silico were further validated by molecular docking studies in order to find their binding modes with the active pockets of AChE and BChE enzymes.

NIO-NPS WERE ANNEALED AT 300¬Äâ¬∞C, 400¬Äâ¬∞C AND 500¬Äâ¬∞C WHILE THEIR PHYSIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES WERE ESTABLISHED BY HR-SEM/TEM, UV, XRD, FTIR, EDS, SAED AND SQUID TECHNIQUES. PARTICLE SIZE OF NIO-NPS DECREASED WITH INCREASE IN ANNEALING TEMPERATURES. MAGNETIZATION CURVES INDICATED SUPERPARAMAGNETIC BEHAVIOR OF THE BIOGENIC NIO-NPS AT 300¬ÄâK. HIGHLY CRYSTALLINE NIO-NPS OBTAINED AFTER ANNEALING AT 500¬Äâ¬∞C WERE USED FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS. THE ANTI-LEISHMANIAL ACTIVITY ON   PROMASTIGOTES (KMH-23) AND ANTICANCER ACTIVITY ON HEPG2 (RCB1648) REVEALED EXCELLENT INHIBITION POTENTIAL WITH IC  OF 37.21¬Äâ¬µG/ML AND 47¬Äâ¬µG/ML, RESPECTIVELY. SIGNIFICANT ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT WAS OBSERVED AGAINST   AND   WITH MIC'S OF 12.5¬Äâ¬µG/ML EACH. ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORY POTENTIAL WERE COMPARABLE WITH POSITIVE CONTROL DRUGS. MODERATE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES WERE OBSERVED. NIO-NPS WERE OBSERVED TO BE HEMOLYTIC (30%) AT HIGHER DOSE (1000¬Äâ¬µG/ML). OVERALL, NIO-NPS REVEALED A MULTIFUNCTIONAL NATURE THAT CAN BE EXPLORED FOR DIVERSE BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS.COMMUNICATED BY RAMASWAMY H. SARMA.

THE CHOLINERGIC HYPOTHESIS PROVIDED OVER THE YEARS WITH MOLECULAR TARGETS FOR DEVELOPING PALLIATIVE TREATMENTS FOR AD, ACTING ON THE CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM, NAMELY, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND Œ±7 NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR (Œ±7 NACHR). IN OUR SYNTHETIC WORK, WE USED "CLICK-CHEMISTRY" TO SYNTHESIZE TWO MULTI TARGET DIRECTED LIGANDS (MTDLS) MB105 AND MB118 CARRYING TACRINE AND QUINUCLIDINE SCAFFOLDS WHICH ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR ANTICHOLINESTERASE AND Œ±7 NACHR AGONIST ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY. BOTH, MB105 AND MB118, INHIBIT HUMAN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE IN THE NANOMOLAR RANGE. ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS ON XENOPUS LAEVIS OOCYTES EXPRESSING HUMAN Œ±7 NACHR SHOWED THAT MB105 AND MB118 ACTED AS PARTIAL AGONISTS OF THE REFERRED NICOTINIC RECEPTOR, ALBEIT, WITH DIFFERENT POTENCIES DESPITE THEIR SIMILAR STRUCTURE. THE DIFFERENT SUBSTITUTION AT C-3 ON THE 2,3-DISUBSTITUTED QUINUCLIDINE SCAFFOLD MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POTENCY OF MB118 COMPARED TO MB105. ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS ALSO SHOWED THAT THE TACRINE PRECURSOR MB320 BEHAVED AS A COMPETITIVE ANTAGONIST OF HUMAN Œ±7 NACHR, IN THE MICROMOLAR RANGE, WHILE THE QUINUCLIDINE SYNTHETIC PRECURSOR MB099 ACTED AS A PARTIAL AGONIST. TAKEN ALL TOGETHER, MB105 BEHAVED AS A PARTIAL AGONIST OF Œ±7 NACHR AT CONCENTRATIONS WHERE IT COMPLETELY INHIBITED HUMAN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY PAVING THE WAY FOR THE DESIGN OF NOVEL MTDLS FOR PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF AD.

BIOORG CHEM 1090-2120 100 103928 2019 10.1016/j.bioorg.2020.103928 A NOVEL SERIES OF AROMATIC ESTERS (1A-1M) RELATED TO THE AMARYLLIDACEAE ALKALOID (AA) HAEMANTHAMINE WERE DESIGNED, SYNTHESIZED AND TESTED IN VITRO WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. SOME OF THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS REVEALED PROMISING ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) INHIBITORY PROFILE. SIGNIFICANT HUMAN ACHE (HACHE) INHIBITION WAS DEMONSTRATED BY 11-O-(3-NITROBENZOYL)HAEMANTHAMINE (1J) WITH IC VALUE OF 4.0¬†¬±¬†0.3¬†¬µM. THE STRONGEST HUMAN BUCHE (HBUCHE) INHIBITION GENERATED 1-O-(2-METHOXYBENZOYL)HAEMANTHAMINE (1G) WITH IC  VALUE 3.3¬†¬±¬†0.4¬†¬µM. MOREOVER, 11-O-(2-CHLORBENZOYL)HAEMANTHAMINE (1M) WAS ABLE TO INHIBIT BOTH ENZYMES IN DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER. THE MODE OF HACHE AND HBUCHE INHIBITION WAS MINUTELY INSPECTED USING ENZYME KINETIC ANALYSIS IN TANDEM WITH IN SILICO EXPERIMENTS, THE LATTER ELUCIDATING CRUCIAL INTERACTION IN 1J-, 1M-HACHE AND 1G-, 1M-HBUCHE COMPLEXES. THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) PERMEABILITY WAS INVESTIGATED APPLYING THE PARALLEL ARTIFICIAL MEMBRANE PERMEATION ASSAY (PAMPA) TO PREDICT THE CNS AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS.

ACS CHEM NEUROSCI 1948-7193 11 3557-3574 2020 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00448 THE INADEQUATE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF THE PRESENT ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) DRUGS AND THEIR LOW IMPACT ON THE PROGRESSION OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN PATIENTS HAVE REVISED THE RESEARCH FOCUS FROM SINGLE TARGETS TO MULTITARGET-DIRECTED LIGANDS. A NOVEL SERIES OF SUBSTITUTED TRIAZINOINDOLE DERIVATIVES WERE OBTAINED BY INTRODUCING VARIOUS SUBSTITUENTS ON THE INDOLE RING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTITARGET-DIRECTED LIGANDS AS ANTI-AD AGENTS. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA INDICATED THAT SOME OF THESE COMPOUNDS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT ANTI-AD PROPERTIES. AMONG THEM, 8-(PIPERIDIN-1-YL)- -(6-(PYRROLIDIN-1-YL)HEXYL)-5 -[1,2,4]TRIAZINO[5,6- ]INDOL-3-AMINE ( ), THE MOST POTENT CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR (ACHE, IC  VALUE OF 0.32 ŒºM; BUCHE, IC  VALUE OF 0.21 ŒºM), WAS ALSO FOUND TO POSSESS SIGNIFICANT SELF-MEDIATED AŒ≤  AGGREGATION INHIBITORY ACTIVITY (54% AT 25 ŒºM CONCENTRATION). ADDITIONALLY, COMPOUND   SHOWED STRONG ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY. IN THE PAMPA ASSAY, COMPOUND   EXHIBITED BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PENETRATING ABILITY. AN ACUTE TOXICITY STUDY IN RATS DEMONSTRATED NO SIGN OF TOXICITY AT DOSES UP TO 2000 MG/KG. FURTHERMORE, COMPOUND   SIGNIFICANTLY RESTORED THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN THE SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED MICE MODEL AND AŒ≤ -INDUCED RAT MODEL. IN THE   ADMET PREDICTION STUDIES, THE COMPOUND SATISFIED ALL THE PARAMETERS OF CNS ACTING DRUGS. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHTED THE POTENTIAL OF COMPOUND   TO BE A PROMISING MULTITARGET-DIRECTED LIGAND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL ANTI-AD DRUGS.

BIOORG CHEM 1090-2120 104 104215 2020 10.1016/j.bioorg.2020.104215 DUE TO THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPY OPTIONS TO TREATS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, NEW STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN APPROACHED IN THE SEARCH FOR MULTI-TARGET MOLECULES AS THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS. IN THIS WORK, FOUR INDOLE ALKALOIDS, GEISSOSCHIZOLINE, GEISSOSCHIZONE, GEISSOSPERMINE, AND 3',4',5',6'-TETRADEHYDROGEISSOSPERMINE WERE ISOLATED FROM GEISSOSPERMUM VELLOSII (PAO PEREIRA) AND EVALUATED FOR THEIR ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES. WHILE GEISSOSPERMINE INHIBITED ONLY BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), THE OTHER ALKALOIDS BEHAVED AS NON-SELECTIVE INHIBITORS OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BCHE. IN CELL VIABILITY TESTS, ONLY GEISSOSCHIZOLINE WAS NOT CYTOTOXIC. THEREFORE, GEISSOSCHIZOLINE ACTIONS WERE ALSO EVALUATED IN HUMAN CHOLINESTERASES, WHERE IT WAS TWICE AS POTENT INHIBITOR OF HBCHE (IC ¬†=¬†10.21¬†¬±¬†0.01¬†¬µM) THAN HACHE (IC ¬†=¬†20.40¬†¬±¬†0.93¬†¬µM). ON ENZYME KINETIC STUDIES, GEISSOSCHIZOLINE PRESENTED A MIXED-TYPE INHIBITION MECHANISM FOR BOTH ENZYMES. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES POINTED INTERACTIONS OF GEISSOSCHIZOLINE WITH ACTIVE SITE AND PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE OF HACHE AND HBCHE, INDICATING A DUAL SITE INHIBITOR PROFILE. MOREOVER, GEISSOSCHIZOLINE ALSO PLAYED A PROMISING ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ROLE, REDUCING MICROGLIAL RELEASE OF NO AND TNF-Œ± AT A CONCENTRATION (1¬†ŒºM) TEN AND TWENTY TIMES LOWER THAN THE IC  VALUES OF HBCHE AND HACHE INHIBITION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ACTIONS GIVE GEISSOSCHIZOLINE A STRONG NEUROPROTECTIVE CHARACTER. IN ADDITION, THE ABILITY TO INHIBIT HACHE AND HBCHE, WITH APPROXIMATE INHIBITORY POTENCIES, ACCREDITS THIS ALKALOID FOR THERAPEUTIC USE IN THE MODERATE TO SEVERE PHASE OF AD. THUS, GEISSOSCHIZOLINE EMERGES AS A POSSIBLE MULTI-TARGET PROTOTYPE THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL IN PREVENTING NEURODEGENERATION AND RESTORE NEUROTRANSMISSION.

BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF KINETIC CURVES OF THERMAL INACTIVATION, MECHANISMS OF THERMAL INACTIVATION OF ENZYMES IN A VISCOUS MICROENVIRONMENT ARE PROPOSED. USING THE EXAMPLE OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, NAD(P)H:FMN OXIDOREDUCTASE, AND COUPLED SYSTEM OF THE LUMINOUS BACTERIA (NAD(P)H:FMN OXIDOREDUCTASE + LUCIFERASE), THE CONDITIONS, UNDER WHICH STARCH AND GELATIN HAVE A STABILIZING EFFECT ON ENZYME ACTIVITY DURING STORAGE AND EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, WERE FOUND. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE STABILIZING EFFECT IS ACHIEVED BY ELIMINATING WATER DURING DRYING THE ENZYME PREPARATIONS IMMOBILIZED IN STARCH AND GELATIN POLYMER GELS.

THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF DEMENTIA IN ADULTS ARE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD), DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES (DLB), FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA (FTD) AND VASCULAR DEMENTIA (VAD), OF WHICH, AD ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE CASES. THE MOST PROMINENT SYMPTOM OF AD IS COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, CURRENTLY TREATED WITH FOUR DRUGS: DONEPEZIL, RIVASTIGMINE, AND GALANTAMINE, ENHANCING CHOLINERGIC TRANSMISSION; AS WELL AS MEMANTINE, PROTECTING NEURONS AGAINST GLUTAMATE EXCITOTOXICITY. DESPITE ONGOING EFFORTS, NO NEW DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF AD HAVE BEEN REGISTERED FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS, THUS MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON GENETIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE EFFICACY OF ANTIDEMENTIA PHARMACOTHERAPY. THE RESEARCHERS INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF VARIANTS IN MULTIPLE GENES, SUCH AS ABCB1, ACE, CHAT, CHRNA7, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, NR1I2, NR1I3, POR, PPAR, RXR, SLC22A1/2/5, SLC47A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 AND UGT2B7, ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS PATHWAYS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF PATHOLOGICAL PROTEINS, FORMATION AND METABOLISM OF ACETYLCHOLINE, TRANSPORT, METABOLISM AND EXCRETION OF ANTIDEMENTIA DRUGS AND TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS REGULATING THE EXPRESSION OF GENES RESPONSIBLE FOR METABOLISM AND TRANSPORT OF DRUGS. THE MOST PROMISING RESULTS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR APOE E4, DEMENTIA RISK VARIANT, BCHE-K, REDUCED BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY VARIANT, AND CYP2D6 UM, ULTRARAPID HEPATIC METABOLISM. FURTHER STUDIES INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGING DRUGS OR GENETIC EDITING BY CRISPR/CAS9 FOR CAUSATIVE TREATMENT. IN CONCLUSION, THE PHARMACOGENETIC STUDIES ON DEMENTIA DISEASES MAY IMPROVE THE EFFICACY OF PHARMACOTHERAPY IN SOME PATIENTS WITH BENEFICIAL GENETIC VARIANTS, AT THE SAME TIME, IDENTIFYING THE CARRIERS OF UNFAVORABLE ALLELES, THE POTENTIAL GROUP OF NOVEL APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF DEMENTIA.

WE IDENTIFIED PATIENTS WITH GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES TO ANAESTHETIC COMPLICATIONS USING A PERIOPERATIVE BIOREPOSITORY AND CHARACTERISED THE CONCORDANCE WITH EXISTING DIAGNOSES. ADULT PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY WITHIN MICHIGAN MEDICINE FROM 2012 TO 2017 WERE CONSENTED FOR GENOTYPING. GENOTYPES WERE INTEGRATED WITH THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR). WE RETROSPECTIVELY CHARACTERISED FREQUENCIES OF VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY, FACTOR V LEIDEN, AND MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA, THREE PHARMACOGENETIC FACTORS WITH PERIOPERATIVE IMPLICATIONS. WE CALCULATED THE PERCENTAGE HOMOZYGOUS AND HETEROZYGOUS FOR EACH THAT HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED PREVIOUSLY AND SEARCHED FOR EHR FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH A PREDISPOSITION. ANALYSIS OF GENETIC DATA REVEALED THAT 25 OUT OF 40 769 (0.1%) PATIENTS WERE HOMOZYGOUS AND 1918 (4.7%) WERE HETEROZYGOUS FOR MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY. OF THE HOMOZYGOUS INDIVIDUALS, 14 (56%) CARRIED A PRE-EXISTING DIAGNOSIS. FOR FACTOR V LEIDEN, 29 (0.1%) WERE HOMOZYGOUS AND 2153 (5.3%) HETEROZYGOUS. OF THE HOMOZYGOUS INDIVIDUALS, THREE (10%) WERE DIAGNOSED BY EHR-DERIVED PHENOTYPE AND SIX (21%) BY CLINICIAN REVIEW. MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA WAS ASSESSED IN A SUBSET OF PATIENTS. WE DETECTED TWO PATIENTS WITH ASSOCIATED MUTATIONS. NEITHER CARRIED CLINICAL DIAGNOSES. WE IDENTIFIED PATIENTS WITH GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS USING AN OPEN SOURCE SCRIPT DESIGNED FOR CLINICIAN USE. WE VALIDATED THIS APPLICATION IN A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS FOR THREE CONDITIONS WITH WELL-CHARACTERISED INHERITANCE, AND SHOWED THAT NOT ALL GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES WERE DOCUMENTED IN THE EHR.

IN THIS WORK, WE INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF NATURE-INSPIRED GLUCOSYLPOLYPHENOLS AGAINST RELEVANT TARGETS, INCLUDING ISLET AMYLOID POLYPEPTIDE, GLUCOSIDASES, AND CHOLINESTERASES. MOREOVER, WITH THE PREMISE OF FYN KINASE AS A PARADIGM-SHIFTING TARGET IN ALZHEIMER'S DRUG DISCOVERY, WE EXPLORE GLUCOSYLPOLYPHENOLS AS BLOCKERS OF AŒ≤-INDUCED FYN KINASE ACTIVATION WHILE LOOKING INTO DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS LEADING TO TAU HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION. SEVERAL COMPOUNDS INHIBIT AŒ≤-INDUCED FYN KINASE ACTIVATION AND DECREASE PTAU LEVELS AT 10 ŒºM CONCENTRATION, PARTICULARLY THE PER- -METHYLATED GLUCOSYLACETOPHLOROGLUCINOL AND THE 4-GLUCOSYLCATECHOL DIBENZOATE, THE LATTER INHIBITING ALSO BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND Œ≤-GLUCOSIDASE.

IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT A FLUORESCENT SENSING PLATFORM FOR SENSITIVE DETECTION OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). THE FLUORESCENCE OF AUNCS CAN BE QUENCHED BY IRON OXYHYDROXIDE (FEOOH) NANOMATERIALS. IN THE PRESENCE OF BCHE AND ACETYLTHIOCHOLINE (ATCH), NANO-FEOOH CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DECOMPOSED BY THE ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSATE (THIOCHOLINE), LEADING TO THE RECOVERY OF AUNCS FLUORESCENCE. THE AU/FEOOH EXHIBITS THE HIGHEST FLUORESCENCE QUENCHING EFFICIENCY COMPARED WITH OTHER TRANSITION METAL OXYHYDROXIDE-BASED SENSING SYSTEMS, E.G., AU/COOOH AND AU/NIOOH. THE CORRESPONDING FLUORESCENCE RECOVERY EFFICIENCY IS ALSO THE BEST FOR AU/FEOOH. THE LARGE SURFACE AREA OF NANOMATERIALS AND THIN NANOSTRUCTURE PROVIDE A FAVORABLE PLATFORM FOR THE REACTION OF ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSATE AND EVENTUALLY IMPROVE THE HIGH SENSITIVITY OF THE PROBE. A LINEAR DETECTION RANGE FOR BCHE IS ACHIEVED WITHIN 5-100 NG ML  ALONG WITH A DETECTION LIMIT OF 4 NG ML . BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH SENSITIVITY, THE AU/FEOOH WAS SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR BCHE QUANTIFICATION IN 2 ŒºL OF FINGER BLOOD.

It provides protection against administrated or inhaled poisons by hydrolyzing or sequestering the toxic compounds. The most frequent genetic variant of BCHE gene ‚Äì K variant (p.A539T) is located in the C-terminal tetramerization domain, outside of the catalytic center. Many studies tried to reveal the nature of the lower activity of BChE K-variant but results and conclusions were often contradictory. The aim of this study is to estimate K allele frequency and its coexisting alterations in BCHE gene in a population of 162 individuals, as well as, assess influence on the enzyme activity in serum. We present three haplotypes of BChE-K variant, two of them coexist in strong linkage disequilibrium with alterations in 5‚Ä≤UTR (rs1126680), intron 2 (rs55781031) or in exon 2 (rs1799807). We demonstrate a negative role of these alterations on enzyme activity. By oneself BCHE-K (with no other alterations in BCHE gene) haplotype exhibits wild type enzyme activity. Based on our previous and presented results we conclude that SNPs localized outside the coding sequence, in 5‚Ä≤UTR or/and in intron 2 of BCHE gene, but not solely in K-variant alteration (p.A539T) itself, are responsible for reduced enzyme activity.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF CAFFEIC ACID (CFA) AND CHLOROGENIC ACID (CGA) ON RATS FED WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL DIET (HCD). EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS WERE FED WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL DIET (HCD) FOR A PERIOD OF 21¬†DAYS WHILE SIMVASTATIN (0.2¬†MG/KG BWT), CFA AND CGA (10 AND 15¬†MG/KG BWT) WERE ADMINISTERED DAILY. ACTIVITY OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND ARGINASE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.05) HIGHER IN THE RATS FED WITH HCD ALONE. ALSO, LEVEL OF MALONDIADEHYDE EQUIVALENT COMPOUNDS (MDA) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.05) ELEVATED IN HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC RATS. NEVERTHELESS, TREATMENT WITH SIMVASTATIN, CFA AND CGA NORMALIZED ALTERED ACHE, BCHE AND ARGINASE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS IMPROVED ANTIOXIDANT STATUS IN HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC RATS. CFA AND CGA COULD OFFER PROTECTIVE ROLE IN HYPERCHOLESETEROLEMIC RATS VIA THEIR ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIALS AS WELL AS RESTORING ALTERED ACTIVITY OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND ARGINASE. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS CHLOROGENIC ACID EXHIBITS BETTER ATTRIBUTE.

Thus, we aimed to synthesize novel cholinesterases inhibitors considering structural differences in their peripheral site, exploiting a moiety replacement approach based on the potent and selective hAChE drug donepezil. Hence, two small series of N-benzylpiperidine based compounds have successfully been synthesized as novel potent and selective hBuChE inhibitors. The most promising compounds (9 and 11) were not cytotoxic and their kinetic study accounted for dual binding site mode of interaction, which is in agreement with further docking and molecular dynamics studies. Therefore, this study demonstrates how our strategy enabled the discovery of novel promising and privileged structures. Remarkably, compound 11 proved to be one of the most potent (0.17‚ÄØnM) and selective (>58,000-fold) hBuChE inhibitor ever reported.

THEIR CHEMICAL STRUCTURES WERE DETERMINED BASED ON NMR AND MS SPECTROSCOPIC DATA ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS SINGLE X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. THE GERANYLATED COMPOUNDS, COWANIN (13), COWAGARCINONE E (15), NORCOWANIN (16) AND COWANOL (17) EXHIBITED POTENT INHIBITIONS AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) (IC  0.33-1.09¬ÄØŒºM) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) (IC  0.048-1.84¬ÄØŒºM), WHICH WERE MORE ACTIVE THAN THE REFERENCE DRUG, GALANTHAMINE. COMPOUND 15 WAS HIGHLY POTENT BCHE INHIBITOR (IC  0.048¬ÄØŒºM) AND WAS 76-FOLD MORE POTENT THAN THE DRUG. STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP STUDIES INDICATED THAT THE C-2 PRENYL AND C-8 GERANYL SUBSTITUENTS IN THE TETRAOXYGENATED SCAFFOLD ARE IMPORTANT FOR HIGH ACTIVITY. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES REVEALED THAT THE LEADS 13 AND 15-17 SHOWED SIMILAR BINDING ORIENTATIONS ON BOTH ENZYMES AND VERY WELL-FITTED AT THE DOUBLE BINDING ACTIVE SITES OF PAS AND CAS WITH STRONG HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS FROM BOTH ISOPRENYL SIDE CHAINS.

The inhibitory potential of all derivatives against two cholinesterases was evaluated. Only a few compounds demonstrated AChE inhibitory activity at the tested concentrations, while 26 compounds showed significant inhibition on BChE (the IC50 values varied from 9.34‚ÄØŒºM to 0.093‚ÄØŒºM), most of them presented promising selectivity to ward BChE. Prediction of ADME properties for 7 most active compounds was performed. Among them, 9g (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ222‚ÄØnM) and 9h (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ93‚ÄØnM) were found to be the most potent BChE inhibitors with excellent selectivity over AChE (SI ratio‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1339 and 836, respectively). The kinetic analysis demonstrated both of them acted as mixed-type BChE inhibitors, while the molecular docking results indicated that they interacted with both residues in the catalytic active site. A cytotoxicity test on PC12 cells showed that both 9g and 9h had a therapeutic safety range similar to tacrine. Overall, the results indicate that 9h could be a good candidate of BChE inhibitors.

BASED ON THE CHOLINERGIC HYPOTHESIS, AND XRAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DETERMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) ENZYME, THE LEVEL OF ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH, AN IMPORTANT NEUROTRANSMITTER ASSOCIATED WITH MEMORY) IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND CORTEX AREA OF THE BRAIN HAS A DIRECT EFFECT ON ALZHEIMER. THIS FACT ENCOURAGES SCIENTISTS TO DESIGN AND SYNTHESIZE A WIDE RANGE OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS (ACHEIS) TO CONTROL THE LEVEL OF ACH IN THE BRAIN, KEEPING IN VIEW THE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE OF ACHE ENZYME AND DRUGS APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA). ACHEIS HAVE SLIGHTLY DIVERSE PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES, BUT ALL OF THEM WORK BY INHIBITING THE SEGREGATION OF ACH BY BLOCKING ACHE. WE REVIEWED SIGNIFICANT SCAFFOLDS INTRODUCED AS ACHEIS. IN SOME STUDIES, THE ACTIVITY AGAINST BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) HAS BEEN EVALUATED AS WELL BECAUSE BUCHE IS A SIMILAR ENZYME TO NEURONAL ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND IS CAPABLE OF HYDROLYZING ACH.

c("Lorena R. Braid", "Catherine A. Wood", "Barry N.

Despite substantial efforts, BChE has proven technically challenging to produce in recombinant systems. Recombinant BChE tends to be insufficiently or incorrectly glycosylated, and consequently exhibits a truncated half-life, compromised activity, or is immunogenic. Thus, expired human plasma remains the only reliable source of the benchmark BChE tetramer, but production is costly and time intensive and presents possible blood-borne disease hazards. Here we report a human BChE production platform that produces functionally active, tetrameric BChE enzyme, without the addition of external factors such as polyproline peptides or chemical or gene modification required by other systems. Human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs) are a rich population of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from Wharton's jelly. We show that HUCPVCs naturally and stably secrete BChE during culture in xeno- and serum-free media, and can be gene-modified to increase BChE output. However, BChE secretion from HUCPVCs is limited by innate feedback mechanisms that can be interrupted by addition of miR 186 oligonucleotide mimics or by competitive inhibition of muscarinic cholinergic signalling receptors by addition of atropine. By contrast, adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells neither secrete measurable levels of BChE naturally, nor after gene modification. Further work is required to fully characterize and disable the intrinsic ceiling of HUCPVC-mediated BChE secretion to achieve commercially relevant enzyme output. However, HUCPVCs present a unique opportunity to produce both native and strategically engineered recombinant BChE enzyme in a human platform with the innate capacity to secrete the benchmark human plasma form.

In this study leaf extracts were produced using ultrasound technology. Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease is a progressive mental deterioration related with ageing and senility, in which approved drugs for treatment inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), an enzyme present in the human brain. The ultrasound assisted extraction of natural anti-butyrylcholinesterase and antioxidants from this plant, and the yield of extraction were optimized using response surface methodology. The effect of acoustic power density (0.13‚Äì0.65 W/mL), time (1‚Äì20 min), and ethanol concentration (20‚Äì80%) on BChE inhibition, antioxidant activity, and extraction yield was determined, the optimum extraction conditions being 0.53 W/mL, 17.12 min and 74% ethanol. The optimized extracts were produced to experimentally validate the predicted responses. The IC50 concentrations were experimentally determined (26.2 Œºg/mL for BChE, 5.5 Œºg/mL for radical scavenging activity). A. serrata leaf extracts have potential to be used as complements to medicines traditionally used for memory dysfunction.

Compound 4a (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ6.5‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.1) was found to be most potent compared with the reference compound Galantamine (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ6.6‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.00038) and the other compounds (4b,4c,4d) were also possess that activity and hence can be employed for the discovery of lead compounds against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The depth analysis of the binding mechanism of these newly synthesized compounds inside the binding gorge of BChE, an in silico technique, molecular docking was performed. All the compounds were found to be well accommodated within the binding pocket of BChE. Compounds 4a, 4b and 4c showed hydrogen bonding interaction with binding site residue TYR332. Moreover, hydrophobic and œÄ‚ÄìœÄ interaction assisted the compounds to attain their enzyme inhibitory activity. These theoretical studies showed significant correlation with experimental results.

Thus, the aim of this study is to discover promising active compounds for Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase enzymes inhibitors based on QSAR model and drug-likeness evaluation. In this study, a series of DL0410 and its 50 derivatives are accounted for the set up of two QSAR models. This allows an exploration of the main molecular descriptors that control the inhibitory activity of specific compounds towards cholinesterase enzymes: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Simultanerously, the models can help to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds within its applicability domain. A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis is carried out to derive QSAR models. The results indicate that the QSAR models of Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity are robust and have a very good prediction capacity, testified by values of R2 equal to 0.935 and 0.895, respectively. The analysis carried out by adopting the QSAR models succeed in screening 15 potential compounds with higher biological activity. Subsequently, the investigated compounds has been subjected to the drug-likeness evaluation and reactivity study. The results show that most of the compounds do not present any bioavailability problem when administered orally. The results also allow determining the compounds that have not clearance problems, those that are the most stable and the most reactive among those tested. These findings indicate that the newly designed candidate drugs have promising potential toward AChE and BuChE enzyme inhibition and should be experimentally investigated.

A third dataset has been derived based on their selectivity and used for the development of partial least squares (PLS) based regression models. The developed models were extensively validated using various internal and external validation parameters. The features appearing in the model against AChE enzyme suggest that a small ring size, higher number of ‚àíCH2- groups, higher number of secondary aromatic amines and higher number of aromatic ketone groups may contribute to the inhibitory activity. The features obtained from the model against BuChE enzyme suggest that the sum of topological distances between two nitrogen atoms, higher number of fragments X-C(=X)-X, higher number of secondary aromatic amides, fragment R--CR-X may be more favorable for inhibition. The features obtained from selectivity based model suggest that the number of aromatic ethers, unsaturation content relative to the molecular size and molecular shape may be more specific for the inhibition of the AChE enzyme in comparison to the BuChE enzyme. Moreover, we have implemented the molecular docking studies using the most and least active molecules from the datasets in order to identify the binding pattern between ligand and target enzyme. The obtained information is then correlated with the essential structural features associated with the 2D-QSAR models.

AChE exists as different globular molecular forms: tetramer (G4), dimer (G2) and monomer (G1). In adult brain, G4 form is abundant however in AD, the ratio of lower molecular forms (G1) to G4 form increased. Hence, the present study delineated the inhibition of novel astaxanthin-s-allyl cysteine (AST-SAC) against BChE and various molecular forms of AChE. Cobra venom, human erythrocyte and Electrophorus electricus was used as source of G1, G2 and G4 form of AChE. AST-SAC showed inhibition against G1 (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.72‚ÄØŒºM, competitive, Ki‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.66‚ÄØŒºM), G2 (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.65‚ÄØŒºM, mixed, Ki‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.50‚ÄØŒºM) and G4 (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.67‚ÄØŒºM, competitive, Ki‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.67‚ÄØŒºM) form of AChE. AST-SAC inhibited human brain AChE (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.84‚ÄØŒºM, competitive, Ki‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.53‚ÄØŒºM) and human serum BChE (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.80‚ÄØŒºM, competitive, Ki‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.58‚ÄØŒºM). In silico analysis revealed the interaction of AST-SAC with the amino acids present in peripheral anionic and catalytic site of human AChE and BChE.

CPF IRREVERSIBLY INHIBITS ACETYLCHOLINESTERASES (ACHE), WHILE PYRETHROIDS ARE NOT ACHE INHIBITORS. HOWEVER, COMBINATIONS OF PYRETHROIDS WITH OPS SHOWED A HIGHLY SYNERGISTIC EFFECT ON ACHE INHIBITION. THUS, THE AIM OF THE CURRENT WORK WAS TO EVALUATE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO THE INHIBITORY POTENCY OF BOTH PESTICIDES, ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH ACHE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITIES IN SHEEP BLOOD. IN VITRO, IC50 VALUES WERE SIMILAR AFTER CPF OR CPF PLUS CPM INCUBATIONS. THE POUR-ON COADMINISTRATION OF RECOMMENDED DOSES OF CPF AND CPM DID NOT CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT INHIBITION OF ACHE AND BCHE IN SHEEP BLOOD. ONLY SLIGHT PERCENTAGES OF INHIBITION OF THEIR CATALYTIC ACTIVITIES WERE OBSERVED WHEN BOTH DRUGS WERE GIVEN AT 4-FOLD HIGHER DOSE RATES. THE LOWER SYSTEMIC AVAILABILITY OF TOPICAL ADMINISTRATION OF OPS IN SHEEP MAY HELP TO EXPLAIN THE LOWER DEGREE OF INHIBITION OF BLOOD ACHE AND BCHE IN VIVO. THE RESULTS EMERGED FROM THIS RESEARCH ARE A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE RISKS OF IMPLEMENTING HIGHER DOSAGE REGIMENS OF OPS-CONTAINING ANTIPARASITIC FORMULATIONS.

c("Mohamed K. {Abd El-Rahman}", "Sherif M. Eid", "Mohamed R. Elghobashy", "Khadiga M. Kelani") Inline potentiometric monitoring of Butyrylcholinesterase activity based on metabolism of bambuterol at the point of care Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical 0925-4005 285 216-223 2019 10.1016/j.snb.2019.01.055 Globally, millions of patients are being exposed to anesthetics during surgeries. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is the main metabolizing enzyme for these anesthetics. BChE silent activity defect, either acquired or genetic, may be life threatening due to apnea and respiratory paralysis. Hence, the development of point-of-care analytical methods for screening of BChE activity is of great importance to identify patients with BChE defect. This study describes the development of an ionophore-doped screen-printed ion selective electrode as a fast and simple method to efficiently achieve a continuous monitoring of the enzymatic hydrolysis of bambuterol (BAM) as substrate. BChE activity parameters (Vmax and Km) were calculated to be 1.7‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí8 mol min-1‚Äâml-1 and 7.9‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-5 mol l-1, respectively, indicating high affinity of BChE towards BAM. A side by side comparison of the results obtained using the inline potentiometric approach and a recently published online ATR-FTIR method is presented to highlight the opportunities and challenges of each method. For clinical diagnostics, this approach provides a new platform for rapid determination of enzyme kinetics in real time and clearly identify patients that are susceptible to potentially lethal respiratory paralysis.

J ALZHEIMERS DIS 1875-8908 75 417-427 2020 10.3233/JAD-191335 AN EPISTATIC INTERACTION BETWEEN THE …õ4 ALLELE OF APOLIPOPROTEIN E (APOE…õ4) GENE AND THE K-VARIANT OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE-K) GENES HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO INCREASE RISK OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD). HOWEVER, THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE LARGELY FROM CASE-CONTROL STUDIES WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES. TO EXAMINE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN APOE…õ4 AND BCHE-K ON: 1) THE RISK OF INCIDENT AD AND 2) RATES OF CHANGE IN BRAIN VOLUMES AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE DURING THE PRECLINICAL STAGES OF AD IN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. THE STUDY SAMPLE FOR SURVIVAL ANALYSIS INCLUDED 691 CAUCASIAN PARTICIPANTS (AGE AT BASELINE, 58.4¬±9.9 YEARS; FOLLOW-UP TIME,16.9¬±9.7 YEARS) FROM THE BALTIMORE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF AGING. THE NEUROIMAGING SAMPLE INCLUDED 302 PARTICIPANTS WITH 1,388 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) SCANS. COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE WAS ASSESSED IN 703 PARTICIPANTS OVER 4,908 VISITS. A TOTAL OF 122 DIAGNOSES (79 AD, 43 MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT [MCI]) WERE IDENTIFIED. PARTICIPANTS WITH BOTH APOE…õ4 AND BCHE-K VARIANTS HAD A 3.7-FOLD GREATER RISK OF AD (HAZARD RATIO [HR] 95% CI=1.99-6.89, P¬Ää<¬Ää0.001) COMPARED TO NON-CARRIERS OF BOTH GENES (APOE …õ4 X BCHE-K INTERACTION P¬Ää=¬Ää0.025). THERE WAS NO APOE …õ4-BCHE-K INTERACTION EFFECT ON RATE OF COGNITIVE DECLINE AND BRAIN ATROPHY. THE APOE AND BCHE GENES INTERACT TO INFLUENCE RISK OF INCIDENT AD/MCI BUT NOT RATES OF BRAIN ATROPHY AND DECLINE IN COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE BEFORE ONSET OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. THIS MAY SUGGEST THE EPISTATIC INTERACTION BETWEEN APOE …õ4 AND BCHE-K ON AD RISK IS DISEASE STAGE-DEPENDENT.

Herein, synthesis and AChE/BChE inhibition activity of some twenty derivatives of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroazepino[4,3-b]indole (HHAI) is reported. Most of the newly synthesized HHAI derivatives achieved the inhibition of both ChE isoforms with IC50s in the micromolar range, with a structure-dependent selectivity toward BChE. Apparently, molecular volume and lipophilicity do increase selectivity toward BChE, and indeed the N2-(4-phenylbutyl) HHAI derivative 15d, which behaves as a mixed-type inhibitor, resulted the most potent (IC50 0.17‚ÄØŒºM) and selective (>100-fold) inhibitor toward either horse serum and human BChE. Moreover, 15d inhibited in¬ vitro self-induced aggregation of neurotoxic amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) peptide and displayed neuroprotective effects in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, significantly recovering (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001) cell viability when impaired by AŒ≤1-42 and hydrogen peroxide insults. Overall, this study highlighted HHAI as useful and versatile scaffold for developing new small molecules targeting some enzymes and biochemical pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

The carbamates and salicylanilides exhibited mostly a moderate inhibition of both cholinesterase enzymes with IC50 values ranging from 5 to 235‚ÄØ¬µM. IC50 values for AChE were in a narrower concentration range when compared to BChE, but many of the compounds produced a balanced inhibition of both cholinesterases. The derivatives were comparable or superior to rivastigmine for AChE inhibition, but only a few of carbamates also for BChE. Several structure-activity relationships were identified, e.g., N-phenethylcarbamates produce clearly favourable BChE inhibition. The compounds also share convenient physicochemical properties for CNS penetration.

BMC COMPLEMENT ALTERN MED 1472-6882 19 296 2018 10.1186/s12906-019-2679-1 BERGENIA CILIATA IS A MEDICINAL PLANT USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIARRHEA, VOMITING, FEVER, COUGH, DIABETES, CANCER, PULMONARY DISORDERS AND WOUND HEALING. IN THIS STUDY, BERGENIA CILIATA CRUDE EXTRACT, SUBFRACTIONS, AND ISOLATED COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED FOR THEIR ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTICHOLINESTERASE POTENTIAL. THE FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING CAPACITIES OF THE EXTRACTS DETERMINED USING DPPH AND ABTS ASSAYS. THE ANTICHOLINESTERASE POTENTIALS WERE DETERMINED USING ACETYLCHOLINE ESTERASE AND BUTYRYL CHOLINE ESTERASE ENZYMES. TO DETERMINE THE PHYTOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION, THE EXTRACTS WERE SUBJECTED TO HPLC ANALYSIS AND SILICA GEL COLUMN ISOLATION. BASED ON HPLC FINGERPRINTING RESULTS, THE ETHYL ACETATE FRACTION WAS FOUND TO HAVE MORE BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND WAS THEREFORE SUBJECTED TO SILICA GEL COLUMN ISOLATION. AS A RESULT, THREE COMPOUNDS; PYROGALLOL, RUTIN, AND MORIN WERE ISOLATED IN THE PURE STATE. THE STRUCTURES OF THE ISOLATED COMPOUNDS WERE ELUCIDATED USING SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES LIKE  H-NMR, IR AND UV-VISIBLE. THE CRUDE EXTRACT SHOWED MAXIMUM ANTICHOLINESTERASE (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE¬Äâ=¬Äâ90.22¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ1.15% AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE¬Äâ=¬Äâ88.22¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ0.71%) AND FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING (87.37¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ2.45 AND 83.50¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ0.70% RESPECTIVELY AGAINST DPPH AND ABTS RADICALS) POTENTIALS. THE TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENTS (EXPRESSED AS EQUIVALENT OF GALLIC ACID; MGGAE/G) WERE HIGHER IN ETHYL ACETATE FRACTION (80.96¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ1.74) FOLLOWED BY CRUDE EXTRACT (70.65¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ0.86) WHILE THE FLAVONOID CONTENTS (EXPRESSED AS QUERCETIN EQUIVALENT; MGQE/G) AND WERE HIGHER IN CRUDE EXTRACT (88.40¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ1.12) FOLLOWED BY N-BUTANOL FRACTION (60.10¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ1.86). THE ISOLATED BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS PYROGALLOL, RUTIN, AND MORIN WERE FOUND ACTIVE AGAINST ABTS AND DPPH FREE RADICALS. AMONGST THEM, PYROGALLOL WAS MORE ACTIVE AGAINST BOTH FREE RADICALS. REASONABLE ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES WERE RECORDED FOR PYROGALLOL AGAINST SELECTED ENZYMES. THE EXTRACTS AND ISOLATED COMPOUNDS SHOWED ANTIOXIDANT AND ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY POTENTIALS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THIS PLANT COULD BE HELPFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS IF USED IN THE FORM OF EXTRACTS.

TWO NEW GALACTOMANNANS (GALACTOMANNAN I AND II) WERE ISOLATED FROM R. LUTEOLUS AND G. ADSPERSUM. THEIR STRUCTURES WERE CHARACTERIZED USING FT-IR, 1D, AND 2D-NMR TECHNIQUES. BOTH ISOLATED GALACTOMANNANS I AND II MAINLY INCLUDE D-MANNOSE AND D-GALACTOSE IN THE MOLAR PERCENTAGES OF 0.81:1.0 AND 1:1.4, RESPECTIVELY. THE GPC CALCULATION DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MOLECULAR WEIGHTS ARE ABOUT 5240 AND 5090¬ÄØDA, RESPECTIVELY. THEIR STRUCTURES COMPRISE OF Œ≤-(1,4)-MANNOSE (MAN) BACKBONE UNITS WITH Œ±-(1,6)-GALACTOSE (GAL) SINGLE UNIT AS A SIDE GROUP. THE ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY OF GALACTOMANNANS WAS TESTED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY. ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WAS ALSO MEASURED BY SIX ASSAYS (ABTS , DPPH , O , Œ≤-CAROTENE-LINOLEIC ACID, METAL CHELATING, AND CUPRAC ASSAYS). GALACTOMANNAN II INDICATED CLOSE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY TO GALANTAMINE AGAINST ACHE (61.04¬ÄØ¬±¬ÄØ0.45%) AND BCHE (59.70¬ÄØ¬±¬ÄØ1.15%) AT 50¬ÄØŒºG/ML CONCENTRATION. NEVERTHELESS, BOTH GALACTOMANNANS SHOWED LOW ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY IN ALL TESTS. THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT MAINLY, GALACTOMANNAN II COULD BE USED AS A NEW NATURAL PROMISING ANTICHOLINESTERASE AGENT.

THE POTENTIAL OF KOLAVIRON, A BIFLAVONOID FROM GARCINIA KOLA TO STIMULATE GLUCOSE UPTAKE AND SUPPRESS GLUCOSE-INDUCED OXIDATIVE TOXICITY WERE INVESTIGATED IN RAT BRAIN. ITS MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS WITH THE TARGET PROTEINS WERE INVESTIGATED IN SILICO. KOLAVIRON WAS INCUBATED WITH EXCISED RAT BRAIN IN THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE FOR 2 H, WITH METFORMIN SERVING AS A POSITIVE CONTROL. KOLAVIRON CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) INCREASE IN GLUCOSE UPTAKE, GLUTATHIONE LEVEL, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, CATALASE, ATPASE, ENTPDASE AND 5'-NUCLEOTIDASE ACTIVITIES, WHILE CONCOMITANTLY DEPLETING MALONDIALDEHYDE LEVEL, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO BRAINS INCUBATED WITH GLUCOSE ONLY. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM AND TEM) ANALYSIS REVEALED KOLAVIRON HAD LITTLE OR NO EFFECT ON THE ULTRASTRUCTURAL MORPHOLOGY OF BRAIN TISSUES AS EVIDENCED BY THE INTACT DENDRITIC AND NEURONAL NETWORK, BLOOD VESSELS, MITOCHONDRIA, SYNAPTIC VESICLES, AND PRE-SYNAPTIC MEMBRANE. SEM-EDX ANALYSIS REVEALED A RESTORATIVE EFFECT OF GLUCOSE-INDUCED ALTERATION IN BRAIN ELEMENTAL CONCENTRATIONS, WITH TOTAL DEPLETION OF ALUMINUM AND ZINC. MTT ANALYSIS REVEALED KOLAVIRON HAD NO CYTOTOXIC EFFECT ON HT-22 CELLS. MOLECULAR DOCKING REVEALED A POTENT INTERACTION BETWEEN KOLAVIRON AND CATALASE AT THE SER114 AND MET350 RESIDUES, WITH A BINDING ENERGY OF 12 KCAL/MOL. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS PORTRAY THE POTENTIAL OF KOLAVIRON TO STIMULATE GLUCOSE UPTAKE WHILE CONCOMITANTLY COFFERING A NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT.

THE PFT TESTS ON THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY REVEALED BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION THAT WAS CONFIRMED AND EXPLAINED WITH MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES. THE PRONOUNCED REDUCTION OF OPTICAL DENSITY AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY WAS FOUND AS A RESULT OF IRRADIATION OF THE PFT WATER SOLUTION WITH LASER BEAM AT WAVELENGTH 266¬†NM. THE OBSERVED PHENOMENON WAS EXPLAINED ON THE BASE OF MOLECULAR DYNAMICS, DOCKING, AND DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY MODELING BY THE FORMATION OF PFT CONFORMERS VIA LASER-INDUCED PHOSPHONATE GROUP TWISTING. THE REORGANIZATION OF THE PFT GEOMETRY WAS FOUND TO BE A REASON OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION MECHANISM CHANGE AND THE SITE-SPECIFICITY LOSS. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PFT COMBINES PHOTOSWITCHING AND BIOACTIVE PROPERTIES IN ONE MOLECULE THAT MAKES IT PROMISING AS A MOLECULAR BASIS FOR THE FURTHER DESIGN OF BIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES WITH PHOTOSENSITIVE PROPERTIES BASED ON THE MECHANISM OF THE PHOSPHONATE GROUP PHOTOTWISTING.

INHIBITORY EFFECT EXTRACTS FROM LEPIDIUM SATIVUM, JUNIPERUS PHOENICEA AND JUNIPERUS OXYCEDRUS ON ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE USING ELLMAN METHOD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED USING DONEPEZIL AS POSITIVE CONTROL. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDY CARRIED OUT USING AUTODOCK VINA. THE STRUCTURES OF STUDIED MOLECULES LEPIDINE B, GALANTAMINE AND DONEPEZIL WERE OBTAINED FROM PUBCHEM DATABASE AND PROTEIN DATABANK. ALKALOIDAL EXTRACT OF LEPIDIUM SATIVUM AND ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACTS OF JUNIPERUS PHOENICEA AND JUNIPERUS OXYCEDRUS EXHIBIT A STRONG ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY WITH IC50 VALUES OF 0.59 ¬± 0.04, 0.57 ¬± 0.00 AND 0.49 ¬± 0.00 MG/ML, RESPECTIVELY USING DONEPEZIL <0.25 MG/ML AS POSITIVE CONTROL. THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF ALKALOID OF L. SATIVUM, LEPIDINE B BIND SO TIGHTLY TO ACHE AND BUCHE AS MUCH AS GALANTAMINE AND DONEPEZIL. WE SUGGEST THAT LEPIDINE B IS A NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITORY BY INTERACTING WITH PAS OF ACHE AND BUCHE, THEREFORE IT IS CAPABLE TO PREVENT THE HUACHE-INDUCED AŒ≤ AGGREGATION. WE HAVE FOUND SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS IN THE LEPIDINE B-BACE AND LEPIDINE B-MAGL COMPLEXES. THE DOCKING STUDY INDICATE THAT LEPIDINE B IS A PROMISING ANTI-AD DRUG AND MIGHT BECOME A DRUG CANDIDATE TO PREVENT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DUE TO ITS MULTIPLE ROLES AS POTENT INHIBITOR FOR ACHE, BUCHE, BACE AND MAGL, ALSO INHIBITOR FOR AŒ≤ FIBRILLOGENESIS.

HOWEVER, A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP HAS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED, LEADING SOME TO DOUBT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OCCUPATIONAL OP EXPOSURE AND BEHAVIORAL DEFICITS. PESTICIDE APPLICATION TEAMS IN EGYPT WHO ARE PRIMARILY EXPOSED TO ONE OP, CHLORPYRIFOS (CPF), WERE RECRUITED INTO A FIELD ASSESSMENT. TRAIL MAKING A AND THE MORE CHALLENGING TRAIL MAKING B TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO 54 ENGINEERS (WHO SUPERVISE THE PESTICIDE APPLICATION PROCESS, USUALLY FROM THE SIDE OF THE FIELD), 59 TECHNICIANS (WHO GUIDE THE PESTICIDE APPLICATORS IN THE FIELD), 31 APPLICATORS (WHO MIX AND APPLY PESTICIDES USING KNAPSACK SPRAYERS), AND 150 CONTROLS (WHO DID NOT WORK IN THE FIELDS) AT TWO DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE OP APPLICATION SEASON AS WELL AS IMMEDIATELY AFTER APPLICATIONS HAD ENDED AND 1.5 MONTHS LATER. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE MALES SINCE ONLY MALES WORK ON PESTICIDE APPLICATION TEAMS IN EGYPT. URINARY LEVELS OF 3,5,6-TRICHLORO-2-PYRIDINOL (TCPY), A SPECIFIC METABOLITE OF CPF, CONFIRMED THE PATTERN OF LOWER TO HIGHER CPF EXPOSURES FROM ENGINEERS TO TECHNICIANS TO APPLICATORS, AND THESE WERE ALL GREATER THAN URINARY METABOLITE LEVELS IN CONTROLS. A CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JOB TITLE AND PERFORMANCE SPEED ON THE BEHAVIORAL TASK WAS OBSERVED: CONTROLS HAD THE BEST (FASTEST) PERFORMANCE ON TRAIL MAKING A AND B TESTS THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION SEASON, AND APPLICATORS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER PERFORMANCE THAN ENGINEERS ON TRAIL MAKING A (P¬ÄØ=¬ÄØ0.015) AND B (P¬ÄØ=¬ÄØ0.003). HOWEVER, INDIVIDUAL URINARY TCPY, BLOOD ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) LEVELS DID NOT PREDICT INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES A DOSE-RELATED EFFECT BASED ON JOB TITLE, WHICH SERVES AS A SURROGATE FOR CHRONIC EXPOSURE IN THAT DIFFERING JOB TITLES EXHIBIT VARYING GROUP EXPOSURE LEVELS. THE RESULTS ESTABLISH THAT CHRONIC OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO CHLORPYRIFOS IS NEUROTOXIC AND SUGGEST THAT THE CLASSIC BIOMARKERS OF RECENT CPF EXPOSURE ARE NOT PREDICTIVE OF CHRONIC EXPOSURE EFFECTS.

THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW IS TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT THERAPIES BASED ON THE "COMBINATION-DRUGS-MULTITARGETS" STRATEGY TO TARGET MULTIPLE PATHOLOGIES TO BLOCK THE PROGRESSION OF PATHOGENESIS OF AD. IN ADDITION TO CHOLINERGIC AND AMYLOID TARGETS, A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT IS FOCUSED ON TARGETING THE METAL-INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS COMPONENT OF THE DISEASE. THE MAIN FOCUS OF RESEARCH IS BASED ON MODIFICATIONS OF EXISTING DRUGS WITH SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. TACRINE WAS THE FIRST ACHE INHIBITOR TO BE INTRODUCED INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE AND HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USED FOR THE DESIGN OF MULTITARGET-DIRECTED LIGANDS. A NUMBER OF HYBRID COMPOUNDS CONTAINING TACRINE AND STRUCTURAL MOIETIES DERIVED FROM NATURAL SOURCES SUCH AS FLAVONOIDS [QUERCETIN, RUTIN, COUMARIN, GALLAMINE, RESVERATROL, SCUTELLARIN, ANISIDINE, HESPERETIN, (-)-EPICATECHIN] AND OTHER MOLECULES (MELATONIN, TROLOX) HAVE ALSO BEEN APPLIED TO FUNCTION AS MULTITARGET-DIRECTED LIGANDS. MOST OF THESE HYBRIDS ARE POTENT INHIBITORS OF ACHE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND ALSO OF AMYLOID-BETA AGGREGATION. IN ADDITION, THE ANTIOXIDANT FUNCTIONALITY, REPRESENTED BY COUMARINS, MELATONIN AND OTHER ANTIOXIDANT MOLECULES REDUCES THE LEVEL OF OXIDATIVE STRESS VIA ROS-SCAVENGING MECHANISMS, AS WELL AS VIA CHELATION OF REDOX-ACTIVE CU AND FE, THUS SUPPRESSING THE FORMATION OF ROS VIA THE FENTON REACTION. VARIOUS MEDICINAL PLANTS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THEIR ABILITY TO AMELIORATE SYMPTOMS OF AD. THE THERAPEUTIC POTENCY OF HUPERZINE A AND B, GINSENG, CURCUMIN AND OTHER COMPOUNDS IS MANIFESTED PREDOMINANTLY BY THE INHIBITORY ACTION TOWARD ACHE, ANTIOXIDANT OR RADICAL-SCAVENGING AND REDOX METAL-CHELATING ACTIVITY, INHIBITION OF AMYLOID-BETA AGGREGATION AND TAU-PROTEIN HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION AND ANTIINFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY. FLAVONOIDS NOT ONLY FUNCTION AS ANTIOXIDANTS AND METAL-CHELATING AGENTS, BUT ALSO INTERACT WITH PROTEIN KINASE AND LIPID KINASE SIGNALING PATHWAYS, AND OTHERS INVOLVING MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, NF-KAPPAB AND TYROSINE KINASE. AMONG THE MOST PROMISING GROUP OF SUBSTANCES WITH POTENTIAL ACTIVITY AGAINST AD ARE THE FLAVONOIDS, INCLUDING MYRICETIN, MORIN, RUTIN, QUERCETIN, FISETIN, KAEMPFEROL, APIGENIN AND GLYCITEIN, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN, IN VITRO, TO POSSESS ANTIAMYLOIDOGENIC AND FIBRIL-DESTABILIZATION ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO ACT AS METAL CHELATORS AND TO SUPPRESSING OXIDATIVE STRESS. IN TERMS OF THE CLINICAL USE OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL HYBRIDS, HERBAL DRUGS OR FLAVONOIDS AGAINST AD, SOME REMAINING CHALLENGES ARE TO ESTABLISH THE IDEAL DOSE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE FORMULATIONS TO PRESERVE BIOAVAILABILITY AND TO DETERMINE THE STAGE WHEN THEY SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED. IF THE ONSET OF THE DISEASE COULD BE DELAYED BY A DECADE, THE NUMBER OF AD VICTIMS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED.

Mass spectrometric detection of modified FGESAGAAS peptide at the active site is a powerful exposure biomarker tool. The aim of this study was to develop mass spectrometry-based method for BChE adduct formation screening, avoiding the use of standard peptides. Immunomagnetic separation of proteins from plasma was optimized. Commercially available anti-butyrylcholinesterase monoclonal antibodies, immobilized on magnetic beads, resulted in stable and reusable affinity sorbent. The method was tested on horse serum BChE and real human plasma from healthy donors, treated with Russian VX (VR). The BChE isolated from blood plasma was digested with pepsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method was evaluated by using synthetic peptides and by comparison to the enzymatic activity Ellman's assay. The minimum concentration of VR exposure, resulting in detectable VR-adduct, was 0.2‚ÄØng/mL, which corresponded to the relative BChE inhibition of less than 2%. Adduct formation assessment was performed via monitoring of decrease in non-modified peptide LC-MS/MS signal and increase in VR-modified peptide signal. The designed approach was tested in a pilot study with 5 blood samples from healthy volunteers. Mass spectrometry-based method for BChE adduct formation was found to be in agreement with Ellman's inhibition assay, so the method is applicable for direct BChE inhibition assessment.

BMC COMPLEMENT MED THER 2662-7671 20 313 2020 10.1186/s12906-020-03093-1 ETHNOBOTANICAL AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTS ALLOW FOR THE ISOLATION OF ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS AGAINST A NUMBER OF MALADIES. MONOTHECA BUXIFOLIA IS USED BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES DUE TO ITS DIGESTIVE AND LAXATIVE PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO CURE LIVER, KIDNEY, AND URINARY DISEASES. THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLORE THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES AND CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF THIS MEDICINAL PLANT. IN THIS WORK, THE BIOCHEMICAL POTENTIAL OF M. BUXIFOLIA (FALC.) A. DC WAS EXPLORED AND LINKED WITH ITS BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. METHANOL AND CHLOROFORM EXTRACTS FROM LEAVES AND STEMS WERE INVESTIGATED FOR TOTAL PHENOLIC AND FLAVONOID CONTENTS. ULTRAHIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED WITH MASS SPECTROMETRY (UHPLC-MS) WAS USED TO DETERMINE SECONDARY-METABOLITE COMPOSITION, WHILE HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED WITH PHOTODIODE ARRAY DETECTION (HPLC-PDA) WAS USED FOR POLYPHENOLIC QUANTIFICATION. IN ADDITION, WE CARRIED OUT IN VITRO ASSAYS TO DETERMINE ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL AND THE ENZYME-INHIBITORY RESPONSE OF M. BUXIFOLIA EXTRACTS. PHENOLICS (91¬ÄâMG GALLIC-ACID EQUIVALENT (GAE)/G) AND FLAVONOIDS (48.86¬ÄâMG QUERCETIN EQUIVALENT (QE)/G) EXHIBITED THEIR HIGHEST CONCENTRATION IN THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF STEMS AND THE CHLOROFORM EXTRACT OF LEAVES, RESPECTIVELY. UHPLC-MS ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PHYTOCHEMICALS, BELONGING TO THE FLAVONOID, PHENOLIC, ALKALOID, AND TERPENOID CLASSES OF SECONDARY METABOLITES. THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF LEAVES CONTAINED A DIOSGENIN DERIVATIVE AND POLYGALACIN D, WHILE KAEMPFEROL AND ROBININ WERE MOST ABUNDANT IN THE CHLOROFORM EXTRACT. THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF STEMS CONTAINED A GREATER PEAK AREA FOR DIOSGENIN AND KAEMPFEROL, WHEREAS THIS WAS TRUE FOR LUCIDUMOL A AND 3-O-CIS-COUMAROYL MASLINIC ACID IN THE CHLOROFORM EXTRACT. RUTIN, EPICATECHIN, AND CATECHIN WERE THE MAIN PHENOLICS IDENTIFIED BY HPLC-PDA ANALYSIS. THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF STEMS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT 2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL (DPPH) AND 2,2'-AZINO-BIS(3-ETHYLBENZOTHIAZOLINE-6-SULFONIC ACID (ABTS) RADICAL-SCAVENGING ACTIVITIES (145.18 AND 279.04¬ÄâMMOL TROLOX EQUIVALENT (TE)/G, RESPECTIVELY). THE MAXIMUM CUPRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (CUPRAC) (361.4¬ÄâMG TE/G), FERRIC-REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER (FRAP) (247.19¬ÄâMG TE/G), AND TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL (2.75¬ÄâMMOL TE/G) WERE DEPICTED BY THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF STEMS. THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF LEAVES EXHIBITED STRONGER INHIBITION AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND GLUCOSIDASE, WHILE THE CHLOROFORM EXTRACT OF STEMS WAS MOST ACTIVE AGAINST BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) (4.27¬ÄâMG GALANTAMINE EQUIVALENT (GALAE)/G). SIMILARLY, THE HIGHEST TYROSINASE (140¬ÄâMG KOJIC-ACID EQUIVALENT (KAE)/G) AND AMYLASE (0.67¬ÄâMMOL ACARBOSE EQUIVALENT (ACAE)/G) INHIBITION WAS OBSERVED FOR THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF STEMS. UHPLC-MS ANALYSIS AND HPLC-PDA QUANTIFICATION IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF BIOACTIVE SECONDARY METABOLITES OF M. BUXIFOLIA, WHICH MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL AND ENZYME-INHIBITORY RESPONSE. M. BUXIFOLIA CAN BE FURTHER EXPLORED FOR THE ISOLATION OF ITS ACTIVE COMPONENTS TO BE USED AS A DRUG.

CHEM BIODIVERS 1612-1880 16 E1900333 2019 10.1002/cbdv.201900333 IN THE CURRENT STUDY, THE ETHANOL EXTRACTS OF FLOWER, STEM, AND ROOT PARTS OF TWO ENDEMIC TURKISH SPECIES, E.¬ÄâG., HAPLOPHYLLUM SAHINII O. TUGAY & D. ULUKU≈ü AND H. VULCANICUM BOISS. & HELDR., WERE SCREENED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ASSOCIATED WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AS WELL AS TYROSINASE (TYR) LINKED TO PARKINSON'S DISEASE USING ELISA MICROPLATE ASSAY AT 200¬ÄÖŒºG/ML. AMONG THE EXTRACTS, THE HIGHEST INHIBITION WAS CAUSED BY THE STEM EXTRACT OF H. SAHINII AGAINST BCHE (IC  =64.93¬±1.38¬ÄÖŒºG/ML). CONSISTENTLY, ALL OF THE EXTRACTS WERE FOUND TO EXERT A SELECTIVE INHIBITION TOWARDS BCHE TO SOME EXTENT. IT WAS ONLY THE ROOT EXTRACT OF H. VULCANICUM THAT COULD INHIBIT ACHE AT LOW LEVEL (IC  =203.18¬±5.33¬ÄÖŒºG/ML). NONE OF THE EXTRACTS DISPLAYED AN INHIBITION OVER 50¬Äâ% AGAINST TYR. METABOLITE PROFILING OF THE EXTRACTS WAS ACHIEVED BY A HIGHLY HYPHENATED LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHIC MASS SPECTROMETRIC TECHNIQUE (HPLC-DAD-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS), WHICH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF FUROQUINOLINE (Œ≤-FAGARINE, Œ≥-FAGARINE) AND AMIDE (TUBASENICINE, TUBACETINE) ALKALOIDS; FURANO- (RUTAMARIN), PYRANO- (XANTHYLETINE), AND GERANYLOXY COUMARINS; PHENYLPROPANOID (SECOISOLARICIRESINOL), ARYLNAPHTHALENE (MONO-O-ACETYLDIPHYLLIN APIOSIDE), AND DIBENZYLBUTYROLACTONE (KUSUNOKININ, HAPLOMYRFOLIN) LIGNANS. SEVERAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE EXTRACTS ANALYZED. Œ≤-FAGARINE WAS THE MAJOR ALKALOID IN H. VULCANICUM, WHEREAS Œ≥-FAGARINE WAS PRESENT ONLY IN THE ROOTS OF BOTH HAPLOPHYLLUM SPECIES; MOREOVER, SECOISOLARICIRESINOL AND SECOISOLARICIRESINOL DIMETHYL ETHER WERE THE MAIN LIGNANS IN THE STEMS AND FLOWERS. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY IDENTIFYING CHE AND TYR INHIBITORY EFFECT AND METABOLIC PROFILES OF H. VULCANICUM AND H. SAHINII.

PHYTOCHEMISTRY 1873-3700 168 112128 2019 10.1016/j.phytochem.2019.112128 THE ISOLATION OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS FROM NATURAL SOURCES IS A KEY STEP IN DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT, HOWEVER, THIS PROCEDURE IS USUALLY EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY AND THE LIMITED AMOUNTS OF THE METABOLITES IN THE EXTRACTS. THUS, RATIONAL OR TARGETING ISOLATIONS ARE BECOMING MORE POPULAR TO REDUCE THE BOTTLENECKS IN BIOACTIVE NATURAL PRODUCTS RESEARCH. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED A LC-MS-BASED METABOLOMIC APPROACH AND BIOCHEMOMETRIC STATISTICAL TOOLS (PCA AND OPLS-DA) TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ALKALOIDS PREDICTORS IN ZANTHOXYLUM GENUS (RUTACEAE). FOR THIS PURPOSE, 41 ALKALOID EXTRACTS FROM NINE COLOMBIAN ZANTHOXYLUM SPECIES WERE SCREENED BY UHPLC-UV-HRMS AND INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). BASED ON THE SCREENING RESULTS, A MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS (MVA) AND SELECTION OF ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE CANDIDATES WERE PERFORMED USING THE S-PLOT FROM THE OPLS-DA MODEL. THE SUPERVISED ANALYSIS (OPLS-DA) PARING THE ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE SCREENING AND LC-HRMS DATA SHOWED AT LEAST 11 CHE INHIBITION MARKERS WHICH COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED IN THE DIFFERENTIATION OF ACTIVE AND INACTIVE EXTRACTS. THE PREDICTORS WERE TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED BY COMPARING CHROMATOGRAPHIC RETENTION TIMES (R ) AND ACCURATE MASS AND MS  FRAGMENTATION PATTERNS. IN GENERAL, THE INHIBITION MARKERS CORRESPOND TO FOUR TYPES OF ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS: TETRAHYDROPROTOBERBERINES, PROTOBERBERINES, DIHYDROBENZOPHENANTHRIDINES AND BENZOPHENANTHRIDINES. THE MOST ACTIVE EXTRACTS FROM Z. SCHREBERI AND Z. MONOPHYLUM SHOWED THE HIGHEST PRESENCE OF BERBERINE AND CHELERYTHRINE, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. THUS, TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS OF THE OPLS-DA MODEL, THREE ALKALOIDS FROM THE BARK OF Z. SCHREBERI (IDENTIFIED AS BERBERINE, CHELERYTHRINE AND COLUMBAMINE) WERE BIO-DIRECTED ISOLATED, AND ALL OF THEM SHOWED STRONG INHIBITION AGAINST BOTH ENZYMES. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT OUR STATISTICAL MODELS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE RATIONAL SEARCH OF ANTICHOLINESTERASE ALKALOIDS. THEREFORE, LC-MS-BASED METABOLOMIC APPROACH COMBINED WITH CHEMOMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ARE SHOWN AS USEFUL TOOLS FOR THE ISOLATION OF TARGETED BIOACTIVE NATURAL PRODUCTS, CONTRIBUTING TO IMPROVE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF LEAD COMPOUNDS.

THIS STUDY AIMED AT COMPARING THE EFFECT OF METFORMIN AND METFORMIN/DONEPEZIL COMBINATION ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM STRESS AND INFLAMMATION IN THE BRAIN OF DIABETIC WISTAR RATS. DIABETES WAS INDUCED BY SINGLE INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION OF 40 MG/KG STREPTOZOTOCIN AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF 10% FRUCTOSE FOR 14 DAYS. ANIMALS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO FOUR GROUPS OF FIVE ANIMALS EACH. GROUP 1 WAS THE NORMAL CONTROL AND RECEIVED ONLY DISTILLED WATER. GROUPS 2 AND 3 WERE DIABETIC RATS TREATED WITH METFORMIN/DONEPEZIL COMBINATION AND METFORMIN ONLY RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GROUP 4 WAS DIABETIC CONTROL. TREATMENT LASTED FOR 21 DAYS AFTER CONFIRMATION OF DIABETES. ACTIVITIES OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD), GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE (GPX) AND CATALASE WERE EVALUATED IN THE BRAIN OF DIABETIC RATS. ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY WAS USED TO ESTIMATE BRAIN LEVELS OF TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6) MALONDIALDEHYDE AND GLUCOSE TRANSPORTER-4 (GLUT4), WHILE EXPRESSION OF ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM STRESS MARKERS - GLUCOSE REGULATED PROTEIN-78 (GRP78), ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-4 (ATF4) AND C/EBP HOMOLOGOUS PROTEIN (CHOP) WAS DETERMINED USING REAL-TIME PCR IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF DIABETIC RATS. TREATMENT WITH METFORMIN/DONEPEZIL COMBINATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE ACTIVITIES OF ACHE, BCHE AS WELL AS LEVELS OF MALONDIALDEHYDE, TNF-Œ± AND IL-6, WHILE THE ACTIVITIES OF SOD, GPX AND CATALASE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE BRAIN. MOREOVER, EXPRESSION OF ER STRESS MARKERS WAS ATTENUATED IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS. METFORMIN/DONEPEZIL COMBINATION APPEARED MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN METFORMIN ONLY AND COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR MANAGING DIABETES-ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA.

Structure‚Äìactivity relationship showed that the substitution of ‚ÄìBr group influenced the inhibitory activity against BCHE enzyme. Synthesized compounds were found to be selective inhibitors of BCHE. In addition, all compounds 1‚Äì12 were found to be non-cytotoxic, as compared to the standard cycloheximide (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.8‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.2‚ÄØ¬µM). Among them, compound 3 revealed the most potent BCHE inhibitory activity (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.8‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.6‚ÄØ¬µM) when compared with the standard galantamine hydrobromide (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ40.83‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.37‚ÄØ¬µM). Enzyme kinetic studies indicated that compounds 1, 3‚Äì4, and 7‚Äì8 showed a mixed mode of inhibition against BCHE, while compounds 2, 5‚Äì6 and 9 exhibited an uncompetitive pattern of inhibition. Molecular docking studies further highlighted the interaction of these inhibitors with catalytically important amino acid residues, such as Glu197, Hip438, Phe329, and many others.

The butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) gene has been found in several types of teleost fish but this gene has yet to be identified in cyprinid fish. Indeed, BChE homologs have not been found in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genomic database. Here, we demonstrate that BChE activity is present in zebrafish, in line with other groups' findings. Using in-gel native-PAGE enzymatic activity staining and LC-MS/MS technique, an atypical BChE-like protein was identified in zebrafish. The si:ch211-93f2.1 gene was cloned, and His-tagged recombinant protein was expressed using the Pichia yeast system. The purified protein (molecular weight¬ ~¬ 180¬ kDa) showed BChE activity, and degraded acetylcholinesterase (ACh) at a higher rate than BCh. However, phylogram analysis shows that this novel cholinesterase shared an evolutionary origin with carboxylic esterase rather than BChE. The zebrafish BChE-like protein shares structural characteristics with cholinesterase and carboxylesterase. The 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), nicosulfuron, and triacetin exhibited a higher binding affinity to the zebrafish BChE-like protein than BCh and ACh. With the identification of BChE-like protein in zebrafish, this study could shed light on the origin of BChE and may contribute towards the development of a BChE knockout zebrafish model for sensitive drug or toxin screening.

HERE, ALL-ATOM MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE WITH TACRINE COMPLEX WERE DESIGNED TO CHARACTERIZE INHIBITOR BINDING MODES, STRENGTHS, AND THE HYDROGEN-BOND DEPENDENT NON-COVALENT RELEASE MECHANISM. FOUR POSSIBLE RELEASE CHANNELS WERE IDENTIFIED, AND THE MOST FAVORABLE CHANNEL WAS DETERMINED BY RANDOM ACCELERATION MOLECULAR DYNAMICS MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (RAMD MD) SIMULATIONS. THE THERMODYNAMIC AND DYNAMIC PROPERTIES AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING DETOUR-FORWARD DELIVERY MECHANISM WERE DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THE CLASSICAL MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS ACCOMPANIED WITH UMBRELLA SAMPLING. THE FREE ENERGY BARRIER OF THE TACRINE RELEASE PROCESS FOR THE MOST BENEFICIAL PATHWAY IS ABOUT 10.95 KCAL/MOL, WHICH IS RELATED TO THE NON-COVALENT INTERACTIONS FROM THE SURROUNDING RESIDUES, REVEALING THE SPECIFIC BINDING CHARACTERISTICS IN THE ACTIVE SITE. THE RESIDUES INCLUDING ASP70, SER79, TRP82, GLY116, THR120, TYR332, AND HIS438 WERE IDENTIFIED TO PLAY MAJOR ROLES IN THE STABILIZATION OF TACRINE IN THE POCKET OF BCHE, WHERE HYDROGEN BONDING AND œÄ-œÄ INTERACTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS. TYR332 AND ASP70, WHICH ACT AS GATE KEEPERS, PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN THE SUBSTRATE DELIVERY. THE PRESENT RESULTS PROVIDE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING FOR THE LIGAND TRANSPORT MECHANISM DEPENDING ON THE BCHE ENZYMATIC ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR THE DESIGN OF BCHE INHIBITORS IN THE FUTURE.

AMONG THE ANTIDOTES IN USE TODAY AGAINST THESE AGENTS, OXIMES IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER DRUGS ARE THE ONLY TREATMENT WITH ANY ACTION. HI-6 AND 2-PAM ARE CATIONIC OXIMES PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE REACTIVATION OF ACHE INHIBITED BY THE NERVE AGENTS VX AND SARIN (GB). HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO REACTIVATION OF ACHE INSIDE THE CENTRAL OR PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS, CHARGED MOLECULES PRESENT LOW DIFFUSION DUE TO LOW PENETRATION THROUGH THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER. UNCHARGED OXIMES APPEAR AS AN INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF MORE EFFICIENT UNCHARGED OXIMES CAPABLE OF REACTIVATING HUMAN ACHE IS STILL NECESSARY. GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS FOR IN VIVO AND IN VITRO EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WITH NERVE AGENTS, MODELING IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE EFFICIENCY OF UNCHARGED OXIMES. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERACTION AND BEHAVIOR OF CATIONIC AND UNCHARGED OXIMES, WE PERFORMED HERE MOLECULAR DOCKING, MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS, AND BINDING ENERGIES CALCULATIONS OF THE KNOWN CATIONIC OXIMES HI-6 AND 2-PAM PLUS FOUR UNCHARGED OXIMES FOUND IN THE LITERATURE, COMPLEXED WITH HUMAN ACHE ( ACHE) CONJUGATED WITH THE NERVE AGENTS VX AND GB. THE UNCHARGED OXIMES SHOWED DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS, ESPECIALLY RS194B, WHICH PRESENTED STABILITY INSIDE ACHE-VX, BUT PRESENTED FREE BINDING ENERGY LOWER THAN CATIONIC OXIMES, SUGGESTING THAT STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS COULD FAVOR ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THESE COMPLEXES. IN CONTRAST, HI-6 AND 2-PAM SHOWED HIGHER AFFINITIES WITH MORE NEGATIVE BINDING ENERGY VALUES AND LARGER CONTRIBUTION OF THE AMINO ACID ASP74, DEMONSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE QUATERNARY NITROGEN TO THE AFFINITY AND INTERACTION OF OXIMES WITH ACHE-GB AND ACHE-VX CONJUGATES.

WHILE ACHE REGULATES NEUROTRANSMISSION BY HYDROLYZING ACETYLCHOLINE AT THE POSTSYNAPTIC MEMBRANES AND NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTIONS, BCHE IN PLASMA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO BE INVOLVED IN DETOXIFYING TOXIC COMPOUNDS. THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY OF CIRCULATING CHE ACTIVITY IN PLASMAS FROM DOMESTIC ANIMALS (BOVINE, OVINE, CAPRINE, PORCINE AND EQUINE) BY ASSESSING SENSITIVITY TO ACHE-SPECIFIC INHIBITORS (BW284C51 AND EDROPHONIUM) AND BCHE-SPECIFIC INHIBITORS (DIBUCAINE, ETHOPROPAZINE AND ISO-OMPA) AS WELL AS BINDING TO ANTI-FBS ACHE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS). BASED ON THE INHIBITION OF CHE ACTIVITY BY CHE-SPECIFIC INHIBITORS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT BOVINE, OVINE AND CAPRINE PLASMA PREDOMINANTLY CONTAIN ACHE, WHILE PORCINE AND EQUINE PLASMA CONTAIN BCHE. THREE OF THE ANTI-FBS ACHE MABS, 4E5, 5E8 AND 6H9, INHIBITED 85-98% OF ENZYME ACTIVITY IN BOVINE, OVINE AND CAPRINE PLASMA, CONFIRMING THAT THE ESTERASE IN THESE PLASMAS WAS ACHE. THESE MABS DID NOT BIND TO PURIFIED RECOMBINANT HUMAN OR MOUSE ACHE, DEMONSTRATING THAT THESE MABS WERE SPECIFIC FOR ACHES FROM RUMINANT SPECIES. THESE MABS DID NOT INHIBIT THE ACTIVITY OF PURIFIED HUMAN BCHE, OR CHE ACTIVITY IN PORCINE AND EQUINE PLASMA, CONFIRMING THAT THE CHE IN THESE PLASMAS WAS BCHE. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ANTI-FBS ACHE MABS CAN SERVE AS USEFUL TOOLS FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ACHES FROM RUMINANT AND NON-RUMINANT SPECIES AND BCHES.

THE PRESENT DESIGN AIMS TO PROVIDE AN INSIGHT INTO THE MEDICINAL POTENTIAL OF FOUR SOLVENT EXTRACTS OF C. POLYGONOIDES VIA AN ASSESSMENT OF ITS PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILE, ANTIOXIDANT AND ENZYME INHIBITORY POTENTIAL. PHYTOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION WAS ESTIMATED BY DEDUCING TOTAL BIOACTIVE CONSTITUENTS, UHPLC-MS SECONDARY METABOLITES PROFILE, AND HPLC PHENOLIC QUANTIFICATION. ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL WAS DETERMINED VIA SIX METHODS (RADICAL SCAVENGING (DPPH AND ABTS), REDUCING POWER (FRAP AND CUPRAC), PHOSPHOMOLYBDENUM TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY AND METAL CHELATION ACTIVITY). ENZYME INHIBITORY POTENTIAL WAS ASSESSED AGAINST CLINICAL ENZYMES (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE -ACHE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE -BCHE, TYROSINASE, AND Œ±-AMYLASE). THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF PHENOLIC CONTENTS WERE FOUND IN CHLOROFORM EXTRACT (76.59¬†MG GAE/G EXTRACT) WHICH MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO ITS HIGHER RADICAL SCAVENGING, REDUCING POWER AND TYROSINASE INHIBITION POTENTIAL. THE N-BUTANOL EXTRACT CONTAINING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FLAVONOIDS (55.84¬†MG RE/G EXTRACT) EXHIBITED HIGHEST METAL CHELATING CAPACITY. SIMILARLY, THE N-HEXANE EXTRACT WAS FOUND TO BE MOST ACTIVE AGAINST ACHE (4.65¬†MG GALAE/G EXTRACT), BCHE (6.59¬†MG GALAE/G EXTRACT), AND Œ±-AMYLASE (0.70¬†MMOL ACAE/G EXTRACT) ENZYMES. SECONDARY METABOLITE ASSESSMENT OF THE CRUDE METHANOL EXTRACT AS DETERMINED BY UHPLC-MS ANALYSIS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF 24 (NEGATIVE IONIZATION MODE) AND 15 (POSITIVE IONIZATION MODE) SECONDARY METABOLITES, WITH MOST OF THEM BELONGING TO PHENOLIC, FLAVONOIDS, TERPENE, AND ALKALOID GROUPS. MOREOVER, GALLIC ACID AND NARINGENIN WERE THE MAIN PHENOLICS QUANTIFIED BY HPLC-PDA ANALYSIS IN ALL THE TESTED EXTRACTS (EXCEPT N-BUTANOL EXTRACT). PCA STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS ALSO CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH ANY POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP AMONGST BIOACTIVE CONTENTS AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. OVERALL, THE C. POLYGONOIDES EXTRACTS COULD BE FURTHER CONSIDERED TO ISOLATE BIOACTIVE ENZYME INHIBITORY AND ANTIOXIDANT NATURAL PHYTOCOMPOUNDS.

In combination with tetrameric butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the most potent binding side chain was identified, and the information obtained was further used for the synthesis of a multivalent BChE inhibitor. In the in vitro biological evaluation, this multivalent inhibitor exhibited not only better inhibitory effect than the commercial reference but also high selectivity on BChE over acetylcholinesterase (AChE).

THAT IS WHY WE DESIGNED TWENTY-TWO ANALOGUES OF A DUAL ACHEBUCHE SALICYLANILIDE INHIBITOR, N-[3,5-BIS(TRIFLUOROMETHYL)PHENYL]-5-BROMO-2-HYDROXYBENZAMIDE 1, TO IMPROVE ITS POTENCY. WE PREPARED N,N-DISUBSTITUTED (THIO)CARBAMATES VIA DIRECT ACYLATION WITH (THIO)CARBAMOYL CHLORIDE, N-N-ALKYL MONOSUBSTITUTED CARBAMATES USING ISOCYANATES AS WELL AS ITS SALICYLANILIDE CORE ANALOGUES. THE DERIVATIVES WERE EVALUATED IN VITRO AGAINST ACHE FROM ELECTRIC EEL AND BUCHE FROM EQUINE SERUM USING SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ELLMAN'S METHOD. THE COMPOUNDS SHOWED MODERATE INHIBITION OF BOTH ACHE AND BUCHE WITH IC50 FROM 18.2 TO 196.6 ŒºMOL.L-1 AND 9.2 TO 196.2 ŒºMOL.L-1, RESPECTIVELY. IMPORTANTLY, BASED ON THE SUBSTITUTION PATTERN, IT IS POSSIBLE TO MODULATE SELECTIVITY AGAINST ACHE OR BUCHE AND SOME DERIVATIVES ALSO PRODUCED A BALANCED INHIBITION. IN GENERAL, THE MOST PROMISING ANALOGUES WERE N-ALKYL (C2-C6) CARBAMATES AND ISOMERS WITH A CHANGED POSITION OF PHENOLIC HYDROXYL. N-[3,5-BIS(TRIFLUOROMETHYL)PHENYL]-3-BROMO-5- HYDROXYBENZAMIDE 4A WAS THE BEST INHIBITOR OF BOTH CHOLINESTERASES. A WIDE RANGE OF THE DERIVATIVES IMPROVED THE ACTIVITY OF THE HIT 1, THEY WERE SUPERIOR TO CARBAMATE DRUG RIVASTIGMINE AGAINST ACHE AND SOME OF THEM ALSO AGAINST BUCHE. THE MOST PROMISING DERIVATIVES ALSO FIT PHYSICOCHEMICAL SPACE AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES FOR CNS DRUGS TOGETHER WITH AN ESCALATED LIPOPHILICITY.

THE COMPOUNDS HAVE SHOWN CONSIDERABLE PROMISE AS BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) INHIBITORS. ALTHOUGH THE INHIBITION OF EEL ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (EEACHE) WAS WEAK, THE INHIBITIONS AGAINST EQUINE BUCHE (EQBUCHE) AND HUMAN BUCHE (HBUCHE) WERE MORE SIGNIFICANT WITH A BEST INHIBITION AGAINST EQBUCHE OF 0.46¬†ŒºM. IN SOME CASES, THESE MOLECULES GAVE BETTER INHIBITIONS FOR HBUCHE THAN EQBUCHE.

IN OUR AIM TO DEVELOP NEW ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S AGENTS, A SERIES OF 36 NEW N-ALKYLPIPERIDINE CARBAMATES WAS DESIGNED, SYNTHESIZED AND EVALUATED FOR THE INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASES [ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE)] AND MONOAMINE OXIDASES [MONOAMINE OXIDASE A (MAO-A AND MONOAMINE OXIDASE B (MAO-B)]. FOUR COMPOUNDS ARE VERY PROMISING: MULTIPLE ACHE (IC ¬†=¬†7.31¬†ŒºM), BCHE (IC ¬†=¬†0.56¬†ŒºM) AND MAO-B (IC ¬†=¬†26.1¬†ŒºM) INHIBITOR 10, DUAL ACHE (IC ¬†=¬†2.25¬†ŒºM) AND BCHE (IC ¬†=¬†0.81¬†ŒºM) INHIBITOR 22, SELECTIVE BCHE (IC ¬†=¬†0.06¬†ŒºM) INHIBITOR 13, AND SELECTIVE MAO-B (IC ¬†=¬†0.18¬†ŒºM) INHIBITOR 16. RESULTS OF ENZYME KINETICS EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT DESPITE THE CARBAMATE GROUP IN THE STRUCTURE, COMPOUNDS 10, 13, AND 22 ARE REVERSIBLE AND NON-TIME-DEPENDENT INHIBITORS OF ACHE AND/OR BCHE. THE RESOLVED CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMPLEX OF BCHE WITH COMPOUND 13 CONFIRMED THE NON-COVALENT MECHANISM OF INHIBITION. ADDITIONALLY, N-PROPARGYLPIPERIDINE 16 IS AN IRREVERSIBLE AND TIME-DEPENDENT INHIBITOR OF MAO-B, WHILE N-BENZYLPIPERIDINE 10 IS REVERSIBLE. ADDITIONALLY, COMPOUNDS 10, 13, 16, AND 22 SHOULD BE ABLE TO CROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER AND ARE NOT CYTOTOXIC TO HUMAN NEURONAL-LIKE SH-SY5Y AND LIVER HEPG2 CELLS. FINALLY, COMPOUNDS 10 AND 16 ALSO PREVENT AMYLOID Œ≤  (AŒ≤ )-INDUCED NEURONAL CELL DEATH. THE NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF COMPOUND 16 COULD BE THE RESULT OF ITS AŒ≤  ANTI-AGGREGATION EFFECTS.

Acetylcholine extracellular levels were measured by microdialysis coupled with HPLC; acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity were measured with colorimetric and radiometric methods. It was found that comparable 2‚Äì3 fold increases in cortical extracellular acetylcholine level, calculated as areas under the curve, followed the administration of the three drugs at the doses used. At the peak of acetylcholine increase, a 27% acetylcholinesterase inhibition and no butyrylcholinesterase inhibition was found after donepezil (1¬ mg/kg, i.p) administration. At the same time point, rivastigmine (0.6¬ mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited acetylcholinesterase by 40% and butyrylcholinesterase by 25%. After PEC (5¬ mg/kg, i.p.) administration, there was a 39% butyrylcholinesterase inhibition and no effect on acetylcholinesterase. Since in the present study it was also confirmed that in the brain butyrylcholinesterase activity is only about 10% of acetylcholinesterase activity, it is surprising that its partial inhibition is sufficient to increase extracellular acetylcholine levels. The importance of butyrylcholinesterase as a ‚Äúco-regulator‚Ä  of synaptic acetylcholine levels should thus be reconsidered.

ADMINISTERED 15¬†MG/KG BODY WEIGHT OF COLISTIN, AND ORALLY RECEIVED 100¬†MG/KG BODY WEIGHT OF RUTIN). ADMINISTRATION OF COLISTIN INCREASED LEVELS OF GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN AND BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR AND ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES WHILE DECREASING LEVEL OF CYCLIC AMP RESPONSE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN AND EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL REGULATED KINASES 1 AND 2 (ERK1/2) EXPRESSIONS. COLISTIN INCREASED OXIDATIVE IMPAIRMENTS AS EVIDENCED BY A DECREASE IN LEVEL OF NUCLEAR FACTOR ERYTHROID 2-RELATED FACTOR 2 (NRF-2), GLUTATHIONE, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE AND CATALASE ACTIVITIES, AND INCREASED MALONDIALDEHYDE CONTENT. COLISTIN ALSO INCREASED THE LEVELS OF THE APOPTOTIC AND INFLAMMATORIC PARAMETERS SUCH AS CYSTEINE ASPARTATE SPECIFIC PROTEASE-3 (CASPASE-3), P53, B-CELL LYMPHOMA-2 (BCL-2), NUCLEAR FACTOR KAPPA B (NF-Œ∫B), BCL-2 ASSOCIATED X PROTEIN (BAX), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) AND NEURONAL NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE (NNOS). RUTIN TREATMENT RESTORED THE BRAIN FUNCTION BY ATTENUATING COLISTIN-INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS, APOPTOSIS, INFLAMMATION, HISTOPATHOLOGICAL AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ALTERATION SUGGESTING THAT RUTIN SUPPLEMENTATION MITIGATED COLISTIN-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY IN MALE RATS.

HERE, WE REPORT AN EXTENSION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN SILICO SCREENING, WHERE WE SELECTED FOUR NEW COMPOUNDS AS ACHE INHIBITORS. FURTHER, BASED ON FAVORABLE BINDING POSSESS, MD SIMULATION AND MMGBSA, TWO MOST PROMISING COMPOUNDS (3A AND 3B) WERE SELECTED, KEEPING IN VIEW THE EASE OF SYNTHESIS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS. DUE TO THE CRITICAL ROLE OF BCHE, LOX AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE IN NEURODEGENERATION, THE SELECTED COMPOUNDS WERE ALSO SCREENED AGAINST THESE ENZYMES. THE IC  VALUES OF 3A AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE FOUND TO BE 12.53 AND 352.42 ŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. MODERATE TO SLIGHT INHIBITIONS OF 45.26 % AND 28.68 % WERE PRESENTED BY 3A AGAINST LOX AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, RESPECTIVELY, AT 0.5¬ÄØMM. INSIGNIFICANT INHIBITIONS WERE OBSERVED WITH 3B AGAINST THE FOUR SELECTED ENZYMES. FURTHER, IN VIVO TRIAL DEMONSTRATED THAT 3A COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISH ACHE LEVELS IN THE MICE BRAIN AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THESE FINDINGS WERE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BRAIN TISSUES. THE RESULTS CORROBORATE THAT SELECTED COMPOUNDS COULD SERVE AS A POTENTIAL LEAD FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION AS ACHE INHIBITORS TO ACHIEVE COST-EFFECTIVE ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S DRUGS.

PHOSPHAZINES (5-7) WERE SYNTHESIZED SMOOTHLY VIA A REDOX-CONDENSATION REACTION OF 1,2-BIS(DIPHENYLPHOSPHINO)ETHANE WITH DIFFERENT AMINES DERIVATIVES IN THE PRESENCE OF DIALKYL AZODICARBOXYLATE (STAUDINGER REACTION) WHILE PHOSPHAZIDES (8) VIA ELECTROPHILIC ATTACK OF AZIDO DERIVATIVES. STRUCTURES OF THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS WERE JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF COMPATIBLE ELEMENTARY AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSES. ALL THE COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED FOR THEIR ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. THE MOST THREE POTENT COMPOUNDS (5B-C AND 8B) SHOWING ACHE IC  VALUES (29.85-34.96¬†NM) COMPARABLE TO THAT OF DONEPEZIL (34.42¬†NM) WERE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY TESTING THEIR BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, MMP-2 AND SELF-INDUCED AŒ≤ AGGREGATION INHIBITION ACTIVITY. ESPECIALLY, THE COUMARIN PHOSPHAZIDE DERIVATIVE (8B) PRESENTED THE BEST ACHE INHIBITION SELECTIVITY INDEX (IC ¬†=¬†34.96¬†NM, ACHE/BUCHE; 3.81) TOGETHER WITH GOOD INHIBITION ABILITY AGAINST MMP-2 (IC ¬†=¬†441.33¬†NM) AND SELF-INDUCED AŒ≤  AGGREGATION (IC ¬†=¬†337.77¬†NM). IN ADDITION, THE INHIBITION OF METAL-INDUCED AŒ≤ AGGREGATION BY 8B WAS CONFIRMED BY THIOFLAVINE T FLUORESCENCE. THE MOST POTENT EFFECT OF 8B WAS OBSERVED ON THE ZN -INDUCED AŒ≤  AGGREGATION. KINETIC STUDY OF COMPOUND 8B SUGGESTED IT TO BE A COMPETITIVE ACHE INHIBITOR. ALSO, IT SPECIFICALLY CHELATES METAL AND IS PREDICTED TO BE PERMEABLE TO BBB. IT ALSO POSSESSES LOW TOXICITY ON SH-SY5Y NEUROBLASTOMA CELLS WITH A SAFETY INDEX OF 15.37. IN ADDITION, IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT COMPOUND 8B CAN IMPROVE THE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT OF SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED MODEL IN MICE WITH % ALTERNATIONS AND TRANSFER LATENCY TIME COMPARABLE TO THAT OF DONEPEZIL. ALSO, A DOCKING STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AND IT WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IN VITRO RESULTS.

COMPOUNDS  ,  ,  , AND   EXHIBITED SELECTIVE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ( BUCHE) INHIBITION WITH IC  VALUES RANGING FROM 24 TO 607 NM. AMONG THEM, COMPOUND 3B WAS THE MOST ACTIVE (IC  = 24 NM). ADDITIONALLY, 3C (IC  FOR  ACHE = 25 NM AND IC  FOR  BUCHE = 123 NM) DISPLAYED DUAL CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AND WAS THE MOST ACTIVE COMPOUND AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE). ACTIVE COMPOUND 3C WAS ALSO TESTED FOR THE ABILITY TO INHIBIT AŒ≤ AGGREGATION. THEORETICAL PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COMPOUNDS WERE CALCULATED USING ACD LABS PERCEPTA AND CHEMAXON. A LINEWEAVER-BURK PLOT AND DOCKING STUDY SHOWED THAT 3C TARGETED BOTH THE CATALYTIC ACTIVE SITE (CAS) AND THE PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE (PAS) OF ACHE. MOREOVER, 3C APPEARS TO POSSESS NEUROPROTECTIVE ACTIVITY AND COULD BE CONSIDERED A FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGER. IN ADDITION, 3C DID NOT CAUSE DNA DAMAGE AND WAS FOUND TO BE LESS TOXIC THAN TACRINE AFTER ORAL ADMINISTRATION; IT ALSO DEMONSTRATED LITTLE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY TOWARDS HYALURONIDASE (HYAL), WHICH MAY INDICATE THAT IT POSSESSES ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES. THE SCREENING FOR NEW IN VIVO INTERACTIONS BETWEEN 3C AND KNOWN RECEPTORS WAS REALIZED BY YEAST THREE-HYBRID TECHNOLOGY (Y3H).

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF NICOTINAMIDE (NAM) ON THE ACTIVITIES, EXPRESSION AND PROTEIN CONTENT OF CHOLINESTERASES IN A METS MODEL. METS WAS INDUCED IN MALE RATS ADMINISTRATING 40% FRUCTOSE TO THE DRINKING WATER FOR 16¬ÄØWEEKS. ADDITIONALLY, FROM 5TH WEEK ONWARD, THE CARBOHYDRATE SOLUTION WAS REPLACED BY NAM, AT SEVERAL CONCENTRATIONS FOR 5¬ÄØH EACH MORNING FOR THE NEXT 12¬ÄØWEEKS. IN THE 15TH WEEK, THE GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST WAS CONDUCTED, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WAS MEASURED. AFTER THE TREATMENT PERIOD HAD CONCLUDED, THE BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE; OXIDANT STRESS; PROINFLAMMATORY MARKERS; AND THE ACTIVITY, QUANTITY AND EXPRESSION OF CHOLINESTERASES WERE EVALUATED, AND MOLECULAR DOCKING ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. THE METS GROUP SHOWED ANTHROPOMETRIC, HEMODYNAMIC AND BIOCHEMICAL ALTERATIONS AND INCREASED CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY, INFLAMMATION AND STRESS MARKERS. IN THE LIVER, CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY AND MRNA, FREE FATTY ACID, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-Œ±), AND THIOBARBITURIC ACID-REACTIVE SUBSTANCE (TBARS) LEVELS WERE INCREASED, WHILE REDUCED GLUTATHIONE (GSH) LEVELS WERE DECREASED. NAM PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY DECREASED RISK FACTORS FOR METS, MARKERS OF STRESS AND INFLAMMATION, AND THE ACTIVITY (SERUM AND LIVER) AND EXPRESSION (LIVER) OF CHOLINESTERASES. MOLECULAR DOCKING ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT NAM HAS A GREATER AFFINITY FOR CHOLINESTERASES THAN ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH), SUGGESTING NAM AS AN INHIBITOR OF CHOLINESTERASES. SUPPLEMENTATION WITH 40% FRUCTOSE INDUCED METS, WHICH INCREASED THE ACTIVITY AND EXPRESSION OF CHOLINESTERASES, OXIDATIVE STRESS AND THE INFLAMMATION. NAM ATTENUATED THESE METS-INDUCED ALTERATIONS AND CHANGES IN CHOLINESTERASES.

THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE ALTERATION OF AROMATIC RING CONNECTING TO CHROMONE SCAFFOLD BRINGS ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. COMPARED WITH FLAVONES, THE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF 2-NAPHTHYL CHROMONE, 2-ANTHRYL-CHROMONE DERIVATIVES AGAINST ACHE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED, WHILE THAT OF 2-BIPHENYL CHROMONE DERIVATIVES WITH 7-SUBSTITUTED TERTIARY AMINE SIDE CHAIN IS BETTER THAN RELATIVE FLAVONES DERIVATIVES. FOR ALL NEW SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS, THE POSITION OF TERTIARY AMINE SIDE CHAIN OBVIOUSLY INFLUENCED THE ACTIVITY OF INHIBITING ACHE. THE RESULTS ABOVE PROVIDE GREAT WORTHY INFORMATION FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ACHE INHIBITORS. AMONG THE NEWLY SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS, COMPOUND 5A IS POTENT IN ACHE INHIBITION (IC  = 1.29¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ0.10 ŒºMOL/L) WITH HIGH SELECTIVITY FOR ACHE OVER BCHE (SELECTIVITY RATIO: 27.96). AN ENZYME KINETIC STUDY OF COMPOUND 5A SUGGESTS THAT IT PRODUCES A MIXED-TYPE INHIBITORY EFFECT AGAINST ACHE.

ANALYST 1364-5528 145 4305-4313 2020 10.1039/d0an00924e AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD); THUS, THE NEED FOR A METHOD TO DETECT AD EARLY AND SENSITIVELY HAS BECOME URGENT, AND THE DEMAND FOR AN INTELLIGENT ANALYTICAL PLATFORM IS GROWING YEAR BY YEAR. ABNORMAL LEVELS OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ARE KNOWN TO BE INDICATIVE OF AD. IN THIS WORK, A NOVEL CONJUGATED POLYTHIOPHENE (CP) COMPOUND WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMBINED WITH CDTE QUANTUM DOTS (QDS) TO IMPROVE THEIR SELECTIVITY AND SENSITIVITY. THE QDS SUCCESSFULLY ENABLED THE DETECTION OF LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF ACHE BY TURNING ON THE FLUORESCENCE OF THE CDTE/CP VIA THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CP AND THIOCHOLINE PRODUCED BY ATCH HYDROLYSIS AND AGGREGATION INDUCED EMISSION ENHANCEMENT (AIEE). UNDER OPTIMAL CONDITIONS, WE REACHED A LOW DETECTION LIMIT OF 0.14 U L , WHICH IS 7.9 TIMES LOWER THAN THAT OF PRISTINE QDS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, AN EFFICIENT, INEXPENSIVE, AND DISPOSABLE PAPER-BASED PLATFORM, WHICH ALLOWS THE EFFICIENT VISUAL DETECTION OF ACHE ACTIVITY VIA THE COLOR VARIATION OF CDTE/CP, WAS DESIGNED. MOREOVER, THE ACCURACY OF THE METHOD WAS DEMONSTRATED BY CONDUCTING A RECOVERY TEST IN HUMAN SERUM, IN WHICH THE RECOVERIES REACHED 107% AND 110%, PROVING THAT CDTE/CP HAS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO BE USED FOR ANALYZING REAL BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS METHOD ARE ITS SIMPLICITY, FAST DETECTION CAPABILITY, AFFORDABILITY, AND THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE USED FOR ON-SITE DETECTION OF ACHE ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS CERTAIN GUIDING SIGNIFICANCE FOR DETECTING AD.

ARCH PHARM (WEINHEIM) 1521-4184 353 E2000030 2020 10.1002/ardp.202000030 IN THIS STUDY, 3,4-DIHYDRO-12-ARYL-1H-BENZO[B]XANTHENE-1,6,11-(2H,12H)TRIONE COMPOUNDS WERE OBTAINED THROUGH ONE-POT CONDENSATION OF VARIOUS SUBSTITUTED AROMATIC ALDEHYDES, 2-HYDROXY-1,4-NAPHTHOQUINONE, AND DIMEDONE IN THE PRESENCE OF BI(OTF)  AS A GREEN AND REUSABLE CATALYST. THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE NOVEL SUBSTITUTED BENZO[B]XANTHENES WAS PERFORMED BY SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS, AND THEIR INHIBITORY ACTIONS AGAINST BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), AND GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (GST) WERE INVESTIGATED. GST IS AN ENZYME RESPONSIBLE FOR REMOVING TOXIC MOLECULES DURING PHASE II REACTIONS IN THE DETOXIFICATION MECHANISM. THE ACHE AND BCHE ENZYMES, WHICH ARE CALLED CHOLINESTERASES, ARE AMONG THE ENZYMES THAT OCCUR ESPECIALLY DURING DEMENTIA SUCH AS BRAIN DAMAGE OR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. INHIBITION EFFECTS OF THE BENZO[B]XANTHENE DERIVATIVES ON ACHE, BCHE, AND GST WERE FOUND AT THE MILLIMOLAR LEVEL. THE BEST INHIBITOR FOR GST IS COMPOUND 4A (31.18¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ6.13¬ÄâMM), FOR ACHE, IT IS COMPOUND 4D (28.16¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ3.46¬ÄâMM), AND FOR BCHE, IT IS COMPOUND 4F (36.24¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ3.19¬ÄâMM). COMPOUND 4A INHIBITED THE DIMERIZATION OF GST SUBUNITS, AND COMPOUNDS 4D AND 4F DIRECTLY INHIBITED THE CATALYTIC ACTIVITY BY INTERACTING WITH THE CATALYTIC ACTIVE SITE OR A RELATED SITE OF THE ACHE AND BCHE ENZYMES, RESPECTIVELY.

J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 44 E13169 2019 10.1111/jfbc.13169 IN THIS STUDY, WE ATTEMPTED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO DETERMINE THE PHYTOCHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE METHANOLIC AND AQUEOUS EXTRACTS OF MORINDA MORINDOIDES FRUITS AND SEEDS. ANTIOXIDANT PROPENSITIES OF THE EXTRACTS WERE DETERMINED VIA FREE RADICAL-SCAVENGING, PHOSPHOMOLYBDENUM, METAL CHELATING, AND REDUCING POWER ASSAYS. INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST CHOLINESTERASES (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE)), TYROSINASE, Œ±-AMYLASE, AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE WERE ASSESSED. MOREOVER, THE TOTAL PHENOLIC AND FLAVONOID CONTENTS WERE DETERMINED. HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION QUADRUPOLE TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY (HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO ESTABLISH THE CHEMICAL PROFILE OF THE INVESTIGATED EXTRACTS. THE TESTED EXTRACTS SHOWED REMARKABLE ANTIOXIDANT ABILITIES WITH AQUEOUS FRUIT EXTRACT BEING MOST POTENT IN ALL ASSAYS, EXCEPT FOR FERROUS ION CHELATING ASSAY. OVERALL, THE METHANOLIC EXTRACTS WERE POTENT INHIBITORS OF THE TESTED ENZYMES. IN CONCLUSION, M. MORINDOIDES MAY BE ENDORSED AS PROMISING SOURCES OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND USED FOR DESIGNING FUNCTIONAL FOODS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: IN RECENT YEARS, NEW COMPOUNDS FROM PLANT SOURCES HAVE ATTRACTED GREAT INTEREST TO DESIGN FUNCTIONAL FOODS. THUS, WE AIMED TO DETECT BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MORINDA MORINDOIDES FRUITS AND SEEDS, A WIDELY USED AS FOOD WITH MEDICINAL PROPERTIES IN AFRICA. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, FRUITS EXTRACTS EXHIBITED STRONGER ACTIVITY WHEN COMPARED TO SEED EXTRACTS. ALSO, CHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION WAS PERFORMED FOR EACH EXTRACTS. THE PRESENTED FINDINGS COULD PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION INTO THE POOL OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND MAY BE BASIS FOR THE DESIGN OF NOVEL FUNCTIONAL APPLICATIONS FROM M. MORINDOIDES.

Synthesized compounds were classified into two series of 5a-i and 5j-q considering the position of positively charged nitrogen of pyridinium moiety (3- or 4- position, respectively) connected to isoxazole carboxamide group. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 5n from the second series of compounds possessing 2,4-dichloroaryl group connected to isoxazole ring was found to be the most potent AChE inhibitor (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ5.96‚ÄØ¬µM) and compound 5j also from the same series of compounds containing phenyl group connected to isoxazole ring demonstrated the most promising inhibitory activity against BChE (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.32‚ÄØ¬µM). Also, kinetic study demonstrated competitive inhibition mode for both AChE and BChE inhibitory activity. Docking study was also performed for those compounds and desired interactions with those active site amino acid residues were confirmed through hydrogen bonding as well as œÄ-œÄ and œÄ-anion interactions. In addition, the most potent compounds were tested against BACE1 and their neuroprotectivity on AŒ≤-treated neurotoxicity in PC12 cells which depicted negligible activity. It should be noted that most of the synthesized compounds from both categories 5a-i and 5j-q showed a significant selectivity toward BChE. However, series 5j-q were more active toward AChE than series 5a-i.

Allylic oxidation with selenium oxide and Jones‚Äôs oxidation were employed to obtain mono-, di- and tri-oxolupanes, starting from calenduladiol (1) and lupeol (3). All the derivatives showed a selective inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase over acetylcholinesterase (BChE vs. AChE). A kinetic study proved that compounds 2 and 9, the more potent inhibitors of the series, act as competitive inhibitors. Molecular modeling was used to understand their interaction with BChE, the role of carbonyl at C-16 and the selectivity towards this enzyme over AChE. These results indicate that oxidation at C-16 of the lupane skeleton is a key transformation in order to improve the cholinesterase inhibition of these compounds.

SENSORS (BASEL) 1424-8220 19 NA 2019 10.3390/s19183856 THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE USE OF A BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE)-BASED, REVERSIBLE REACTION BIOSENSOR USING SCREEN-PRINTED ELECTRODES (SPES) HAVING A SMALLER WORKING SURFACE AREA THAN THE SINGLE-USE ELECTRODES PREVIOUSLY STUDIED. PREVIOUS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THE PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF A SINGLE-USE BIOSENSOR FABRICATED WITH AN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) ENZYME ENCAPSULATED IN PEPTIDE NANOTUBES (PNTS) AND ENHANCED WITH HORSERADISH PEROXIDASE (HRP) TO DETECT ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS (OPCS) IN AQUEOUS AND GAS PHASES. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BIOSENSOR ARE INVESTIGATED. BCHE-BASED BIOSENSORS WERE FABRICATED USING PNTS, HRP, AND NAFION IN COMBINATION TO INCREASE THE REACTIVE SURFACE AREA, ENHANCE SENSITIVITY, AND MAINTAIN ENZYME STABILITY. CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY (CV) WAS USED ALONG WITH THE NEW MODIFIED SENSOR TO MEASURE MALATHION CONCENTRATION IN THE GAS PHASE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT A BCHE-BASED BIOSENSOR COULD RELIABLY MEASURE GAS PHASE MALATHION CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN 6-25 PPBV BY CV WITH THE EXTENT OF INHIBITION LINEARLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE MALATHION CONCENTRATION (R  = 0.941). THIS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THAT FABRICATED BCHE-BASED BIOSENSORS COULD BE STORED WITHOUT COLD STORAGE REQUIREMENT FOR UP TO SIX WEEKS WITH MINIMAL PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION. MOREOVER, THE SENSOR ELECTRODES WERE EACH REUSED SEVERAL TIMES, AND WERE STILL USEABLE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE RESEARCH. THIS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL OF FABRICATING A REUSABLE, INEXPENSIVE BIOSENSOR THAT IS CAPABLE OF OPC DETECTION WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND A LOW DETECTION LIMIT WITHOUT A LONG-TERM COLD STORAGE REQUIREMENT.
SANTANA MS;SANDRINI-NETO L;DI DOMENICO M;PRODOCIMO MM PESTICIDE EFFECTS ON FISH CHOLINESTERASE VARIABILITY AND MEAN ACTIVITY: A META-ANALYTIC REVIEW. SCI TOTAL ENVIRON 1879-1026 757 143829 2020 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143829 FISH CHOLINESTERASES (CHES) - LIKE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) - ARE COMMON BIOMARKERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION DUE TO THEIR SENSITIVITY TO A VARIETY OF TOXICANTS. TO UNDERSTAND PESTICIDE EFFECTS ON FISH CHES MEAN ACTIVITY AND VARIABILITY, WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES. OUR GOAL WAS TO VERIFY (I) IF BRAIN AND MUSCLE CHES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; (II) HOW FISH SIZE AND LIFE STAGE (I.E., JUVENILE AND ADULT) INFLUENCE CHES VARIABILITY AND MEAN ACTIVITY; (III) WHAT TYPE OF PESTICIDES (I.E., HERBICIDE, INSECTICIDE, AND FUNGICIDE) HAS THE STRONGEST EFFECT, AND IF THE ANALYTICAL-GRADE COMPOUNDS DIFFER FROM COMMERCIAL FORMULATIONS; (IV) IF INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS COMBINED WITH PROLONGED EXPOSURE LEADS TO STRONGER CHES INHIBITION; AND (V) HOW EACH CLASS OF PESTICIDE AFFECTS THESE ENZYMES. WE VALIDATED CHES RELIABILITY AS BIOMARKERS AND IDENTIFIED FACTORS INFLUENCING THEIR RESPONSE. REGARDLESS OF TISSUE, BCHE RESPONSE WAS MORE VARIABLE THAN ACHE, AND NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR AVERAGE ACTIVITY WAS DETECTED. THE SIZE OF JUVENILE FISH IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR AFFECTING CHES MEAN ACTIVITY AND VARIABILITY, WHEREAS PESTICIDE HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ADULT FISH CHES. INSECTICIDES WERE STRONGER INHIBITORS COMPARED TO HERBICIDES AND FUNGICIDES. ANALYTICAL-GRADE COMPOUNDS DECREASED CHES MEAN ACTIVITY TO A HIGHER DEGREE THAN COMMERCIAL FORMULATIONS. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION AND TIME WAS ONLY SIGNIFICANT FOR FUNGICIDES AND INSECTICIDES. AMONG CLASSES, ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDES HAD THE STRONGEST EFFECT ON CHES, FOLLOWED BY CARBAMATES, ORGANOCHLORINES, AND PYRETHROIDS. ORGANOPHOSPHORUS HERBICIDES AND OXAZOLIDINONES WERE THE ONLY HERBICIDES TO DECREASE CHES MEAN ACTIVITY SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THEIR EFFECTS WERE SIMILAR FROM THOSE OF PYRETHROIDS AND ORGANOCHLORINES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR RESULTS IDENTIFIED RESEARCH GAPS, SUCH AS THE SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES ON FUNGICIDES, NEONICOTINOIDS AND OTHER RELEVANT PESTICIDES. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST FUTURE DIRECTIONS, WHICH MIGHT HELP RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY ROBUST CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FISH CHES AND PESTICIDES.

WHITE MALE WISTAR RATS WERE INTRAMUSCULARLY INJECTED WITH K-203, K-867 OR K-870. SERUM, BRAIN, KIDNEYS, LIVER, LUNG, EYES, AND TESTES TISSUES WERE TAKEN AFTER 5, 15, 30, 60, AND 120 MIN AND ANALYZED USING REVERSED-PHASE HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY. K-203, K-867, OR K-870 WAS PRESENT IN EVERY TISSUE THAT WAS ANALYZED, INCLUDING THE SERUM, THE EYES, TESTES, LIVER, KIDNEYS, LUNGS, AND THE BRAIN. THE SERUM LEVELS OF K-867 AND K-870 (CHLORINE-SUBSTITUTED DERIVATIVES OF K-203) WERE NEARLY CONSTANT BETWEEN 15 AND 30 MIN, WHILE THEIR PARENT COMPOUND (K-203) SHOWED PEAK LEVEL AT 15 MIN AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION OF 30 ¬µMOL/RAT. NEITHER K-203, NOR K-867 OR K-870 WERE TOXIC AT A DOSE OF 100 ¬µMOL/200 G IN RATS. CHLORINE-SUBSTITUTION OF K-867 AND K-870 PRODUCED LIMITED ABSORBANCE AND DISTRIBUTION COMPARED TO THEIR PARENT COMPOUND, K203.

Stability studies revealed that this drug is resistant to hydrolysis by human plasma (no degradation in 1h). However, it was found to undergo rapid degradation when incubated with mouse plasma or mouse liver homogenate, yielding benzyl carbamate and benzoic acid. The addition of the carboxylesterase inhibitor bis-(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) inhibited the degradation of the novel drug, indicating that it may be a substrate for both butyrylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase. The absence of carboxylesterase from human plasma explains the drug's stability in this medium. In vivo, pharmacodynamic studies on single doses of 1mg/kg to na√Øve male C57BL/6 mice revealed maximal plasma butyrylcholinesterase inhibition 20min after intraperitoneal administration (‚àº60% inhibition) and 1h after administration by gavage (‚àº45% inhibition). While this plasma butyrylcholinesterase inhibition was short-lived, the drug also penetrated the blood‚Äìbrain barrier resulting in a slight (10‚Äì15%) but persistent (‚â•72h) reduction in brain butyrylcholinesterase activity.

PHENOLIC COMPOSITION OF THE SEAWEED EXTRACTS WAS DETERMINED USING LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS SPECTROMETRY. RADICAL SCAVENGING AND METAL CHELATING ACTIVITIES WERE ASSESSED  . THE EFFECT OF THE EXTRACTS (21-84¬Äâ¬µG/ML) ON ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED USING AN   COLORIMETRIC ASSAY. TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND THIOFLAVIN-T FLUORESCENCE ASSAY WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE ANTI-AMYLOIDOGENIC ACTIVITIES OF THE EXTRACTS.   PHLOROGLUCINOL, CATECHIN, EPICATECHIN 3-GLUCOSIDE WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE EXTRACTS. ECK-AQ (IC =30.42 AND 280.47¬Äâ¬µG/ML) EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST OH  SCAVENGING AND METAL CHELATING ACTIVITIES, WHILE RED-AQ (41.23 AND 334.45¬Äâ¬µG/ML) EXHIBITED THE LOWEST. SIMILARLY, ECK-AQ (IC ¬Äâ=¬Äâ49.41 AND 52.11¬Äâ¬µG/ML) EXHIBITED HIGHER INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES, WHILE RED-AQ (64.56 AND 63.03¬Äâ¬µG/ML) SHOWED THE LEAST ACTIVITIES. RAPID FORMATION OF Œ≤-AMYLOID (AŒ≤ ) FIBRILS AND AGGREGATES WAS OBSERVED IN ELECTRON MICROGRAPHS OF THE CONTROL AFTER 72 AND 96¬ÄâH. THE REDUCTION OF AŒ≤  AGGREGATES OCCURRED AFTER CO-TREATMENT WITH THE SEAWEED EXTRACTS.   ECK-AQ, GEL-AQ, URL-AQ AND RED-AQ MAY POSSESS NEUROPROTECTIVE POTENTIAL AND COULD BE EXPLORED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

TOXICITY WAS DETERMINED ON MAMMALIAN CELLS, AND PHENOLIC PROFILING AND THE QUANTITATION OF THE MAIN METABOLITES WERE MADE BY HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO MASS SPECTROMETRY (HPLC-MS). ENZYMATIC INHIBITION WAS DETERMINED TOWARDS ACETYL- AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE, BUCHE), Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, Œ±-AMYLASE, AND TYROSINASE. DOCKING STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO TYROSINASE, ON THE MAJOR METABOLITES, AND SAMPLES WERE TESTED FOR ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES. EXTRACTS WERE NOT TOXIC, WERE CONSTITUTED MAINLY BY FLAVONOIDS, AND SOME COMPOUNDS (ROSEOSIDE AND OLEUROPEIN) ARE HERE DESCRIBED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SPECIES. THE AERIAL ORGANS' ETHANOL EXTRACT HAD RELEVANT ACTIVITY TOWARDS 2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL [DPPH, HALF MAXIMAL INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION (IC ) = 0.59 MG/ML], AND FERRIC-REDUCING ACTIVITY POWER (FRAP, IC  = 0.99 MG/ML). ALL SAMPLES WERE MORE ACTIVE TOWARDS ACHE THAN ON BUCHE. THE ETHANOL FRUITS' EXTRACT INHIBITED Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE [2.19 MMOL OF EQUIVALENT OF ACARBOSE (ACAE)/G]. SAMPLES WERE ACTIVE AGAINST TYROSINASE, ESPECIALLY THE AERIAL ORGANS' ETHANOL EXTRACTS [25.9 MG OF EQUIVALENT OF KOJIC ACID (KAE)/G].

THE ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY AND NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF THREE DIFFERENT CULTIVARS OF HARDY KIWIFRUITS, CV. MANSU (  √ó  ), CV. HAEYEON ( ), AND CV. CHIAK ( ), ON PC-12 AND SH-SY5Y CELLS WERE EVALUATED. EXTRACTION OF PHENOLICS AND VITAMIN C WAS CARRIED OUT USING 80% (V/V) AQUEOUS ETHANOL AND METAPHOSPHORIC ACID ASSISTED WITH HOMOGENIZATION, RESPECTIVELY. HARDY KIWIFRUIT OF CV. MANSU SHOWED HIGHER TOTAL PHENOLIC, TOTAL FLAVONOID, AND VITAMIN C CONTENTS AND ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY COMPARED TO THE OTHER TW¬∞CULTIVARS OF HARDY KIWIFRUITS, CV. HAEYEON AND CV. CHIAK. ANALYSIS OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY RESULTS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF PROCYANIDIN B2, (?)-EPICATECHIN, NEOCHLOROGENIC ACID, CRYPTOCHLOROGENIC ACID, RUTIN, HYPEROSIDE, ISOQUERCITRIN, AND ASTRAGALIN IN HARDY KIWIFRUITS. THE THREE CULTIVARS OF HARDY KIWIFRUITS HAD A WIDE RANGE OF VITAMIN C CONTENT OF 55.2?130.0 MG/100 G FRESH WEIGHT. ALL THREE CULTIVARS OF HARDY KIWIFRUITS HAD PROTECTIVE EFFECTS ON NEURONAL PC-12 AND SHSY5Y CELLS EXPOSED TO HYDROGEN PEROXIDE BY INCREASING CELL VIABILITY AND REDUCING INTRACELLULAR OXIDATIVE STRESS. FURTHERMORE, THE HARDY KIWIFRUITS INHIBITED ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE. COLLECTIVELY, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT HARDY KIWIFRUITS RICH IN ANTIOXIDANTS LIKE PHENOLICS AND VITAMIN C HAVE GOOD POTENTIAL AS FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS IN NEUROPROTECTIVE APPLICATIONS.

METHANOL (HAE-1), METHANOL-WATER 50:50 V/V (HAE-2) AND ETHYL ACETATE (HAE-3). THIS APPROACH ALLOWED TO PUTATIVELY ANNOTATE 291 COMPOUNDS, RECORDING MAINLY FLAVONOIDS AND PHENOLIC ACIDS. THEREAFTER, ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY, ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY AND ENZYME INHIBITION WERE ASSAYED IN THE DIFFERENT EXTRACTS. HAE-1 EXTRACT SHOWED THE HIGHEST TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT (31.84¬ÄØMG/G), FOLLOWED BY HAE-2 (26.95¬ÄØMG/G) AND HAE-3 (14.71¬ÄØMG/G). IN ADDITION, HAE-1 AND HAE-2 EXTRACTS EXHIBITED AN EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITY AGAINST BACILLUS CEREUS AND LISTERIA INNOCUA. THE HAE-2 LEAF EXTRACT WAS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGHEST DPPH AND ABTS VALUES (BEING 49.55 AND 45.26 MGTE/G), WHILE FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHER IN HAE-1 (58.26 MGTE/G). FINALLY, THE ENZYME INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF M. OLEIFERA LEAF EXTRACTS WERE INVESTIGATED AGAINST FIVE ENZYMES, NAMELY ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), TYROSINASE, Œ±-AMYLASE AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE. ALL OF THE TESTED EXTRACTS EXHIBITED INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON ACHE AND BCHE WITH A HIGHER ACTIVITY FOR HAE-3 AND HAE-1, WHILST HAE-1 SHOWED THE HIGHER IMPACT ON TYROSINASE, GLUCOSIDASE AND AMYLASE ACTIVITIES.

COMPOUND 5C, ALSO DUE TO ITS FACILE SYNTHESIS, SMALL STRUCTURE AND HIGH SELECTIVITY FOR EEACHE WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING CANDIDATE IN FORTHCOMING STUDIES. THE MAIN INTERACTING PARTS OF COMPOUND 5C AND COMPOUND 7C (MOST POTENT EEACHE AND EQBUCHE INHIBITORS RESPECTIVELY) WITH RECEPTORS WHICH CONFER SELECTIVITY FOR ACHE AND BUCHE INHIBITION WERE IDENTIFIED, DISCUSSED, AND COMPARED WITH DONEPEZIL'S INTERACTIONS. ALSO DURING MD SIMULATION IT WAS DISCOVERED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT BINDING OF SUBSTRATES LIKE DONEPEZIL TO DUAL CAS AND PAS OR SOLELY CAS REGION MIGHT HAVE A SUPPRESSIVE IMPACT ON 4-Œ±-HELICAL BUNDLES NEAR THE TRYPTOPHAN AMPHIPHILIC TETRAMERIZATION (WAT) DOMAIN OF ACHE AND RESIDUES WHICH ARE FAR AWAY FROM ACHE ACTIVE SITE. THE RESULTS PROPOSED THAT RESIDUES INVOLVED IN DONEPEZIL INTERACTIONS (TRP86 AND PHE295) WHICH ARE LOCATED IN CAS AND MID-GORGE ARE THE MEDIATOR OF CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES IN WHOLE PROTEIN STRUCTURE.

IN ADDITION, ANTIOXIDANT, CYTOTOXIC, ANTICHOLINESTERASE, UREASE, AND TYROSINASE ACTIVITIES OF ESSENTIAL OILS OBTAINED FROM NH AND NC AERIAL PARTS AND ETHANOL EXTRACTS PREPARED FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF NH AND NC WERE INVESTIGATED. THE MAJOR CONSTITUENT OF WATER-DISTILLED ESSENTIAL OILS WAS FOUND TO BE GERMACRENE D (36.7% AND 38.5%, RESPECTIVELY), AND THEIR MAIN AROMA COMPONENT WAS EUCALYPTOL (48.0% AND 24.7%, RESPECTIVELY). AMONG THE STUDIED PARTS OF NH AND NC, THEIR FLOWERS EXTRACTS WERE FOUND TO BE THE RICHEST IN PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS AND IN WHICH THE MOST ABUNDANT COMPOUND WAS ROSMARINIC ACID (8,909.91 AND 4,317.20¬†ŒºG/G, RESPECTIVELY). NH AND NC FLOWER EXTRACTS EXHIBITED ALSO STRONG ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY IN DPPH, ABTS, AND CUPRAC ASSAYS. AMONG THE TESTED SAMPLES, NH ESSENTIAL OIL INDICATED THE BEST CYTOTOXIC EFFECT AGAINST PDF, HT-29, AND MCF-7 (IC  52.34, 25.89, AND 44.70¬†ŒºG/ML, RESPECTIVELY), AND THE HIGHEST BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (77.21¬†¬±¬†1.12% INHIBITION) AND MODERATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (41.36¬†¬±¬†0.69% INHIBITION) INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT ON THE ESSENTIAL OIL AND AROMA COMPOSITIONS, THE PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, THE ANTIOXIDANT WITH TOTAL PHENOLIC AND FLAVONOID CONTENTS, CYTOTOXIC, ANTICHOLINESTERASE, UREASE, AND TYROSINASE ACTIVITIES OF NEPETA HELIOTROPIFOLIA AND N. CONGESTA SUBSP. CRYPTANTHA, EXCEPT FOR THEIR ESSENTIAL OIL COMPOSITIONS. THE REPORTED RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT NEPETA HELIOTROPIFOLIA AND N. CONGESTA SUBSP. CRYPTANTHA FLOWERS BEING RICH IN ROSMARINIC ACID AND HAVING STRONG ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL, AND NH ESSENTIAL OIL POSSESSING SIGNIFICANT CYTOTOXIC AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY EFFECT COULD BE SOURCE FOR NUTRACEUTICAL, FOOD, AND DRUG INDUSTRIES.

DC. ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND Œ±-GLYCOSIDASE ENZYMES WERE STRONGLY INHIBITED BY THE L. CRETICA EXTRACTS. IC  VALUES FOR THE THREE ENZYMES WERE FOUND AS 3.21¬ÄÖMG/ML, 2.1¬ÄÖMG/ML, AND 2.07¬ÄÖMG/ML, RESPECTIVELY. ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES WERE EXAMINED IN BOTH AQUEOUS AND ETHANOL (ETOH) EXTRACTS USING CUPRAC, FRAP, AND DPPH METHOD. ALSO, THE PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS OF THE ENDEMIC PLANT WERE IDENTIFIED AND QUANTIFIED BY USING HPLC/MS/MS. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, THE EXTRACTS HAVE REMARKABLE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES. THE MOST ABUNDANT PHENOLIC ACIDS OF L. CRETICA IN ETOH EXTRACT WERE DETERMINED AS QUINIC ACID (12.76¬ÄÖMG/KG OF CRUDE EXTRACT), CHLOROGENIC ACID (3.39¬ÄÖMG/KG), AND MALIC ACID (2.38¬ÄÖMG/KG).

J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 43 E12776 2018 10.1111/jfbc.12776 MANY TAXA OF SALVIA GENUS HAVE BEEN USED IN HERBAL BEVERAGES, FOOD FLAVORING, COSMETICS, AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. IN THIS PAPER, CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OF SALVIA ERIOPHORA (S. ERIOPHORA) LEAVES WERE DETERMINED BY LC-MS/MS (LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY). SALVIGENIN (158.64¬†¬±¬†10.8¬†MG/KG), FUMARIC ACID (123.09¬†¬±¬†8.54¬†MG/KG), AND QUERCETAGETIN-3.6-DIMETHYLETHER (37.85¬†¬±¬†7.09¬†MG/KG) WERE DETECTED AS MAJOR COMPOUNDS IN THE ETHANOL EXTRACT, WHEREAS FUMARIC ACID (555.96¬†¬±¬†38.56¬†MG/KG), CAFFEIC ACID (103.62¬†¬±¬†20.51¬†MG/KG), AND EPICATECHIN (83.19¬†¬±¬†8.43¬†MG/KG) WERE DETECTED AS MAJOR COMPOUNDS IN THE WATER EXTRACT. FURTHERMORE, ENZYME INHIBITION OF S. ERIOPHORA AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), Œ±-AMYLASE (AM), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND Œ±-GLYCOSIDASE (AG) ENZYMES WERE DETECTED. ACHE, BCHE, AG, AND AM ENZYMES WERE VERY STRONGLY INHIBITED BY S. ERIOPHORA WATER EXTRACT (WES) AND S. ERIOPHORA METHANOL EXTRACT (MES). ADDITIONALLY, ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF S. ERIOPHORA WAS DETERMINED BY IN VITRO ANALYTICAL METHODS. IC  VALUES OF WES AND MES WERE PERFORMED FOR RADICALS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: METABOLIC ENZYMES HAVE CRUCIAL FUNCTIONS ON LIVING SYSTEMS DUE TO INHIBITION OR ACTIVATION OF THEM MAINLY ATTRIBUTED WITH SOME HEALTH DISORDERS. ACHE, BCHE, AM, AND AG ENZYMES HAVE IMPORTANT ROLES ON CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM OR CHOLINERGIC PATHWAYS. THE RELATION BETWEEN ENZYME INHIBITION EFFECT AND PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS OR ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY NEED TO BE CONFIRMED. THUS, MANY STUDIES TESTED TO CLARIFY THIS RELATION FOR PURE SAMPLES OR PLANT EXTRACTS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT ABOUT INHIBITION EFFECTS OF SALVIA ERIOPHORA EXTRACTS AGAINST ACHE, BCHE, AM, AND AG ENZYMES AS WELL AS THEIR PHENOLIC CONTENTS AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES.

J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 43 E13078 2019 10.1111/jfbc.13078 IN THIS STUDY, UREASE, TYROSINASE, CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY, AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES OF VARIOUS EXTRACTS OF SIDERITIS ALBIFLORA AND SIDERITIS LEPTOCLADA WERE DETERMINED TOGETHER WITH THE PHYTOCHEMICAL CONTENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FATTY ACID COMPOSITIONS AND PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS WERE INVESTIGATED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY¬†(GC), GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY¬†(GC-MS), AND HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-DIODE ARRAY DETECTOR (HPLC-DAD). ROSMARINIC ACID AND CAFFEIC ACID IN BOTH SIDERITIS SPECIES WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST ABUNDANT PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS WHEREAS PALMITIC ACID WAS FOUND AS A MAJOR FATTY ACID. THE ACETONE EXTRACT OF S. LEPTOCLADA INDICATED THE HIGHEST ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY IN Œ≤-CAROTENE-LINOLEIC ACID (IC  : 17.23¬†¬±¬†0.11¬†¬µG/ML), DPPH  (IC  : 28.14¬†¬±¬†0.05¬†¬µG/ML) AND ABTS  (IC  : 15.18¬†¬±¬†0.02¬†¬µG/ML) ASSAYS. THE ACETONE EXTRACT OF S. ALBIFLORA (A  : 32.71¬†¬±¬†0.44¬†¬µG/ML) WAS FOUND AS THE BEST REDUCTANT IN CUPRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY¬†(CUPRAC) ASSAY. AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE)¬†AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE¬†(BCHE), ONLY THE HEXANE EXTRACTS OF SIDERITIS SPECIES SHOWED MODERATE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, ALL EXTRACTS OF S. ALBIFLORA AND THE HEXANE EXTRACT OF S. LEPTOCLADA EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UREASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY THAN THAT OF THIOUREA. FURTHER, IN VIVO ACTIVITY STUDIES ON EXTRACTS AND ISOLATED CONSTITUENTS OBTAINED FROM THESE SPECIES ARE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTIVITY IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: MULTIPLE PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT SIDERITIS SPECIES IS PRECIOUS WITH SIGNIFICANT BIOACTIVE PROPERTIES. THIS IS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH TO DETERMINE THE ENZYME INHIBITORY AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES OF VARIOUS EXTRACTS OF S. ALBIFLORA AND S. LEPTOCLADA WITH PHYTOCHEMICAL CONTENTS. BOTH SIDERITIS SPECIES WERE FOUND TO BE RICH IN ROSMARINIC AND CAFFEIC ACIDS. THE ACETONE EXTRACTS SHOWED THE HIGHEST ACTIVITY IN TERMS OF ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY, WHILE THE HEXANE EXTRACTS EXHIBITED SUPERIOR UREASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SIDERITIS SPECIES COULD BE USED AS UREASE INHIBITORS' AGENTS AND SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS IN FOOD, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES.

The anti-inflammatory activity was determined by the carrageenan-induced paw edema assay in rats. Total flavonoids and phenols and total pigment contents were also investigated. The highest flavonoid contents were found in the methanolic extracts of P. harmala and the highest phenol content in the methanolic extract of R. raetama. The highest concentration of chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids were found in the leaves of P. harmala. The methanol extract of Marrubium alysson showed the best inhibitory activity against BChE (72.5¬±2.07%) whereas the methanol extract of Peganum harmala had a moderate inhibitory effect (50.53¬±1.98%) at the same concentration of 1mg/ml. Methanol extracts of M. alysson and P. harmala had the highest anti-inflammatory activity.

NUTR NEUROSCI 1476-8305 NA 1-17 2020 10.1080/1028415X.2020.1764290 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) IS AN ACQUIRED NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER OF COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENTS, WITH A LONG AND PROGRESSIVE ROUTE. CURRENTLY, EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO DEVELOP POTENT DRUGS THAT TARGET MULTIPLE PATHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT DRIVE THE SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF AD IN HUMAN BEINGS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NANO-DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS HAS RECENTLY EMERGED AS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO TREAT AD. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF PHYTOL AND PHYTOL LOADED POLY LACTIC-CO-GLYCOLIC ACID NANOPARTICLES (PHYTOL-PLGANPS) WERE EVALUATED IN WISTAR RAT SCOPOLAMINE MODEL OF AD. THE CONSUMPTION OF PHYTOL AND PHYTOL-PLGANPS SIGNIFICANTLY AMELIORATED THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS CAUSED BY SCOPOLAMINE ON SPATIAL AND SHORT TERM MEMORY. PHYTOL AND PHYTOL-PLGANPS SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE CHOLINERGIC EFFECT BY INHIBITING BOTH ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE & BUCHE), Œ≤-SECRETASE 1 (BACE1) ACTIVITY, ATTENUATING MACROMOLECULAR DAMAGE, REDUCING REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) AND REACTIVE NITROGEN SPECIES (RNS) LEVEL BY ACTIVATING ANTIOXIDATIVE DEFENSE SYSTEM (SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE AND CATALASE) AND RESTORING GLUTATHIONE METABOLIZING ENZYME SYSTEMS (GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE) AND ALSO REGULATING THE APOPTOTIC MEDIATED CELL DEATH. MOREOVER,   TOXICITY STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PHYTOL AND PHYTOL-PLGANPS DID NOT CAUSE ANY ADVERSE PATHOLOGICAL ALTERATION IN RATS TREATED WITH A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF PHYTOL-PLGANPS (200¬ÄÖMG/KG). PHARMACOKINETIC STUDY REVEALED THAT PHYTOL-PLGANPS ENHANCED THE BIODISTRIBUTION AND SUSTAINED THE RELEASE PROFILE OF PHYTOL IN THE BRAIN AND PLASMA. OVERALL, THE OUTCOME OF THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PHYTOL AND PHYTOL-PLGANPS ACT AS A POTENT CANDIDATE WITH BETTER ANTI-AMNESIC EFFECTS AND MULTI-FACETED NEUROPROTECTIVE POTENTIAL AGAINST SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED MEMORY DYSFUNCTION IN WISTAR RATS.

CHILDREN WITH SAM ARE TREATED SIMILARLY REGARDLESS OF HIV STATUS, ALTHOUGH MECHANISMS OF NUTRITIONAL RECOVERY IN HIV AND/OR SAM ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. WE PERFORMED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A CLINICAL TRIAL AND PLASMA PROTEOMICS DATA AMONG CHILDREN WITH COMPLICATED SAM IN KENYA AND MALAWI. COMPARED TO CHILDREN WITH SAM WITHOUT HIV (N¬Äâ=¬Äâ113), HIV-INFECTED CHILDREN (N¬Äâ=¬Äâ54) HAD EVIDENCE (FALSE DISCOVERY RATE (FDR) CORRECTED P¬Äâ<¬Äâ0.05) OF METABOLIC STRESS, INCLUDING ENRICHED PATHWAYS RELATED TO INFLAMMATION AND LIPID METABOLISM. MOREOVER, WE OBSERVED REDUCED PLASMA LEVELS OF ZINC-Œ±-2-GLYCOPROTEIN, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF COMPLEMENT C2 RESEMBLING FINDINGS IN METABOLIC SYNDROME, DIABETES AND OTHER NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. HIV WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED (FDR CORRECTED P¬Äâ<¬Äâ0.05) WITH HIGHER PLASMA LEVELS OF INFLAMMATORY CHEMOKINES. CONSIDERING EVIDENCE OF BIOMARKERS OF METABOLIC STRESS, IT IS OF POTENTIAL CONCERN THAT OUR CURRENT TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR SAM REGARDLESS OF HIV STATUS INVOLVES A HIGH-FAT THERAPEUTIC DIET. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST A NEED FOR CLINICAL TRIALS OF THERAPEUTIC FOODS THAT MEET THE SPECIFIC METABOLIC NEEDS OF CHILDREN WITH HIV AND SAM.

As a result of complexity of AD, no molecule has been approved since 2002. Idalopirdine, a 5-HT6 receptors antagonist, did not show its effectiveness in clinical trial despite its evaluation as adjunct to cholinesterase inhibitors. Pleiotropic molecules, known as multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are currently developed to tackle the multifactorial origin of AD. In this context, we have developed a pleiotropic carbamate 7, that behaves as a covalent inhibitor of BuChE (IC50¬ =¬ 0.97¬ ŒºM). The latter will deliver after hydrolysis, compound 6, a potent 5-HT6 receptors antagonist (Ki¬ =¬ 11.4¬ nM) related to idalopirdine. In silico and in¬ vitro evaluation proving our concept were performed completed with first in¬ vivo results that demonstrate great promise in restoring working memory.

HOWEVER, SUITABLE BEDSIDE BIOMARKERS TO EVALUATE THE EMERGING INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE FOLLOWING BURN INJURIES ARE MISSING. SERUM CHOLINESTERASE (BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, BCHE) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A CLINICALLY RELEVANT BIOMARKER IN ACUTE INFLAMMATORY DISEASES INCLUDING BURNS. IN THIS OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY BCHE ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED BY USING POINT-OF-CARE TESTING (POCT), A NOVEL METHOD IN ACUTE BURN CARE. POCT MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED AT EMERGENCY ROOM ADMISSION (ERA) OF 35 PATIENTS AND REPEATED 12, 24 AND 48 H LATER. ALL PATIENTS OR THEIR LEGAL DESIGNEES GAVE INFORMED CONSENT. PATIENTS WITH BURN INJURIES SHOWED SUSTAINED BCHE ACTIVITY REDUCTION FOLLOWING HOSPITAL ADMISSION. BCHE ACTIVITY CORRELATED NEGATIVELY WITH BURN INJURY SEVERITY, ORGAN FAILURE SEVERITY AND INTENSIVE CARE UNIT RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS. BCHE ACTIVITY MEASURED AT ERA AND 12 H LATER IDENTIFIED SURVIVORS AND PREDICTED 28-DAY PATIENT OUTCOME WITH NONINFERIOR EFFICACY COMPARED TO THE ABBREVIATED BURN SEVERITY INDEX (ABSI) SCORING. FINALLY, POCT-MEASURED BCHE ACTIVITY MIGHT COMPLEMENT ABSI SCORING AND POSSIBLY IMPROVE EARLY RISK STRATIFICATION IN ACUTE BURN CARE THERAPY.

ALTHOUGH THE ETIOLOGY OF MS IS STILL UNKNOWN, BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF THE DISEASE. ACETYLCHOLINE PARTICIPATES IN THE MODULATION OF CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION. THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, AS WELL AS MICROGLIA, ASTROCYTES AND OLIGODENDROCYTES EXPRESS CHOLINERGIC MARKERS AND RECEPTORS OF MUSCARINIC AND NICOTINIC TYPE. THE ROLE PLAYED BY ACETYLCHOLINE IN MS HAS BEEN RECENTLY INVESTIGATED. IN THE PRESENT REVIEW, WE SUMMARIZE THE EVIDENCE INDICATING THE CHOLINERGIC DYSFUNCTION IN SERUM AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID OF RELAPSING-REMITTING (RR)-MS PATIENTS AND IN THE BRAINS OF THE MS ANIMAL MODEL EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS (EAE). THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE INCREASED ACTIVITY OF THE CHOLINERGIC HYDROLYZING ENZYMES ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, THE REDUCED LEVELS OF ACETYLCHOLINE AND THE INCREASE OF PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES PRODUCTION WERE RECENTLY DESCRIBED IN IMMUNE CELLS OF MS PATIENTS. MOREOVER, THE GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS FOR BOTH HYDROLYZING ENZYMES AND THE POSSIBLE CORRELATION WITH THE ALTERED LEVELS OF THEIR ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY HAVE BEEN ALSO REPORTED.

THE AIM OF THIS WORK WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER CHRONIC MATERNAL OP EXPOSURE EXACERBATES METABOLIC DYSFUNCTIONS IN EARLY-OVERFED RATS. DURING PREGNANCY AND LACTATIONAL PERIODS, DAMS RECEIVED OP BY GAVAGE. TO INDUCE NEONATAL OVERNUTRITION AT POSTNATAL DAY 3, PUPS WERE STANDARDIZED TO 9 OR 3 PER NEST. AT 90-DAYS-OLD, GLUCOSE-INSULIN HOMEOSTASIS AND INSULIN RELEASE FROM PANCREATIC ISLETS WERE ANALYZED. WHILE BOTH OP EXPOSURE AND OVERFEEDING ALONE DID INDUCE DIABETOGENIC PHENOTYPES IN ADULTHOOD, THERE WAS NO EXACERBATION IN RATS THAT EXPERIENCED BOTH. UNEXPECTEDLY, THE GROUP THAT EXPERIENCED BOTH HAD IMPROVED ADIPOSITY, METABOLIC PARAMETERS, ATTENUATED INSULIN RELEASE FROM ISOLATED ISLETS IN THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE AND LOW FUNCTION OF MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR M3, AS WELL AS AN ATTENUATION OF BETA CELL MASS HYPERPLASIA. HIGH LEVELS OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND LOW LEVELS OF INSULIN IN MILK MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE OP-INDUCED DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMING. OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT MATERNAL OP EXPOSURE MAY PROGRAM INSULIN RELEASE AS WELL AS ENDOCRINE PANCREAS STRUCTURE, THUS AFFECTING METABOLISM IN ADULTHOOD. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT WHILE PERINATAL OP EXPOSURE ALONE INCREASES THE RISK FOR LATER LIFE T2D, IT ACTUALLY REVERSES MANY OF THE PROGRAMMED METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION THAT IS INDUCED BY POSTNATAL OVERFEEDING. THESE SURPRISING RESULTS MAY SUGGEST THAT LOW-DOSE ADMINISTRATION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS COULD BE OF UTILITY IN PREVENTING DETRIMENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMING THAT IS CAUSED BY EARLY-LIFE OVERNUTRITION.

CURRENT THERAPEUTICS USED TO TREAT ALZHEIMER DISEASE ELICIT BROAD ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS, AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS (CHEIS) ARE REQUIRED. HEREIN, WE SCREENED METHANOLIC EXTRACTS FROM SEVEN COMMONLY CULTIVATED PLANTS FOR THEIR NUTRACEUTICAL POTENTIAL; ABILITY TO INHIBIT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYL-CHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), AND PROVISION OF ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY THROUGH THEIR 2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYL-HYDRAZYL-HYDRATE (DPPH) FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING CAPABILITIES. POTENTIAL NEUROTOXICITY OF PLANT EXTRACTS WAS EXAMINED VIA APPLICATION TO SHSY-5Y NEUROBLASTOMA CELLS AND QUANTITATION OF CELL VIABILITY. METHANOLIC EXTRACTS OF   (LEMON),   (RED SILK-COTTON),   (HENNA),   (EUCALYPTUS),   (BASIL),   (MANDARIN ORANGE), AND   (SPEARMINT) ALL DISPLAYED CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT INHIBITION OF ACHE AND BUCHE. THE MAJORITY OF EXTRACTS INHIBITED ACHE AND BUCHE TO NEAR EQUIPOTENCY, WITH HENNA AND EUCALYPTUS EXTRACTS THE TWO MOST POTENT CHEIS. ALL PLANT EXTRACTS WERE ABLE TO SCAVENGE FREE RADICALS IN A CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT MANNER, WITH EUCALYPTUS THE MOST POTENT ANTIOXIDANT. TOXICITY OF PLANT EXTRACTS TO NEURONAL CELLS WAS CONCENTRATION DEPENDENT, WITH EUCALYPTUS ALSO THE MOST TOXIC EXTRACT. FRACTIONATION OF PLANT EXTRACTS AND ANALYSIS BY MASS SPECTROMETRY IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF PLANT POLYPHENOLS THAT MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION: 3-CAFFEOYLQUINIC ACID, METHYL 4-CAFFEOYLQUINATE, KAEMPFEROL-ACETYL-GLYCOSIDE, QUERCETIN 3-RUTINOSIDE, QUERCETIN-ACETYL-GLYCOSIDE, KAEMPFEROL 3- -GLUCOSIDE, AND QUERCETIN 3- -GLUCOSIDE. IN SILICO MOLECULAR MODELING OF THESE POLYPHENOLS DEMONSTRATED THEIR IMPROVED ACHE AND BUCHE BINDING AFFINITIES COMPARED TO THE CURRENT FDA-APPROVED DUAL CHEI, GALANTAMINE. COLLECTIVELY, ALL THE PLANT EXTRACTS CONTAINED NUTRACEUTICAL AGENTS AS ANTIOXIDANTS AND CHEIS AND, THEREFORE, THEIR CHRONIC CONSUMPTION MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL TO COMBAT THE PATHOLOGICAL DEFICITS THAT ACCRUE IN ALZHEIMER DISEASE.

BASIC CLIN PHARMACOL TOXICOL 1742-7843 126 399-410 2019 10.1111/bcpt.13359 THE INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) IS A COMMON OUTCOME CAUSED BY ORGANOPHOSPHORUS (OPS) INTOXICATION. ALTHOUGH INCONSISTENT, THE STANDARD TREATMENT CONSISTS OF A MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST (ATROPINE) AND ACHE-REACTIVATING MOLECULES SUCH AS OXIMES. THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO TEST UNPUBLISHED COMPOUNDS WHICH CONTAIN THE MOIETIES OF ISATIN AND/OR OXIME HAVE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS AGAINST THE TOXICITY INDUCED BY MALATHION IN TWO ANIMAL MODELS: ARTEMIA SALINA AND RATTUS NORVEGICUS (WISTAR RATS). THE LETHALITY WAS ASSESSED IN A¬†SALINA, AND THE CALCULATED LD  TO (3Z)-5-CHLORO-3-(HYDROXYIMINO) INDOLIN-2-ONE OXIME (C¬Ñì-HIN) AND 2-(5-CHLORO-2-OXOINDOLIN-3-YLIDENE)-HYDRAZINECARBOTHIOAMIDE (C¬Ñì-OXHS) WAS HIGHER THAN 1000¬†¬µM WHILE TO 3-(PHENYLHYDRAZONO) BUTAN-2-ONE OXIME (PHBO) WAS 38¬†¬µM. OUR SCREENING SHOWED THAT C¬Ñì-HIN SEEMS TO BE THE MOST PROMISING MOLECULE, WITH LOW TOXICITY TO A¬†SALINA, PROTECTION AGAINST MORTALITY (WITH OR WITHOUT ATROPINE) AND ACHE INHIBITION INDUCED BY MALATHION. SIMILARLY, THE ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF 300¬†MG/KG OF C¬Ñì-HIN INDUCED LOW OR NO TOXICITY IN RATS. THE PLASMA BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND CORTICAL ACHE ACTIVITIES WERE REACTIVATED BY C¬Ñì-HIN (50¬†MG/KG, P.O.) IN RATS EXPOSED TO MALATHION (250¬†MG/KG, I.P). NO DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN PARAOXONASE-1 (PON-1) ACTIVITY AMONG GROUPS TREATED. IN CONCLUSION, C¬Ñì-HIN RESTORED THE CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES INHIBITED BY MALATHION IN A¬†SALINA AND RATS WITH LOW TOXICITY IN BOTH. THUS, THE DATA PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT C¬Ñì-HIN, A COMPOUND THAT COMBINES ISATIN AND OXIME FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, IS SAFE AND HAS IMPORTANT PROPERTIES TO REACTIVATE THE CHOLINESTERASES INHIBITED BY MALATHION. IN ADDITION, WE DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT IN AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE USE OF MAMMALIANS IN DRUG DISCOVERY.

AMONG SEVERAL DRUGS, WE DESIGNED THE DEVICE FOR EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF COMPOUNDS (E.G. PHYSOSTIGMINE, RIVASTIGMINE, DONEPEZIL) WHICH ARE ABLE TO INHIBIT IN A REVERSIBLE WAY THE CHOLINESTERASE ENZYME. BECAUSE CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY IS PECULIAR TO EACH PATIENT, THE ADMINISTRATION OF CUSTOMIZED AMOUNT OF THE DRUG CAN IMPROVE THE TREATMENT EFFICACY AND THE QUALITY OF PATIENT LIFE, AVOIDING SIDE EFFECTS DUE TO THE OVERDOSAGE. IN DETAIL, WE EXPLOITED VIVID¬Ñ¢ PLASMA SEPARATION MEMBRANE TO THREAT THE WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLE, FILTER PAPER TO LOAD THE REAGENTS NEEDED FOR THE MEASUREMENT, AND OFFICE PAPER TO PRINT ELECTRODES ABLE TO MEASURE THE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY, DELIVERING A REAGENT FREE ANALYTICAL TOOL. THE CALIBRATION CURVE OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE OBTAINED IN BLOOD SAMPLE PROVIDED LINEARITY BETWEEN 2 AND 12 U/ML, WITH SENSITIVITY OF 0.050¬†¬±¬†0.004¬†ŒºA¬†ML/U. THE PHYSOSTIGMINE, RIVASTIGMINE, AND DONEPEZIL INHIBITION ACTIVITIES TOWARD THE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ENZYME WERE ALSO MEASURED IN BLOOD SAMPLE WITH LINEARITY UP TO RESPECTIVELY 0.5¬†ŒºM, 25¬†ŒºM, 30¬†ŒºM, AND DETECTION LIMITS OF 0.009¬†ŒºM, 0.4¬†ŒºM, 0.3¬†ŒºM.

J FOOD BIOCHEM 1745-4514 43 E12908 2019 10.1111/jfbc.12908 THE PHENOLIC CONTENTS AND ANTIOXIDANT, ANTICANCER, ANTIDIABETIC, AND ANTICHOLINERGIC POTENTIALS OF FOUR ENDEMIC GYSOPHILA TAXA (G. PALLIDA, G. ARROSTI, G. TUBERCULOSA, AND G. ERIOCALYX) WERE INVESTIGATED. THE HPLC ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT METHANOL EXTRACTS OF ALL THE TESTED SPECIES WERE RICHER IN PHENOLICS THAN WATER EXTRACTS. 3,4-DIHYDROXYBENZOIC ACID, P-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID, VANILLIN, SYRINGIC ACID, AND P-COUMARIC ACID WERE DETECTED IN ALL EXTRACTS. IN PARALLEL TO THE PHENOLIC CONTENTS, METHANOL EXTRACTS DISPLAYED COMPARATIVELY HIGHER ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY THAN WATER EXTRACTS. ADDITIONALLY, ALL EXTRACTS EXHIBITED DOSE-DEPENDENT ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY ON THE CANCER CELL LINES WITH LOWER IC  VALUES CHANGING FROM 0.170 TO 1.805¬†MG/ML. MOREOVER, THE EXTRACTS IMPRESSIVELY INHIBITED THE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (0.63-26.04), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (3.66-10.73), AND Œ±-GLYCOSIDASE (98.52-235.55) ENZYMES WITH VERY LOW IC  (MG/ML) VALUES. TOGETHER, THE PRESENT RESULTS INDICATE THAT GYSOPHILA TAXA HAVE VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES TOGETHER WITH HIGHER PHENOLIC CONTENTS. HENCE, THESE SPECIES HOLD GOOD POTENTIAL FOR USE IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: GYPSOPHILA TAXA HAVING NUMEROUS BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN USED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSE IN FOLK MEDICINE AS WELL AS THEIR USE IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY. THE OBTAINED RESULTS OF THE CURRENT STUDY INDICATED THAT THE EXTRACTS OF GYPSOPHILA TAXA ARE RICH IN PHENOLICS AND FLAVONOIDS WITH POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY AGAINST DIFFERENT TYPE OF CANCER CELL LINES. IN ADDITION, THE EXTRACTS OBTAINED FROM THESE TAXA SHOWED NOTABLE ANTIDIABETIC AND ANTICHOLINERGICS EFFECTS. GYPSOPHILA TAXA COULD BE USED AS A NATURAL MATERIAL TO DEVELOP ANTICANCER, ANTIDIABETIC, AND ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUGS.

THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF SIMPLE STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION OF Œ±-MANGOSTIN ON ITS CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AND TOXICITY TOWARD NEUROBLASTOMA AND LIVER CANCER CELLS. THE DIALKYLATED DERIVATIVES RETAINED GOOD ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES WITH IC  VALUES BETWEEN 4.15 AND 6.73¬Äâ¬µM, BUT NOT BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES, COMPARED WITH Œ±-MANGOSTIN, A DUAL INHIBITOR (IC  : ACHE, 2.48¬Äâ¬µM; BCHE, 5.87¬Äâ¬µM). DIALKYLATION OF Œ±-MANGOSTIN PRODUCED ACHE SELECTIVE INHIBITORS THAT FORMED HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS AT THE ACTIVE SITE OF ACHE. INTERESTINGLY, ALL FOUR DIALKYLATED DERIVATIVES OF Œ±-MANGOSTIN SHOWED MUCH LOWER CYTOTOXICITY, BEING 6.4- TO 9.0-FOLD AND 3.8- TO 5.5-FOLD LESS TOXIC THAN THEIR PARENT COMPOUND ON NEUROBLASTOMA AND LIVER CANCER CELLS, RESPECTIVELY. LIKEWISE, THEIR SELECTIVITY INDEX WAS HIGHER BY 1.9- TO 4.4-FOLD; IN PARTICULAR, A2 AND A4 SHOWED IMPROVED SELECTIVITY INDEX COMPARED WITH Œ±-MANGOSTIN. TAKEN TOGETHER, MODIFICATION OF THE HYDROXYL GROUPS OF Œ±-MANGOSTIN AT POSITIONS C-3 AND C-6 GREATLY INFLUENCED ITS BCHE INHIBITORY AND CYTOTOXIC BUT NOT ITS ACHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES. THESE DIALKYLATED DERIVATIVES ARE VIABLE CANDIDATES FOR FURTHER STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION AND REFINEMENT, WORTHY IN THE SEARCH OF NEW ACHE INHIBITORS WITH HIGHER SAFETY MARGINS.

THE STUDIES ON SCALING-UP TO PILOT-SCALE BIOREACTORS, ESPECIALLY IN CONVENTIONAL STAINLESS-STEEL STIRRED TANK BIOREACTORS (STB), TO PRODUCE RECOMBINANT PROTEINS IN PLANT CELL SUSPENSION CULTURES ARE VERY LIMITED. IN THIS STUDY, WE SCALED-UP THE PRODUCTION OF RICE RECOMBINANT BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (RRBCHE), A COMPLEX HYDROLASE ENZYME THAT CAN BE USED TO PROPHYLACTICALLY AND THERAPEUTICALLY TREAT AGAINST ORGANOPHOSPHORUS NERVE AGENTS AND PESTICIDE EXPOSURE, FROM METABOLICALLY REGULATED TRANSGENIC RICE CELL SUSPENSION CULTURES IN A 40-L PILOT-SCALE STB. EMPLOYING CYCLICAL OPERATION TOGETHER WITH A SIMPLIFIED-PROCESS OPERATION (CONTROLLING GAS SPARGING RATE RATHER THAN DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND ALLOWING NATURAL SUGAR DEPLETION) IDENTIFIED IN LAB-SCALE (5¬ÄâL) BIOREACTOR STUDIES, WE FOUND A CONSISTENT MAXIMUM TOTAL ACTIVE RRBCHE PRODUCTION LEVEL OF 46-58¬Äâ¬µG/G FRESH WEIGHT IN FOUR CYCLES OVER 82 DAYS OF SEMICONTINUOUS OPERATION. ADDITIONALLY, MAINTAINING THE OVERALL VOLUMETRIC OXYGEN MASS TRANSFER COEFFICIENT (K  A) IN THE PILOT-SCALE STB TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE LAB-SCALE STB IMPROVES THE MAXIMUM TOTAL ACTIVE RRBCHE PRODUCTION LEVEL AND THE MAXIMUM VOLUMETRIC PRODUCTIVITY TO 85¬Äâ¬µG/G FRESH WEIGHT AND 387¬Äâ¬µG¬ÄâL  ¬ÄâDAY  , RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE COMPARABLE TO THE LAB-SCALE CULTURE.

NON-HUMAN PRIMATES ARE SUITABLE MODELS FOR TOXICITY STUDIES THAT CANNOT BE PERFORMED IN HUMANS. WE EVALUATED THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF NATIVE MACAQUE (MABCHE) TETRAMERS, COMPARED TO RECOMBINANT MABCHE MONOMERS, PEGYLATED RECOMBINANT MABCHE TETRAMERS AND MONOMERS, AND NATIVE HUBCHE TETRAMERS. K  AND K  VALUES FOR BUTYRYLTHIOCHOLINE WERE INDEPENDENT OF SUBUNIT ASSEMBLY STATUS. THE K  FOR ALL FORMS OF MABCHE WAS ABOUT 70¬†ŒºM, COMPARED TO 13¬†ŒºM FOR HUBCHE. THE K  WAS ABOUT 100,000 MIN  FOR MABCHE AND 30,000 MIN  FOR HUBCHE. THE REVERSIBLE INHIBITOR ETHOPROPAZINE HAD SIMILAR K  VALUES OF 0.05¬†ŒºM FOR ALL MABCHE FORMS AND HUBCHE.

A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MABCHE AND HUBCHE WAS THE RATE OF REACTIVATION BY 2-PAM. THE SECOND ORDER RATE CONSTANT FOR REACTIVATION OF DFP-INHIBITED MABCHE BY 2-PAM WAS 1.4¬†M ¬†MIN , BUT WAS 380 FOLD FASTER FOR DFP-INHIBITED HUBCHE (K  531¬†M ¬†MIN ). THE ACYL POCKET OF MABCHE HAS LEU285 IN PLACE OF PRO285 IN HUBCHE. THE REACTIVATION RATE OF DFP-INHIBITED HUBCHE MUTANT P285L BY 2-PAM WAS REDUCED 5.8-FOLD (K  92¬†M ¬†MIN ) INDICATING THAT P285 DETERMINES WHETHER 2-PAM BINDS IN AN ORIENTATION THAT FAVORS RELEASE OF DIISOPROPYLPHOSPHATE. DFP-INHIBITED MABCHE TREATED WITH 0.2¬†M 2-PAM RECOVERED 10% OF ITS ORIGINAL ACTIVITY, WHEREAS DFP-INHIBITED HUBCHE RECOVERED 80% ACTIVITY.

The supply of plasma-derived butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) is constrained by the availability of human blood and a complex purification process and its high cost. This constraints necessitates the development of expression platforms capable of large-scale, low-cost production of an active recombinant BChE (rBChE). Traditionally, procainamide affinity chromatography has been used to purify BChE. Recently, an effective affinity chromatography resin based on a potent cholinesterase inhibitor (tacrine-huperzine A hybrid; huperine X termed as Hupresin¬Æ) was developed. Here, we describe a purification scheme of rBChE from Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Different extraction buffers were screened for their ability to extract rBChE and native plant proteins. Citrate buffer at pH 4 was selected to minimize extraction of host plant proteins and showed a 4.5-fold enhancement in rBChE specific activity compared to Tris buffer, pH 8. DEAE-Sepharose chromatography increased the purity of rBChE by 70% by removing major host plant protein impurities. The rBChE was then adsorbed to Hupresin¬Æ and purified to homogeneity for an overall process yield of 34%. The purification process represents a threefold higher product yield over the established process. Mass spectrometry confirmed the protein sequence and site-specific N-glycosylation analysis was performed.

The procainamide affinity gel has limitations. In the present report a new affinity gel called Hupresin¬Æ was evaluated for its ability to purify truncated, recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (rHuBChE) expressed in a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line. We present a detailed example of the purification of rHuBChE secreted into 3940‚ÄØmL of serum-free culture medium. The starting material contained 13,163‚ÄØunits of BChE activity (20.9‚ÄØmg). rHuBChE was purified to homogeneity in a single step by passage over 82‚ÄØmL of Hupresin¬Æ eluted with 0.1‚ÄØM tetramethylammonium bromide in 20‚ÄØmM TrisCl pH‚ÄØ7.5. The fraction with the highest specific activity of 630‚ÄØunits/mg contained 11‚ÄØmg of BChE. Hupresin¬Æ is superior to procainamide-Sepharose for purification of BChE, but is not suitable for purifying native AChE because Hupresin¬Æ binds AChE so tightly that AChE is not released with buffers, but is desorbed with denaturing solvents such as 50% acetonitrile or 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Procainamide-Sepharose will continue to be useful for purification of AChE.

Either level of this enzyme ‚Äì increased or otherwise ‚Äì can indicate disease or intoxication. The most popular technique to assess the cholinesterase activity is the detection of thiocholine, a product of enzymatic hydrolysis of butyrylthiocholine. In this work, Ag-paste was used as SERS-substrate and a new technique was created for thiocholine detection. As explained below, the designed technique facilitates also determination of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity both in the buffer and in spike solution with human plasma. Ellman‚Äôs assay was used as a reference method, a good correlation between spectrophotometric detection and Raman detection was shown.

Selective butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors (BuChEIs) may be more effective treatments in late-stage Alzheimer‚Äôs disease with fewer side effects. Virtual screening is a powerful tool for identifying potential inhibitors in large digital compound databases. This study used structure-based virtual screening combined with physicochemical filtering to screen the InterBioScreen and Maybridge databases for novel selective BuChEIs. The workflow rapidly identified 22 potential hits in silico, resulting in the discovery of a human BuChEI with low-micromolar potency in vitro (IC50 2.4¬ ¬µM) and high selectivity for butyrylcholinesterase over acetylcholinesterase. The compound was a rapidly reversible BuChEI with mixed-model in vitro inhibition kinetics. The binding interactions were investigated using in silico molecular dynamics and by developing structure-activity relationships using nine analogues. The compound also displayed high permeability in an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier.

Upon the addition of BChE, CyClCP could be efficiently activated with remarkable NIR (Œªem¬ =¬ 708¬ nm) fluorescence enhancement and obvious absorbance red shift (581¬ nm‚Äì687¬ nm). Specifically, according to the subtle differences structural features and substrate preference between BChE and its sister enzyme AChE, CyClCP was constructed by introducing chlorine atom at the ortho-position of the phenolic hydroxyl in the previous reported probe (CyCP). Fortunately, CyClCP exhibited better selectivity towards BChE over AChE compared with CyCP. This molecular design strategy was further rationalized by docking molecular of fluorescence probes (CyClCP and CyCP) and enzymes (BChE and AChE). Finally, CyClCP was membrane permeable and successfully applied to image endogenous BChE level in HepG2 and LO2 cells. Therefore, CyClCP could serve as a promising tool for BChE-related physiological function studies in complex biological systems.

High exposure levels to OPs lead to seizures, cardiac arrest, and death if left untreated. Oximes are a critical piece to the therapeutic regimen which remove the OP from the inhibited AChE and restore normal cholinergic function. The current oximes 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and obidoxime (OBD) have two drawbacks: lack of broad spectrum protection against multiple OP structures and poor brain penetration to protect against OP central neurotoxicity. An alternative strategy to enhance therapy is reactivation of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). BChE is stoichiometrically inhibited by OPs with no apparent toxic result. Inhibition of BChE in the serum followed by reactivation could create a pseudo-catalytic scavenger allowing numerous regenerations of BChE to detoxify circulating OP molecules before they can reach target AChE. BChE in serum from rats, guinea pigs or humans was screened for the reactivation potential of our novel substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes, plus 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and OBD (100ŒºM) in vitro after inhibition by highly relevant surrogates of sarin, VX, and cyclosarin, and also DFP, and the insecticidal active metabolites paraoxon, phorate-oxon, and phorate-oxon sulfoxide. Novel oxime 15 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited rat serum BChE while novel oxime 20 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited human serum BChE. All tested oximes were poor reactivators of OP-inhibited guinea pig serum BChE. The bis-pyridinium oximes were poor BChE reactivators overall. BChE reactivation may be an additional mechanism to attenuate OP toxicity and contribute to therapeutic efficacy.

The reactivation of these inhibited enzymes is paramount for their normal function. Present study evaluates reactivation potency of two newly developed oximes, K456 and K733, against paraoxon (POX)-inhibited human-RBC-AChE and human-plasma-BChE in comparison to reported reactivator, pralidoxime (2-PAM). In vitro studies showed higher intrinsic toxicities of both oximes than 2-PAM for AChE. No substantial reactivation of hBChE was noted by tested concentration. Contrary to 2-PAM, the in silico study predicted lower binding free energies for both oximes. However, the detailed interaction study revealed inability of oximes to interact with catalytic anionic site of AChE and hBChE in contrast to 2-PAM. Both in vitro and in silico studies conclude that K456 and K733 are unlikely to be used as reactivators of paraoxon-inhibited AChE or BChE.

FURTHER, THE N-TERMINAL HSA-FUSED COCH1 PROTEINS WITH A LINKER HAVE FURTHER PROLONGED BIOLOGICAL HALF-LIVES: T ¬Äâ=¬Äâ17¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ2¬†H FOR BOTH HSA-EAAAK-COCH1 AND HSA-PAPAP-COCH1, AND T ¬Äâ=¬Äâ18¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ3¬†H FOR HSA-(PAPAP) -COCH1. THESE N-TERMINAL HSA-FUSED COCH1 PROTEINS MAY SERVE AS MORE PROMISING PROTEIN DRUG CANDIDATES FOR COCAINE ADDICTION TREATMENT.

ENVIRON SCI POLLUT RES INT 1614-7499 27 39365-39374 2019 10.1007/s11356-020-08197-2 EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES (OP) HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASE ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY, SUCH AS BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE). CHANGES IN BUCHE ACTIVITY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY, DIABETES, HYPERTHYROIDISM, AND METABOLIC SYNDROME. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES ON BOTH BUCHE AND LIPID PARAMETERS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE LIPID PARAMETERS IN URBAN SPRAYERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH BUCHE ACTIVITY. AN ANALYTICAL CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN WORKERS EXPOSED TO PESTICIDES. THE PESTICIDE EXPOSURES WERE EVALUATED BY THE MEASUREMENT OF URINARY DIALKYLPHOSPHATES. BUCHE ACTIVITY WAS DETERMINED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY IN SERUM, AND BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS WERE DETERMINED AT A CERTIFIED LABORATORY. INFORMATION REGARDING GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS, LIFESTYLE, AND OTHER ASPECTS WAS OBTAINED FROM A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE. THE RESULTS SHOWED VARIATIONS IN GLUCOSE, CHOLESTEROL, ALBUMIN, ATHEROGENIC INDEX, CREATININE, LDL, VLDL, TRIGLYCERIDES, AND TOTAL LIPIDS ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY. FURTHERMORE, POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BUCHE ACTIVITY AND LIPID PARAMETERS WERE OBSERVED; THESE EFFECTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BODY MASS INDEX. MORE STUDIES ARE NEEDED IN HUMAN POPULATION TO BETTER ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF BUCHE IN LIPID METABOLISM.
BARBOSA J;FARIA J;GARCEZ F;LEAL S;AFONSO LP;NASCIMENTO AV;MOREIRA R;QUEIR√≥S O;CARVALHO F;DINIS-OLIVEIRA RJ REPEATED ADMINISTRATION OF CLINICAL DOSES OF TRAMADOL AND TAPENTADOL CAUSES HEPATO- AND NEPHROTOXIC EFFECTS IN WISTAR RATS. PHARMACEUTICALS (BASEL) 1424-8247 13 NA 2020 10.3390/ph13070149 TRAMADOL AND TAPENTADOL ARE FULLY SYNTHETIC AND EXTENSIVELY USED ANALGESIC OPIOIDS, PRESENTING ENHANCED THERAPEUTIC AND SAFETY PROFILES AS COMPARED WITH THEIR PEERS. HOWEVER, REPORTS OF ADVERSE REACTIONS, INTOXICATIONS AND FATALITIES HAVE BEEN INCREASING. INFORMATION REGARDING THE MOLECULAR, BIOCHEMICAL, AND HISTOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS UNDERLYING THEIR TOXICOLOGICAL POTENTIAL IS MISSING, PARTICULARLY FOR TAPENTADOL, OWING TO ITS MORE RECENT MARKET AUTHORIZATION. CONSIDERING THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF LIVER AND KIDNEY FOR THE METABOLISM AND EXCRETION OF BOTH OPIOIDS, THESE ORGANS ARE ESPECIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO TOXICOLOGICAL DAMAGE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE AIMED TO CHARACTERIZE THE PUTATIVE HEPATIC AND RENAL DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF REPEATED EXPOSURE TO THERAPEUTIC DOSES OF TRAMADOL AND TAPENTADOL, USING AN IN VIVO ANIMAL MODEL. MALE WISTAR RATS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO SIX EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS, COMPOSED OF SIX ANIMALS EACH, WHICH RECEIVED DAILY SINGLE INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTIONS OF 10, 25 OR 50 MG/KG TRAMADOL OR TAPENTADOL (A LOW, STANDARD ANALGESIC DOSE, AN INTERMEDIATE DOSE AND THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED DAILY DOSE, RESPECTIVELY). AN ADDITIONAL CONTROL GROUP WAS INJECTED WITH NORMAL SALINE. FOLLOWING 14 CONSECUTIVE DAYS OF ADMINISTRATION, SERUM, URINE AND LIVER AND KIDNEY TISSUE SAMPLES WERE PROCESSED FOR BIOCHEMICAL, METABOLIC AND HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. REPEATED ADMINISTRATION OF THERAPEUTIC DOSES OF BOTH OPIOIDS LED TO: (I) INCREASED LIPID AND PROTEIN OXIDATION IN LIVER AND KIDNEY, AS WELL AS TO DECREASED TOTAL LIVER ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY; (II) DECREASED SERUM ALBUMIN, UREA, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND COMPLEMENT C3 AND C4 LEVELS, DENOTING LIVER SYNTHESIS IMPAIRMENT; (III) ELEVATED SERUM ACTIVITY OF LIVER ENZYMES, SUCH AS ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE, ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE, ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE AND Œ≥-GLUTAMYL TRANSPEPTIDASE, AS WELL AS LIPID PROFILE ALTERATIONS, ALSO REFLECTING HEPATOBILIARY COMMITMENT; (IV) DERANGEMENT OF IRON METABOLISM, AS SHOWN THROUGH INCREASES IN SERUM IRON, FERRITIN, HAPTOGLOBIN AND HEME OXYGENASE-1 LEVELS. IN TURN, ELEVATED SERUM CYSTATIN C, DECREASED URINE CREATININE OUTPUT AND INCREASED URINE MICROALBUMIN LEVELS WERE DETECTED UPON EXPOSURE TO TAPENTADOL ONLY, WHILE INCREASED SERUM AMYLASE AND URINE  -ACETYL-Œ≤-D-GLUCOSAMINIDASE ACTIVITIES WERE OBSERVED FOR BOTH OPIOIDS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE RESULTS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH KIDNEY INJURY. CHANGES WERE ALSO FOUND IN THE EXPRESSION LEVELS OF LIVER- AND KIDNEY-SPECIFIC TOXICITY BIOMARKER GENES, UPON EXPOSURE TO TRAMADOL AND TAPENTADOL, CORRELATING WELL WITH ALTERATIONS IN LIPID PROFILE, IRON METABOLISM AND GLOMERULAR AND TUBULAR FUNCTION. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS EVIDENCED SINUSOIDAL DILATATION, MICROSTEATOSIS, MONONUCLEAR CELL INFILTRATES, GLOMERULAR AND TUBULAR DISORGANIZATION, AND INCREASED BOWMAN'S SPACES. ALTHOUGH SOME FINDINGS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED UPON TAPENTADOL EXPOSURE, OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT, WHEN COMPARED WITH ACUTE EXPOSURE, PROLONGED ADMINISTRATION OF BOTH OPIOIDS SMOOTHS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEIR TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS, AND THAT THESE OCCUR AT LOWER DOSES WITHIN THE THERAPEUTIC RANGE.

J ETHNOPHARMACOL 1872-7573 260 112983 2020 10.1016/j.jep.2020.112983 PAEONIA SUFFRUTICOSA ANDR. HAS BEEN WIDELY USED IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE AS AN ANTI-TUMOUR, ANTI-OXIDANT, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENT. RESVERATROL OLIGOMERS ARE THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE SEED COAT EXTRACTS OF PAEONIA SUFFRUTICOSA (PSCE) AND HAVE DPPH FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING AND Œ≤-SECRETASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, STUDIES OF ITS EFFECT ON AMELIORATING COGNITIVE DEFICITS ARE LIMITED, AND ANALYSES OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ARE INSUFFICIENT. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES OF RESVERATROL OLIGOMERS FROM P. SUFFRUTICOSA IN VITRO AND THEIR EFFECTS ON DIMINISHING THE OXYGEN-GLUCOSE DEPRIVATION/REOXYGENATION (OGD/R) -INDUCED CYTOTOXICITY IN PC12¬†CELLS AND SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN MICE. MOREOVER, THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS WERE FURTHER EXPLORED. IN VITRO, THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF PSCE AND ITS 10 STILBENES ON ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) WERE EVALUATED USING THE ELLMAN'S ASSAY, AND ITS PROTECTIVE EFFECTS ON NORMAL AND OGD/R-INJURED PC12¬†CELLS WERE EVALUATED USING THE MTT ASSAY. FOR THE IN VIVO ASSAY, C57BL/6 MICE WERE ORALLY ADMINISTERED WITH PSCE AT DOSES OF 150 AND 600¬†MG/KG FOR 28 DAYS, AND INJECTED WITH SCOPOLAMINE (1.5¬†MG/KG) TO INDUCE COGNITIVE DEFICITS. THE MEMORY BEHAVIOURS WERE EVALUATED USING THE NOVEL OBJECT RECOGNITION, MORRIS WATER MAZE AND INHIBITORY AVOIDANCE TEST. LEVELS OF VARIOUS BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS WERE ALSO EXAMINED, INCLUDING ACHE, CHOLINE ACETYLTRANSFERASE (CHAT), ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH), SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD), CATALASE (CAT), GLUTATHIONE (GSH) IN THE MOUSE BRAIN AND INTERLEUKIN-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤), INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), INTERLEUKIN-4 (IL-4) IN SERUM. PSCE AND ITS 10 STILBENES DISPLAY GOOD INHIBITION OF ACHE AND BUCHE ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE VIABILITY OF NORMAL AND OGD/R-INJURED PC12¬†CELLS. PSCE IMPROVES THE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE OF SCOPOLAMINE-TREATED MICE IN BEHAVIOURAL TESTS. MEANWHILE, PSCE INCREASES ACHE, CHAT, SOD, AND CAT ACTIVITIES AND ACH, GSH, IL-4 LEVELS, AND DECREASES IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, TNF-Œ± LEVELS IN THE MODEL ANIMALS. RESVERATROL OLIGOMERS FROM P. SUFFRUTICOSA SHOW NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT IN VITRO AND IN VIVO BY REGULATING CHOLINERGIC, ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PATHWAYS, MAY HAVE PROMISING APPLICATION IN THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
THERKORN J;DREWRY DG;TIBURZI O;ASTATKE M;YOUNG C;RAINWATER-LOVETT K REVIEW OF BIOMARKERS AND ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES AND APPLICABILITY TO NERVE AGENTS. MIL MED 1930-613X 185 E414-E421 2019 10.1093/milmed/usz441 RECENT MALICIOUS USE OF CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENTS (CWAS) IS A REMINDER OF THEIR SEVERITY AND ONGOING THREAT. ONE OF THE MAIN CATEGORIES OF CWAS IS THE ORGANOPHOSPHATE (OP) NERVE AGENTS. PRESENTLY, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE OP NERVE AGENT BIOMARKERS THAT CAN FACILITATE IDENTIFICATION OF EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS POST-CWA INCIDENT. WHILE EXPOSURES TO OP NERVE AGENTS MAY BE SCENARIO-SPECIFIC, THE PUBLIC IS COMMONLY EXPOSED TO OP COMPOUNDS THROUGH THE UBIQUITOUS USE OF OP PESTICIDES, WHICH ARE CHEMICALLY RELATED TO NERVE AGENTS. THEREFORE, A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT WERE CONDUCTED FOR OP PESTICIDE BIOMARKER STUDIES TO SERVE AS A BASELINE TO ASSESS IF THESE APPROACHES MAY BE ADAPTED TO OP NERVE AGENT EXPOSURES. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW TO IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS OF OP PESTICIDE EXPOSURES. ENGLISH LANGUAGE STUDIES OF ANY DESIGN THAT REPORTED PRIMARY DATA ON BIOMARKERS FOR EXPOSURES IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES OR ADULT HUMAN STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION. USING STANDARD CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING THE COMPLETENESS OF REPORTED ANALYTICAL METHODS, THE QUALITY OF STUDY METHODS WAS CRITICALLY EVALUATED. A TOTAL OF 1,044 STUDIES OF BIOMARKERS OF OP PESTICIDE EXPOSURE WERE IDENTIFIED, OF WHICH 75 ARTICLES SATISFIED THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA. THESE STUDIES DESCRIBED 143 DIFFERENT ANALYTE/SAMPLE MATRIX COMBINATIONS: 99 HOST-BASED BIOMARKERS, 28 METABOLITES, 12 PESTICIDES, AND 4 ADDUCTS. THE MOST COMMONLY REPORTED BIOMARKERS WERE DIALKYL PHOSPHATE URINARY METABOLITES (22 STUDIES), BLOOD ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, AND PLASMA BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (26 STUDIES EACH). NONE OF THE ASSESSED QUALITY REVIEW CRITERIA WERE FULLY ADDRESSED BY ALL IDENTIFIED STUDIES, WITH ALMOST ALL CRITERIA SCORING LESS THAN 50%. CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY MAY HAVE UTILITY FOR IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WITH EXPOSURES SURPASSING A GIVEN THRESHOLD OF OP NERVE AGENT, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF HOW ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS CORRELATE WITH OBSERVED PATIENT SYMPTOMS MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE ACCURACY OF RESULTS. AS CWAS AND NERVE AGENTS ARE MORE READILY USED, MORE STANDARDIZED REPORTING OF BIOMARKER MEASUREMENTS ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES FOR OP NERVE AGENT BIOMARKERS.

INT J MOL SCI 1422-0067 20 NA 2019 10.3390/ijms20215385 A SET OF 25 NOVEL, SILICON-BASED CARBAMATE DERIVATIVES AS POTENTIAL ACETYL- AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE/BCHE) INHIBITORS WAS SYNTHESIZED AND CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR IN VITRO INHIBITION PROFILES AND THE SELECTIVITY INDEXES (SIS). THE PREPARED COMPOUNDS WERE ALSO TESTED FOR THEIR INHIBITION POTENTIAL ON PHOTOSYNTHETIC ELECTRON TRANSPORT (PET) IN SPINACH ( ) CHLOROPLASTS. IN FACT, SOME OF THE NEWLY PREPARED MOLECULES REVEALED COMPARABLE OR EVEN BETTER INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE MARKETED DRUGS (RIVASTIGMINE OR GALANTHAMINE) AND COMMERCIALLY APPLIED PESTICIDE DIURON , RESPECTIVELY. GENERALLY, MOST COMPOUNDS EXHIBITED BETTER INHIBITION POTENCY TOWARDS ACHE; HOWEVER, A WIDER ACTIVITY SPAN WAS OBSERVED FOR BCHE. NOTABLY, BENZYL  -[( )-2-[( -BUTYLDIMETHYLSILYL)OXY]-1-[(2-HYDROXYPHENYL)CARBAMOYL]ETHYL]-CARBAMATE ( ) AND BENZYL  -[( )-2-[( -BUTYLDIMETHYLSILYL)OXY]-1-[(3-HYDROXYPHENYL)CARBAMOYL]ETHYL]-CARBAMATE ( ) WERE CHARACTERIZED BY FAIRLY HIGH SELECTIVE INDEXES. SPECIFICALLY, COMPOUND   WAS PRESCRIBED WITH THE LOWEST IC  VALUE THAT CORRESPONDS QUITE WELL WITH GALANTHAMINE INHIBITION ACTIVITY, WHILE THE INHIBITORY PROFILES OF MOLECULES   AND BENZYL- -[( )-2-[( -BUTYLDIMETHYLSILYL)OXY]-1-[(4-HYDROXYPHENYL)CARBAMOYL]ETHYL]CARBAMATE ( ) ARE IN LINE WITH RIVASTIGMINE ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, A STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP (SAR)-DRIVEN SIMILARITY EVALUATION OF THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES FOR THE CARBAMATES EXAMINED APPEARED TO HAVE FORESEEN THE ACTIVITY CLIFFS USING A SIMILARITY-ACTIVITY LANDSCAPE INDEX FOR BCHE INHIBITORY RESPONSE VALUES. THE 'INDIRECT' LIGAND-BASED AND 'DIRECT' PROTEIN-MEDIATED IN SILICO APPROACHES WERE APPLIED TO SPECIFY ELECTRONIC/STERIC/LIPOPHILIC FACTORS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY VALID FOR QUANTITATIVE (Q)SAR MODELING OF THE CARBAMATE ANALOGUES. THE STOCHASTIC MODEL VALIDATION WAS USED TO GENERATE AN 'AVERAGE' 3D-QSAR PHARMACOPHORE PATTERN. FINALLY, THE TARGET-ORIENTED MOLECULAR DOCKING WAS EMPLOYED TO (RE)ARRANGE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIGAND PROPERTY SPACE FOR BCHE AND PHOTOSYSTEM II (PSII).

IN THIS STUDY, SIXTEEN NITROGENOUS DERIVATIVES OF PROGESTERONE WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY SYNTHESIZED HAVE BEEN USED FOR ALZHEIMER TARGETS. THE PROGESTERONE DERIVATIVES (1-16) WERE SCREENED FOR THEIR ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INHIBITORY POTENTIALS IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER. ALL THE COMPOUNDS EXHIBITED OVERWHELMING ACHE INHIBITIONS, WITH IC  VALUES RANGING FROM 14.40 TO 40.37¬ÄØŒºM. SIMILARLY, THE BCHE INHIBITORY POTENTIALS OF OUR COMPOUNDS WERE ALSO DOMINANT WITH IC VALUES BETWEEN 20.08 AND 46.84¬ÄØŒºM. IN COMPARISON TO OUR COMPOUNDS, THE STANDARD DRUG GALANTAMINE ATTAIN IC  VALUES OF 12.03 AND 18.20¬ÄØŒºM AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE RESPECTIVELY. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT THE COMPOUNDS EXERTED THEIR INHIBITORY ACTIVITY BY BINDING TO THE ACTIVE SITE OF THE ENZYME. THE CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE REGULATION OF LEARNING AND MEMORY PROCESSES AND HAS BEEN A MAJOR TARGET FOR THE DESIGN OF ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S DRUGS. THEREFORE, THESE NITROGEN-CONTAINING PROGESTERONE DERIVATIVES WILL BE OF POTENTIAL INTEREST TO RESEARCHERS WORKING IN AD FOR DEVELOPING NEW DRUGS OR CHEMICAL TOOLS TO STUDY THE DISEASE.

AD IS CHARACTERIZED BY IMPAIRED CHOLINERGIC TRANSMISSION, EXTRACELLULAR AMYLOID BETA DEPOSITS, NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES AND OXIDATIVE STRESS. A MULTI-TARGET DIRECTED LIGAND (MTDL) APPROACH IS REQUIRED TO DEVISE A THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY AGAINST AD. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, ASPARAGUS RACEMOSUS AQUEOUS EXTRACT WAS CHOSEN, AS IT POSSESS ABUNDANT MEDICINAL PROPERTIES INCLUDING NOOTROPIC EFFECT MENTIONED IN ANCIENT AYURVEDIC TEXTS. MOREOVER, ITS SECONDARY METABOLITE SARSASAPOGENIN (SRS) WAS ALSO SELECTED FOR THIS MULTI-TARGET STUDY FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. THE CURRENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT SARSASAPOGENIN SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITS KEY ENZYMES INVOLVED IN PATHOGENESIS OF AD WHICH ARE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), BACE1 AND MAO-B IN A CONCENTRATION DEPENDENT MANNER. SRS ALSO EXHIBITED ANTI-AMYLOIDOGENIC, ANTI-OXIDANT AND NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS BY IN VITRO STUDIES. THE IC  VALUES OF SRS IS 9.9¬ÄØŒºM AND 5.4¬ÄØŒºM FOR ACHE AND BUCHE RESPECTIVELY. SRS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED AŒ≤42 FIBRILLIZATION UP TO 68% AT 40¬ÄØŒºM CONCENTRATION AS COMPARED TO CONTROL. TEM VISUALIZATION SHOWED AŒ≤ AGGREGATES AS SHORT AND SCATTERED FIBRIL CLEARLY INDICATING SRS SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED PEPTIDE NUCLEATION AND FIBRIL FORMATION. FURTHERMORE, THE SRS WAS FOUND TO EXERT NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT ON PC12 CELLS AGAINST AŒ≤42 AND H O -MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY. THE CELL SURVIVAL WAS 62% AND 69% AGAINST AŒ≤42 AND H O -MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY, RESPECTIVELY. SRS ALSO INHIBITED MONOAMINOXIDASE-B (MAO-B) AND BACE1 ENZYMES IN CONCENTRATION DEPENDENT MANNER. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES INDICATED THAT SRS BINDS TO THE CATALYTIC SITES OF MULTIPLE TARGETS (ACHE, BUCHE, AŒ≤42, BACE1, AND MAO-B) IN A SIGNIFICANT MANNER THAT MIGHT HAVING DISEASE-MODIFYING EFFECTS. THUS SRS IS ACTING AS SUITABLE LEAD AND CAN BE UTILISED AS MTDL COMPOUND FOR FACTORS IMPLICATED IN AD.

RESEARCH ON THE METHANOL (MEOH) EXTRACT OF FLOWERS OF H. PLICATUM DC. SUBSP. PLICATUM RESULTED IN THE ISOLATION OF EIGHT KNOWN COMPOUNDS (1-8). THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES OF THE COMPOUNDS WERE DETERMINED AS Œ≤-SITOSTEROL (1), APIGENIN (2), NONACOSANOIC ACID (3), ASTRAGALIN (4), Œ≤-SITOSTEROL-3-O-Œ≤-D-GLUCOPYRANOSIDE (5), HELICHRYSIN A (6), HELICHRYSIN B (7), AND ISOSALIPURPOSIDE (8) BY SPECTROSCOPIC AND CHROMATOGRAPHIC/SPECTROMETRIC METHODS, INCLUDING 1D AND 2D NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY. NONACOSANOIC ACID (3) WAS ISOLATED FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM H. PLICATUM DC. SUBSP. PLICATUM. THE MEOH EXTRACT AND ISOLATED COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED FOR THEIR IN VITRO HUMAN CARBONIC ANHYDRASE I (HCAI) AND II (HCAII), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND Œ±-GLYCOSIDASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES. THE IC50 VALUES OF H. PLICATUM DC. SUBSP. PLICATUM MEOH EXTRACT FOR HCAI, HCAII, ACHE, BCHE, AND Œ±-GLYCOSIDASE WERE FOUND TO BE 77.87, 52.90, 115.50, 117.46, AND 81.53 MG/ML, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPOUNDS SHOWED IC50 VALUES OF 1.43-4.47, 1.40-4.32, 1.69-2.90, 1.09-3.89, AND 1.61-3.80 ŒºM AGAINST HCAI, HCAII, ACHE, BCHE, AND Œ±-GLYCOSIDASE, RESPECTIVELY. IN SUMMARY, H. PLICATUM DC. SUBSP. PLICATUM SECONDARY METABOLITES DEMONSTRATED STRONG INHIBITORY EFFECTS ESPECIALLY AGAINST HCAI AND HCAII, WHEREAS THE MEOH EXTRACT SHOWED A WEAK INHIBITORY EFFECT ON ALL ENZYMES.

THE PRESENT WORK DESCRIBES THE SYNTHESES OF SELECTED 1,3-BENZODIOXINE-CONTAINING CHALCONES (CD3, CD8 AND CD10), AND THEIR INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST MAO-A, MAO-B, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). COMPOUND CD8 MOST POTENTLY INHIBITED MAO-B WITH AN IC  VALUE OF 0.026¬ÄÖŒºM, FOLLOWED BY CD10 AND CD3 (1.54 AND 1.68¬ÄÖŒºM, RESPECTIVELY). CD8 POTENTLY AND NON-SELECTIVELY INHIBITED MAO-A (IC  VALUE OF 0.023¬ÄÖŒºM). ON THE OTHER HAND, CD10 AND CD8 INHIBITED ACHE WITH IC  VALUES OF 5.40 AND 9.57¬ÄÖŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. KINETICS AND REVERSIBILITY EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT ALL SYNTHESIZED MOLECULES WERE COMPETITIVE AND REVERSIBLE INHIBITORS, AND THE K  VALUES OF CD8 FOR MAO-A AND MAO-B WERE 0.018 AND 0.0019¬ÄÖŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. BY IN¬ÄÖVITRO AND IN SILICO ANALYSES, ALL COMPOUNDS WERE FOUND TO HAVE HIGH PASSIVE HUMAN GASTROINTESTINAL ABSORPTIONS, BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITIES, AND NON-TOXICITIES. MOLECULAR DOCKING SIMULATIONS REVEALED THAT DOCKING AFFINITY OF EACH COMPOUND FOR MAO-B WAS HIGHER THAN THAT FOR MAO-A. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT CD8 IS A POTENT NON-SELECTIVE MAO INHIBITOR, AND CD10 IS AN EFFECTIVE SELECTIVE MAO-B INHIBITOR, AND BOTH POSSESS ACHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. THEREFORE, WE SUGGEST THAT CD8 AND CD10 BE CONSIDERED POTENTIAL DUAL-TARGETING INHIBITORS OF MAO AND ACHE FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS.

RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT DANTROLENE HAS A WEAK INHIBITORY EFFECT ON ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), WHICH IS A THERAPEUTIC DRUG TARGET FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. THUS, WE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING OF ACHE INHIBITORS WITH BENZYLPIPERIDINE/PIPERAZINE MOIETIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE DANTROLENE SKELETON. SEVERAL DERIVATIVES SHOWED AN INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. AMONG THEM, ORTHO-NITRO DERIVATIVE 8C SHOWED THE MOST POTENT INHIBITORY ACTIVITY WITH THE IC  VALUE OF 34.2¬†NM. FURTHERMORE, LINEWEAVER-BURK PLOT ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT 8C IS ACHE-SELECTIVE INHIBITOR, WHICH SHOWS ONLY A WEAK INHIBITORY EFFECT ON BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) AND A NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION.

FOOD CHEM 1873-7072 327 127045 2020 10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.127045 IN THIS STUDY, THE INHIBITORY POTENTIALS OF FOOD ORIGINATED 34 PHENOLIC ACIDS, AND FLAVONOID COMPOUNDS WERE SCREENED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, UREASE, AND TYROSINASE ENZYMES. ALL COMPOUNDS INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY EXHIBITED HIGH ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WITH AN IGNORABLE CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY. IN GENERAL, THEY ALSO SHOWED POOR ANTI-UREASE AND ANTI-TYROSINASE ACTIVITIES. COMPOUNDS IN AGLYCONE FORM (QUERCETIN, MYRICETIN, CHRYSIN, AND LUTEOLIN) SHOWED STRONG ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES. NO RELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TESTED BIOACTIVITIES EXCEPT FROM THE CASE THAT AGLYCONE COMPOUNDS EXHIBITED A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES AND ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY. INTERESTINGLY, THERE WAS A RELATION BETWEEN THE MOLECULAR WEIGHTS OF AGLYCONE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT FLAVONOIDS WITH MOLECULAR MASS OF 250-320¬†G/MOL HAVE HIGH POTENTIAL OF ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES AND ARE VALUABLE FOR FUTURE EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS AND HUMANS. POTENTIAL INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF THESE MOLECULES ON TARGET PROTEINS WERE INVESTIGATED USING DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS CALCULATIONS.

However, the assays for BChE activity are highly dependent on expensive and bulk equipment and professional operators, which limits its straightforward and portable detection. In this work, we proposed a straightforward and sensitive photothermal assay for the detection of BChE activity, avoiding the use of expensive instrument, professional operators, and separation process. Polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles can be produced through the oxidation of dopamine by MnO2 nanosheets, which show a rather strong photothermal features. Hydrolyzation of substrate into thiocholine and butyrate happens after introducing BChE. The generated thiocholine and butyrate inhibit the formation of PDA nanoparticle through reducing MnO2 into Mn2+ and creating an acidic environment, respectively. Those effects lead to the decreasing of photothermal efficiency of the reaction system, resulting in the decreasing on temperature change. Quantitative detection of BChE activity is achieved by recording the temperature change of system, using a common device, with a limit of detection of 40.65¬ U/L calculated. The presented results provide a clue for developing straightforward and portable photothermal assay for BChE, which shows great potential for their clinical applications.

This study investigated serum choline and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) responses, and their correlations with inflammatory, oxidative stress and tissue damage biomarkers, including paraoxanase-1 (PON1), and clinical signs in calves with endotoxemia and the effect of choline treatment in these responses. Healthy calves (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ20) were divided equally into 4 groups: Control (0.9% NaCl, iv), Choline (C; 1‚ÄØmg/kg/iv,once), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2‚ÄØŒºg/kg/iv,once) and LPS‚ÄØ+‚ÄØC. Clinical and laboratory examinations were performed before and 0.5‚Äì48‚ÄØh (hrs) after treatments. Following LPS administration, serum choline level increased at 0.5-24‚ÄØh (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ.01), whereas serum BChE and PON1 level decreased at 48‚ÄØh (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ.01) compared to their baselines. In LPS‚ÄØ+‚ÄØC group, the increase in serum choline level was significantly higher (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ.01) than that of C and LPS groups. LPS did not decrease serum BChE levels significantly in calves treated with choline. Serum choline and BChE results correlated negatively with white blood cell count and positively (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ.001) with PON1 levels, oxidative stress index, inflammation and hepato-muscular injury markers. In conclusion serum choline and BChE may have a role in the pathophysiology of endotoxemia in calves. High serum choline concentration is associated with an improvement in response to LPS administration in calves treated with choline, probably by preventing the imbalances between oxidative stress and anti-oxidant capacity, preventing the serum BChE and PON1 decreases, and inhibition/attenuation of acute phase reaction and hepato-muscular injury in calves with endotoxemia.

THE USE OF PESTICIDES HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED TO LEAD TO SEVERAL ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASE, PRIMARILY BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE IS A GOOD INDICATOR OF OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATES AND CARBAMATES.  THIS CASE-CONTROL STUDY AIMS TO STUDY THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AMONG FARMERS AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN THE SOUSS MASSA REGION BY ANALYZING VARIATIONS IN THE RESPONSE OF A PESTICIDES EXPOSURE BIOMARKER: SERUM CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY (BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE)).  THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE STUDY CONDUCTED ON 133 PARTICIPANTS (71 FARMERS AND 62 NON-FARMERS). A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS APPLIED COLLECTING SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND DETERMINING KNOWLEDGE AND WORK PRACTICES IN RELATION TO PESTICIDE USE. THE ACTIVITY OF SERUM CHOLINESTERASE WAS MEASURED BY THE BUTYRULTHIOCHOLINE METHOD A SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ASSAY.  THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 42.5¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ10.66¬ÄâYEARS. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BCHE ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE PLASMA OF FARMERS EXPOSED TO PESTICIDES, COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP ( ¬Äâ<¬Äâ0.05). THE MEASURED MEAN LEVEL OF BCHE ACTIVITY WAS (7304.80¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ1939.99¬ÄâU/L) AND (9746.42¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ1699.85¬ÄâU/L) IN THE FARMERS AND THE CONTROL GROUP (NON-FARMERS), RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, A HIGH PROPORTION OF FARMERS REPORTED THAT EMPTY CONTAINERS ARE BURNED IN THE OPEN (74.6%) FOR WASTE DISPOSAL. A PROPORTION (11.3%) OF FARMERS ALSO REPORTED THAT EMPTY CONTAINER WASTE IS SPILLED ON THE FARM.  THE DECREASE IN BCHE INDICATES A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AMONG FARMERS WHO USE ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT REGULAR MONITORING FOR BLOOD CHOLINESTERASE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE PESTICIDE EXPOSURE TO PREVENT HEALTH EFFECTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO FARMERS.

Serum activities of PON1 and BChE were higher in dogs with HAC than healthy dogs. There were strong positive correlations between PON1 activity measured with the three different substrates. This study demonstrated increased serum PON1 and BChE activities in dogs with HAC that could be attributed to the direct effect of glucocorticoids and lipid mobilisation.

In two-stage batch cultures, switching between growth and induction phases by exchanging media, the maximum active rrBChE levels were comparable among the bioreactor runs with controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations from 10‚Äì40% DO and without controlled DO at constant aeration rate. For a single-stage batch operation with no media exchange at 40% DO, production of rrBChE is triggered simply through sugar depletion due to the uptake of sugar by the cells, showing similar maximum active cell-associated rrBChE level compared to two-stage batch operations. However, the bioreactor process using uncontrolled DO, no media exchange, and half-concentration of sucrose resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in the maximum total active rrBChE (77‚ÄØŒºg/g fresh weight) and 1.6-fold increase of total active rrBChE specific productivity (86‚ÄØŒºg (g dry weight)‚àí1 day‚àí1) compared to the two-stage batch cultures. We found that monitoring the culture pH is a simple non-invasive technique that can help identify the start and progress of the induction phase in a single-stage culture. Altogether, we demonstrate a simplified, efficient, economical, and scalable bioreactor process for rrBChE production in metabolically regulated transgenic rice cell cultures.

THE INFECTED ANIMALS WERE SUBDIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS ACCORDING TO THEIR PARASITEMIA RATES (<20 % AND>20 %). FURTHERMORE, 10 HEALTHY CATTLE WERE INCLUDED AS THE CONTROL. THE INFECTION CAUSED SEVERE ANEMIA IN A PARASITEMIA-BURDEN DEPENDENT FASHION. THE ACTIVITIES OF CATALASE AND GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE AS WELL AS THE LEVELS OF TAC, ZINC, SELENIUM, COPPER AND MANGANESE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AS THE PARASITEMIA INCREASED, ACCORDINGLY. HOWEVER, THE ACTIVITY OF SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE AS WELL AS THE LEVELS OF MALONDIALDEHYDE, PROTEIN CARBONYLATION, DNA DAMAGE AND IRON, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED IN A PARASITEMEIA-BURDEN DEPENDENT MANNER. ADDITIONALLY, GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE ACTIVITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED WITH THE LOWER RATE OF PARASITEMIA, BUT THE HIGHER RATE HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT AS COMPARED TO CONTROL. MOREOVER, TOTAL, PROTEIN AND LIPID BINDING SA CONTENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BUT THE ACTIVITIES OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED, PARASITEMIA DEPENDENTLY.

THEY MAY ALSO INTERACT WITH MUSCLE-TYPE NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTORS (NACHRS) AND THUS AFFECT THE NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION AND MUSCLE FUNCTION. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE EFFECTS OF THE ORGANOMETALLIC RUTHENIUM COMPLEX OF 5-NITRO-1,10-PHENANTHROLINE (NITROPHEN) WERE EVALUATED ON THESE SYSTEMS. THE ORGANORUTHENIUM-NITROPHEN COMPLEX [(Œ∑ -P-CYMENE)RU(NITROPHEN)CL]CL; C H CL N O RU (C1-CL) WAS SYNTHESIZED, STRUCTURALLY CHARACTERIZED AND EVALUATED IN VITRO FOR ITS INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST ELECTRIC EEL ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (EEACHE), HUMAN RECOMBINANT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (HRACHE), HORSE SERUM BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (HSBCHE) AND HORSE LIVER GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE. THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF C1-CL WERE THEN STUDIED ON ISOLATED MOUSE PHRENIC NERVE-HEMIDIAPHRAGM MUSCLE PREPARATIONS, BY MEANS OF SINGLE TWITCH MEASUREMENTS AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS. THE COMPOUND C1-CL ACTED AS A COMPETITIVE INHIBITOR OF EEACHE, HRACHE AND HSBCHE WITH CONCENTRATIONS PRODUCING 50 % INHIBITION (IC ) OF ENZYME ACTIVITY RANGING FROM 16 TO 26 ŒºM. MOREOVER, C1-CL INHIBITED THE NERVE-EVOKED ISOMETRIC MUSCLE CONTRACTION (IC  = 19.44 ŒºM), WITHOUT AFFECTING THE DIRECTLY-EVOKED MUSCLE SINGLE TWITCH UP TO 40 ŒºM. THE BLOCKING EFFECT OF C1-CL WAS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETELY REVERSED BY NEOSTIGMINE, A REVERSIBLE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR. THE ENDPLATE POTENTIALS WERE ALSO INHIBITED BY C1-CL IN A CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT MANNER (IC  = 7.6 ŒºM) WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE RESTING MEMBRANE POTENTIAL OF MUSCLE FIBERS UP TO 40 ŒºM. FINALLY, C1-CL (5-40 ŒºM) DECREASED (I) THE AMPLITUDE OF MINIATURE ENDPLATE POTENTIALS UNTIL A COMPLETE BLOCK BY CONCENTRATIONS HIGHER THAN 25 ŒºM AND (II) THEIR FREQUENCY AT 10 ŒºM OR HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS. THE COMPOUND C1-CL REVERSIBLY BLOCKED THE NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION IN VITRO BY A NON-DEPOLARIZING MECHANISM AND MAINLY THROUGH AN ACTION ON POSTSYNAPTIC NACHRS. THE COMPOUND C1-CL MAY BE THEREFORE INTERESTING FOR FURTHER PRECLINICAL TESTING AS A NEW COMPETITIVE NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING, AND THUS MYORELAXANT, DRUG.

USING 1D AND VARIOUS 2D NMR MEASUREMENTS, WE DETERMINED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF PREPARED ISOMERS HOLDS THE Œ≤-ARYL-Œ≤-AMINOETHANOL MOIETY, IN CONTRAST TO THE Œ±-ARYL-Œ≤-AMINOETHANOL MOIETY FOUND IN SALMETEROL AND ALBUTEROL. WE INVESTIGATED THE REACTION OF Œ≤-HALOHYDRIN AND AMINES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF Œ≤-ARYL-Œ≤-AMINO ALCOHOL - BOTH EXPERIMENTALLY AND USING COMPUTATIONAL METHODS. THE STRUCTURE OF Œ≤-HALOHYDRIN WITH THE METHYL SALICYLATE MOIETY IMPOSES THE COURSE OF THE REACTION. THE SOLVENT PLAYS A RELEVANT, YET AMBIGUOUS ROLE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE REACTION, WHILE THE STRENGTH OF THE BASE INFLUENCES THE REACTION YIELD AND ISOMER RATIO IN A MORE EVIDENT WAY. USING COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MOST PROBABLE REACTION INTERMEDIATE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF THE UNEXPECTED ISOMER IS THE CORRESPONDING PARA-QUINONE METHIDE, WHICH CAN BE FORMED DUE TO PHENOL PRESENT IN THE METHYL SALICYLATE MOIETY. AFTER SUCCESSFUL PREPARATION OF ALBUTEROL AND SALMETEROL ISOMERS, WE TESTED THEIR INHIBITION POTENCY TO HUMAN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND USUAL AND ATYPICAL BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). KINETIC STUDIES REVEALED THAT BOTH ISOMERS ARE LOW-POTENCY REVERSIBLE INHIBITORS OF HUMAN CHOLINESTERASES.

Although the enzyme is relatively stable, its activity is affected by numerous factors, including pressure. In this work, hydrostatic pressure dependence of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in native and salted human butyrylcholinesterase was studied up to the maximum pressure at ambient temperature of about 1200‚ÄØMPa. A correlated large shift toward long wavelengths and broadening observed at pressures between 200 and 700‚ÄØMPa was interpreted as due to high pressure-induced denaturation of the protein, leading to an enhanced exposure of tryptophan residues into polar solvent environment. This transient process in native butyrylcholinesterase presumably involves conformational changes of the enzyme at both tertiary and secondary structure levels. Pressure-induced mixing of emitting local indole electronic transitions with quenching charge transfer states likely describes the accompanying fluorescence quenching that reveals different course from spectral changes. All the pressure-induced changes turned irreversible after passing a mid-point pressure of about 400‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ50‚ÄØMPa. Addition of either 0.1‚ÄØM ammonium sulphate (a kosmotropic salt) or 0.1‚ÄØM lithium thiocyanate (a chaotropic salt) to native enzyme similarly destabilized its structure.

The crystal structure of the inhibitor 18 in complex with BChE revealed the molecular basis for its low nanomolar inhibition (IC50¬ =¬ 2.8¬ nM). The favourable in¬ vitro results enabled a first-in-animal in¬ vivo efficacy and safety trial, which demonstrated a positive impact on fear-motivated and spatial long-term memory retrieval without any concomitant adverse motor effects.

In this study, we carried out a structure-based virtual screening followed by in vitro activity assays, with the goal to identify new inhibitors that are selective for BChE over acetylcholinesterase (AChE). As a result, a set of new, selective inhibitors of human BChE were identified from natural products with solanaceous alkaloid scaffolds. The most active one of the natural products (compound 1) identified has an IC50 of 16.8‚ÄØnM against BChE. It has been demonstrated that the desirable selectivity of these inhibitors for BChE over AChE is mainly controlled by three key residues in the active site cavity, i.e. residues Q119, A277, and A328 in BChE versus the respective residues Y124, W286, and Y337 in AChE. Based on this structural insight, future rational design of new, potent and selective BChE inhibitors may focus on these key structural differences in the active site cavity.

It is also produced in the human body as a metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), one of the most toxic natural products known. Previous studies have shown that AFM1 is a potential inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and therefore, a potential neurotoxic agent. In this work, surface screening (SS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on human acetylcholinesterase AChE (HssAChE) were performed to corroborate literature data regarding preferential binding sites and type of inhibition. Also, an inedited theoretical study on the interactions of AFM1 with human butyrylcholinesterase (HssBChE) was performed. In vitro inhibition tests on both enzymes were done to support theoretical results. MD simulations suggested the catalytic anionic site of HssAChE as the preferential binding site for AFM1 and also that this metabolite is not a good inhibitor of HssBChE, corroborating previous studies. In vitro assays also corroborated molecular modeling studies by showing that AFM1 did not inhibit BChE and was able to inhibit AChE, although not as much as AFB1.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay proved the safety of 2513‚Äì4169 on diverse neural cell lines. Moreover, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay performed on SH-SY5Y cells proved the neuroprotective effect of 2513‚Äì4169 against toxic AŒ≤1‚Äì42.

UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS, ETHYL 2-ARYLHYDRAZINYLIDENE-3-OXOBUTANOATES WERE ALSO FOUND TO UNDERGO DEALKYLATION RATHER THAN THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED CYCLIZATION INTO CINNOLONES. STUDY OF THE ESTERASE PROFILE OF THESE COMPOUNDS SHOWED THAT TRIFLUOROMETHYL-CONTAINING ACIDS, IN CONTRAST TO NON-FLUORINATED ANALOGS, WERE EFFECTIVE AND SELECTIVE INHIBITORS OF CARBOXYLESTERASE (CES), WITHOUT SUBSTANTIALLY INHIBITING STRUCTURALLY RELATED CHOLINESTERASES (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE). MOREOVER, BOTH 3-OXO-4,4,4-TRIFLUOROBUTANOIC AND 3-OXOBUTANOIC ACIDS HAVING METHYL OR METHOXY SUBSTITUENT IN THE ARYLHYDRAZINYLIDENE FRAGMENT SHOWED HIGH ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY IN THE ABTS TEST. THUS, 2-ARYLHYDRAZINYLIDENE-3-OXO-4,4,4-TRIFLUOROBUTANOIC ACIDS WERE FOUND TO CONSTITUTE A NEW CLASS OF EFFECTIVE AND SELECTIVE CES INHIBITORS THAT ALSO POSSESS HIGH RADICAL-SCAVENGING ACTIVITY.

In this study, the synthesized compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, selenium and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds (1‚Äì6) were evaluated against the human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I, and II isoenzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and Œ±-glycosidase enzymes. The synthesized heterocyclic compounds showed IC50 values in range of 33.32‚Äì60.79¬ nM against hCA I, and 37.05‚Äì66.64¬ nM against hCA II closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes. On the other hand, IC50 values were found in range of 13.13‚Äì22.21¬ nM against AChE, 0.54‚Äì31.22¬ nM against BChE, and 13.51‚Äì26.55¬ nM against Œ±-glycosidase as a hydrolytic enzyme. As a result, nitrogen, phosphorus, selenium and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds (1‚Äì6) demonstrated potent inhibition profiles against indicated metabolic enzymes.

THE PATHOLOGICAL FEATURE OF THE DISEASE INVOLVES Œ≤-AMYLOID SENILE PLAQUES, REDUCED LEVELS OF ACETYLCHOLINE NEUROTRANSMITTER, OXIDATIVE STRESS AND NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES FORMATION WITHIN THE BRAIN OF AD PATIENTS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO SCREEN THE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF NEWLY SYNTHESIZED AND EXISTING NOVEL 4-METHYLTHIOCOUMARIN DERIVATIVE AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, BACE1, Œ≤-AMYLOID AGGREGATION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS INVOLVED IN THE AD PATHOGENESIS. THE IN VITRO ASSAYS USED IN THIS STUDY WERE ELLMAN'S ASSAY, FRET ASSAYS, THIOFLAVIN T, TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, CIRCULAR DICHROISM, FRAP, AND TEAC. MOLECULAR DOCKING AND DYNAMICS STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO CORRELATE THE RESULTS. C3 AND C7 (THIOCOUMARIN DERIVATIVES) WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST POTENT INHIBITORS OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (IC -5.63¬†¬µM) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (IC -3.40¬†¬µM) USING ELLMAN'S ASSAYS. ENZYME KINETIC STUDIES SHOWED THAT C3 AND C7 COMPOUNDS FOLLOWED BY THE MIXED MODE OF INHIBITION USING LB PLOT. C3 ALSO MODERATELY INHIBITED THE BACE1 USING FRET ASSAY. C3 INHIBITED THE FIBRILLIZATION OF Œ≤-AMYLOID PEPTIDES IN A CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT MANNER AS OBSERVED BY THIOFLAVIN T, TEM STUDIES AND CIRCULAR DICHROISM DATA. MOLECULAR MODELING STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBABLE MODE OF BINDING OF C3 AND C7 IN THE BINDING POCKET OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, BACE1 AND AMYLOID Œ≤ PEPTIDES. THIS INDICATES THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN C3 AND ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE. C3 ALSO EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL BY FRAP AND TEAC ASSAYS. HENCE, C3 MIGHT SERVE AS A PROMISING LEAD FOR DEVELOPING NOVEL MULTI TARGET-DIRECTED LIGAND FOR THE TREATMENT OF AD.

Most of the compounds were found to be selective for butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) over acetylcholinesterase (AChE), with IC50 values ranging from 0.363¬ ŒºM to 53.0¬ ŒºM determined after 15¬ s of enzyme exposure. Comparison of the most potent compound, 3b with its constitutional isomer 2b revealed the high importance of phosphate positioning. Reversed selectivity and a 100-fold reduction in anti-BChE activity was observed when the organophosphate was attached to the benzyl instead of the coumarin. Docking calculations suggest that 3b binds initially as a transition state mimic with near-optimal phosphate orientation relative to S198 and occupation of the oxyanion hole prior to phosphorylation. These results might inspire the design of a new type of non-neuropathic and irreversible coumarin-based inhibitor against BChE.

Their inhibitory activities were evaluated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The di-n-butyl phosphate series consistently displayed selective inhibition of BChE over AChE. The most potent inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase were di-n-butyl-3,5-dimethylphenyl phosphate (4b) [KI=1.0¬±0.4ŒºM] and di-n-butyl 2-naphthyl phosphate (5b) [KI=1.9¬±0.4ŒºM]. Molecular modeling was used to uncover three subsites within the active site gorge that accommodate the three substituents attached to the phosphate group. Phosphates 4b and 5b were found to bind to these three subsites in analogous fashion with the aromatic groups in both analogs being accommodated by the ‚Äúlower region,‚Ä  while the lone pairs on the PO oxygen atoms were oriented towards the oxyanion hole. In contrast, di-n-butyl-3,4-dimethylphenyl phosphate (4a) [KI=9¬±1ŒºM], an isomer of 4b, was found to orient its aromatic group in the ‚Äúupper left region‚Ä  subsite as placement of this group in the ‚Äúlower region‚Ä  resulted in significant steric hindrance by a ridge-like region in this subsite. Future studies will be designed to exploit these features in an effort to develop inhibitors of higher inhibitory strength against butyrylcholinesterase.

THE STRUCTURES OF THE SYNTHESIZED EIGHT NEW COMPOUNDS WERE CHARACTERIZED USING IR,  H NMR,  C NMR, AND HR-MS SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS. SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS INHIBITORY ACTIVITY DETERMINED AGAINST THE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (GST) ENZYMES WITH KI VALUES IN THE RANGE 25.23-42.19¬†¬µM FOR ACHE, 19.37-34.22¬†¬µM FOR BCHE, AND 21.84-41.14¬†¬µM FOR GST, RESPECTIVELY. BINDING SCORES OF MOST ACTIVE INHIBITORS AGAINST ACHE, BCHE, AND GST ENZYMES WERE DETECTED AS -10.294¬†KCAL/MOL, -9.562¬†KCAL/MOL, AND -7.112¬†KCAL/MOL, RESPECTIVELY. THE HYDROXYBENZYLIDENE MOIETY OF THE MOST ACTIVE INHIBITORS CAUSED TO INHIBITION OF THE ENZYMES THROUGH HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTION AND HYDROGEN BOND.

BIOORG CHEM 1090-2120 92 103216 2019 10.1016/j.bioorg.2019.103216 IN OUR CURRENT RESEARCH, A DIVERSE EFFECT OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS WAS STUDIED ON BALB-C MICE BY USING PENTYLENETETRAZOLE (PTZ) SEIZURE MODEL. A SERIES OF CARBOXAMIDE ANALOGS (4A-4I) HAVE BEEN SYNTHESIZED VIA SUZUKI COUPLING REACTION IN MODERATE TO GOOD YIELDS (35-84%). TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS AGAINST AD, IN-VITRO INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WAS PERFORMED. A NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS SHOWED INHIBITION IN LOW MICROMOLAR RANGE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THESE COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED FOR ANTICONVULSIVE EFFECTS IN BALB-C MICE BY USING PENTYLENETETRAZOLE (PTZ) SEIZURE MODEL. THE COMPOUND 4E DISPLAYED POTENTIAL ANTICONVULSIVE EFFECT AND DISPLAYED 50% AND 80% PROTECTION FROM MORTALITY AT THE DOSE OF 10¬ÄØMG/KG, AND 30¬ÄØMG/KG RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPOUND 4H SHOWED SOME PROTECTION (33%) FROM MORTALITY AT 10¬ÄØMG/KG AND WAS NOT FURTHER EXPLORED BASED ON NON-SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN ONSET OF MYOCLONIC SEIZURES. WHILE, OTHER COMPOUNDS FROM THE SERIES DID NOT SHOW ANY ANTICONVULSIVE ACTIVITY. TO RATIONALIZE THE OBSERVED BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, WE PERFORMED DOCKING STUDIES AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE TARGETS. TO EXPLORE THE RATIONALE OF THE MECHANISM OF IN-VIVO ANTICONVULSANT ACTIVITY, DOCKING STUDIES WERE PERFORMED ON GABAERGIC RECEPTORS. MOREOVER, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSIOCHEMICAL DATA OF THE SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS AND THEIR IN-VIVO PERFORMANCE, WE EMPLOYED IN-SILICO PHARMACOKINETIC PREDICTIONS. OUR IN-SILICO PREDICTIONS SUGGEST THAT THE PLASMA PROTEIN BINDING, LOW TO MODERATE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER PENETRATION AND LOW SOLUBILITY ARE THE MAIN ATTRIBUTES OF LOW IN-VIVO PERFORMANCE.

COMPOUND 5F EXHIBITED THE BEST INHIBITORY ACTIVITY FOR ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND HAD SURPRISINGLY POTENT INHIBITORY ACTIVITY FOR BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), WITH IC  VALUES OF 0.72¬ÄØŒºM AND 0.16¬ÄØŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS FROM LINEWEAVER-BURK PLOT AND MOLECULAR MODELING STUDY INDICATED NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION OF ACHE BY COMPOUND 5F. IN ADDITION, THESE DERIVATIVES SHOWED POTENT SELF-INDUCED Œ≤-AMYLOID (AŒ≤) AGGREGATION INHIBITION. MOREOVER, 5F DIDN'T SHOW OBVIOUS TOXICITY AGAINST PC12 AND HEPG2 CELLS AT 50¬ÄØŒºM. FINALLY, IN VIVO STUDIES CONFIRMED THAT 5F SIGNIFICANTLY AMELIORATES THE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCES OF SCOPOLAMINE-TREATED ICR MICE. THEREFORE, THESE GRAVEOLININE DERIVATIVES SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

ARCH PHARM (WEINHEIM) 1521-4184 352 E1900027 2019 10.1002/ardp.201900027 A SERIES OF BIS(4-AMINO-5-CYANO-PYRIMIDINES) WAS SYNTHESIZED AND EVALUATED AS DUAL INHIBITORS OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF THE NEW DERIVATIVES, THEIR ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO TESTED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT MOST OF THESE COMPOUNDS COULD EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT ACHE AND BCHE. PARTICULARLY, COMPOUND 7C EXHIBITED THE BEST ACHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY (IC  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ5.72¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ1.53¬ÄâŒºM), WHEREAS COMPOUND 7H WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST POTENT BCHE INHIBITOR (IC  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ12.19¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ0.57¬ÄâŒºM). MOLECULAR MODELING STUDY REVEALED THAT COMPOUNDS 7C, 7F, AND 7B SHOWED A HIGHER INHIBITORY ACTIVITY THAN THAT OF GALANTAMINE AGAINST BOTH ACHE AND BCHE. ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS 7H, 7B, AND 7C WAS SIGNIFICANT IN VITRO AND IN SILICO FOR BOTH ENZYMES, SINCE THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE HYDROPHOBIC RINGS (BR-PHENYL, DIMETHYL, AND METHOXYPHENYL), WHICH BIND VERY WELL IN BOTH SITES. IN ADDITION TO CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES, THESE COMPOUNDS SHOWED DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES. INDEED, IN THE SUPEROXIDE-DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE ALKALINE ASSAY, COMPOUND 7J SHOWED VERY HIGH INHIBITION (IC  ¬Äâ=¬Äâ0.37¬Äâ¬±¬Äâ0.28¬ÄâŒºM). ALSO, COMPOUND 7L EXHIBITED STRONG AND GOOD ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY AGAINST STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, RESPECTIVELY. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RESULTS OF BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION, FURTHER MODIFICATIONS WILL BE DESIGNED TO INCREASE POTENCY ON DIFFERENT TARGETS. IN THIS STUDY, THE OBTAINED RESULTS CAN BE A NEW STARTING POINT FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL AGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST PORCINE LIVER CES, ALONG WITH TWO STRUCTURALLY RELATED SERINE HYDROLASES, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, WERE INVESTIGATED USING ENZYME KINETICS AND MOLECULAR DOCKING. KINETICS STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TESTED KETO-ESTERS ARE REVERSIBLE AND SELECTIVE MIXED-TYPE CES INHIBITORS. ANALYSIS OF X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DATA TOGETHER WITH OUR IR AND NMR SPECTRA AND QM CALCULATIONS INDICATED THAT THE Z-ISOMERS WERE THE MOST STABLE. THE KINETIC DATA WERE WELL EXPLAINED BY THE MOLECULAR DOCKING RESULTS OF THE Z-ISOMERS, WHICH SHOWED SPECIFIC BINDING OF THE COMPOUNDS IN THE CES CATALYTIC ACTIVE SITE WITH CARBONYL OXYGEN ATOMS IN THE OXYANION HOLE AND NON-SPECIFIC BINDING OUTSIDE IT. SOME COMPOUNDS WERE STUDIED AS INHIBITORS OF THE MAIN HUMAN ISOZYMES INVOLVED IN BIOTRANSFORMATION OF ESTER-CONTAINING DRUGS, HCES1 AND HCES2. ESTERS OF GERANIOL (3D) AND ADAMANTOL (3E) PROVED TO BE HIGHLY ACTIVE AND SELECTIVE INHIBITORS OF HCES2, INHIBITING THE ENZYME IN THE NANOMOLAR RANGE, WHEREAS ESTERS OF BORNEOL (3F) AND ISOBORNEOL (3G) WERE MORE ACTIVE AND SELECTIVE AGAINST HCES1. COMPUTATIONAL ADMET STUDIES REVEALED THAT ALL TEST COMPOUNDS HAD EXCELLENT INTESTINAL ABSORPTION, MEDIUM BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITY, AND LOW HERG LIABILITY RISKS. MOREOVER, ALL TEST COMPOUNDS POSSESSED RADICAL-SCAVENGING PROPERTIES AND LOW ACUTE TOXICITY. OVERALL, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MEMBERS OF THIS NOVEL SERIES OF ESTERS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE GOOD CANDIDATES AS HCES1 OR HCES2 INHIBITORS FOR BIOMEDICINAL APPLICATIONS.

ITS DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY SHOWN TO POSSESS A WIDE RANGE OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING ANTHELMINTIC, ANTIHYPERTENSIVE, ANTIULCER, AS WELL AS ANTICHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SEARCH FOR MORE POTENT BENZIMIDAZOLE-BASED CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS, THROUGH THE MODIFICATION OF THE 1- AND 2-POSITIONS OF THE BENZIMIDAZOLE CORE. SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUNDS WERE CARRIED OUT VIA A 4-STEP REACTION SCHEME FOLLOWING A PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PROTOCOL. STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP OF THE COMPOUNDS ARE ESTABLISHED THROUGH IN VITRO CHOLINESTERASE ASSAYS AND IN SILICO DOCKING STUDIES. FURTHERMORE, CYTOTOXICITY AND BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) PERMEABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED. AMONG THE SYNTHESISED COMPOUNDS, THREE OF THEM (5IIA, 5IIB, AND 5IIC) EXHIBITED POTENT SELECTIVE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION AT LOW MICROMOLAR LEVEL. THE COMPOUNDS DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CYTOTOXICITY WHEN TESTED AGAINST A PANEL OF HUMAN CELL LINES. MOREOVER, THE MOST ACTIVE COMPOUND, 5IIC, WAS HIGHLY PERMEABLE ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. IN TOTAL 10 BENZIMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVES WERE SYNTHESIZED AND SCREENED FOR THEIR ACHE AND BUCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES. LEAD COMPOUND 5IIC, REPRESENTS A VALUABLE COMPOUND FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AS POTENTIAL AD THERAPEUTICS.

THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH THE GOAL OF FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) PERMISSION FOR A FIRST-IN-HUMAN CLINICAL TRIAL OF A GENE THERAPY FOR TREATMENT-SEEKING COCAINE USERS TO BECOME AND REMAIN ABSTINENT. THE APPROACH WAS BASED ON INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF AAV8-HCOCH, AN ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRAL VECTOR ENCODING A MODIFIED PLASMA ENZYME THAT METABOLIZES COCAINE INTO HARMLESS BY-PRODUCTS. TO ASSESS SYSTEMIC SAFETY, WE CONDUCTED "GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE" (GLP) STUDIES IN COCAINE-EXPERIENCED AND COCAINE-NAIVE MICE AT DOSES OF 5E12 AND 5E13 VECTOR GENOMES/KG. RESULTS SHOWED TOTAL LACK OF VIRAL VECTOR-RELATED ADVERSE EFFECTS IN ALL TESTS PERFORMED. INSTEAD, MICE GIVEN ONE INJECTION OF AAV8-HCOCH AND REGULAR DAILY INJECTIONS OF COCAINE HAD FAR LESS TISSUE PATHOLOGY THAN COCAINE-INJECTED MICE WITH NO VECTOR TREATMENT. BIODISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS SHOWED THE VECTOR LOCATED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN THE LIVER. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A LIVER-DIRECTED AAV8-HCOCH GENE TRANSFER AT REASONABLE DOSAGE IS SAFE, WELL TOLERATED, AND EFFECTIVE. THUS, GENE TRANSFER THERAPY EMERGES AS A RADICALLY NEW APPROACH TO TREAT COMPULSIVE COCAINE ABUSE. IN FACT, BASED ON THESE POSITIVE FINDINGS, THE FDA RECENTLY ACCEPTED OUR LATEST REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION (IND 18579).

PATIENTS WITH AD DISPLAY NEUROPATHOLOGICAL LESIONS INCLUDING SENILE PLAQUES, NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES, AND NEURONAL LOSS. THERE ARE NO DISEASE-MODIFYING DRUGS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. WITH THE NUMBER OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THERE IS OBVIOUS URGENT NEED FOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR AD. THE MULTIFACTORIAL NATURE OF AD ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPOUNDS, ABLE TO INTERACT WITH SEVERAL PUTATIVE TARGETS. HERE, WE HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF TWO IN-HOUSE DESIGNED CANNABINOID RECEPTORS (CB) AGONISTS SHOWING INHIBITORY ACTIONS ON Œ≤-SECRETASE-1 (BACE-1) (NP137) AND BACE-1/BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) (NP148), ON CELLULAR MODELS OF AD, INCLUDING IMMORTALIZED LYMPHOCYTES FROM LATE-ONSET AD PATIENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE PERFORMANCE OF TGAPP MICE IN A SPATIAL NAVIGATION TASK WAS INVESTIGATED FOLLOWING CHRONIC ADMINISTRATION OF NP137 AND NP148. WE REPORT HERE THAT NP137 AND NP148 SHOWED NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS IN AMYLOID-Œ≤-TREATED PRIMARY CORTICAL NEURONS, AND NP137 IN PARTICULAR RESCUED THE COGNITIVE DEFICIT OF TGAPP MICE. THE LATTER COMPOUND WAS ABLE TO BLUNT THE ABNORMAL CELL RESPONSE TO SERUM ADDITION OR WITHDRAWAL OF LYMPHOBLASTS DERIVED FROM AD PATIENTS.

WE EVALUATED THEIR POTENCY FOR REVERSIBLE INHIBITION AND REACTIVATION OF OP INHIBITED HUMAN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND EVALUATED INTERACTIONS BY MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES. THE REACTIVATION WAS NOTABLE FOR BOTH ACHE AND BCHE INHIBITED BY VX, CYCLOSARIN, SARIN AND PARAOXON, IF QUINUCLIDINIUM COMPOUNDS CONTAINED THE BENZYL GROUP ATTACHED TO THE QUINUCLIDINIUM MOIETY. OUT OF ALL 14, OXIME Q8 [4-BROMOBENZYL-3-(HYDROXYIMINO)QUINUCLIDINIUM BROMIDE] WAS SINGLED OUT AS HAVING THE HIGHEST DETERMINED OVERALL REACTIVATION RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 20,000¬†M ¬†MIN  FOR CYCLOSARIN-INHIBITED BCHE. FURTHERMORE, THIS OXIME IN COMBINATION WITH BCHE EXHIBITED A CAPABILITY TO ACT AS A BIOSCAVENGER OF CYCLOSARIN, DEGRADING WITHIN 2¬†H UP TO 100-FOLD EXCESS OF CYCLOSARIN CONCENTRATION OVER THE ENZYME. MOLECULAR MODELING REVEALED THAT THE POSITION OF THE CYCLOHEXYL MOIETY CONJUGATED WITH THE ACTIVE SITE SERINE OF BCHE DIRECTS THE FAVORABLE POSITIONING OF THE QUINUCLIDINIUM RING AND THE BROMOPHENYL MOIETY OF Q8, WHICH MAKES PHOSPHONYLATED-SERINE EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR THE NUCLEOPHILIC DISPLACEMENT BY THE OXIME GROUP OF Q8. THIS RESULT PRESENTS A NOVEL SCAFFOLD FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BCHE-BASED BIOSCAVENGERS. FURTHERMORE, A CYTOTOXIC EFFECT WAS NOT OBSERVED FOR Q8, WHICH ALSO MAKES IT PROMISING FOR FURTHER IN VIVO REACTIVATION STUDIES.

A DISADVANTAGE OF PLANT CELLS FROM A TRADITIONAL BATCH BIOPROCESSING PERSPECTIVE IS THEIR SLOW GROWTH RATE WHICH HAS MOTIVATED US TO DEVELOP SEMICONTINUOUS AND/OR PERFUSION PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF PLANT CELL CULTURE BIOPROCESSES ARE OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE LITERATURE, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE NO RIGOROUS TECHNOECONOMIC MODELS OR ANALYSES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. HERE WE PRESENT TECHNOECONOMIC MODELS IN SUPERPRO DESIGNER¬Æ FOR THE LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF RECOMBINANT BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), A PROPHYLACTIC/THERAPEUTIC BIOSCAVENGER AGAINST ORGANOPHOSPHATE NERVE AGENT POISONING, IN INDUCIBLE TRANSGENIC RICE CELL SUSPENSION CULTURES.

TWENTY SEVEN COMPOUNDS WERE COMPARED, INCLUDING ONES NOT PREVIOUSLY TESTED. AN ATTEMPT WAS UNDERTAKEN TO PRECISELY DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF ALCOHOL IN THE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. THIS PAPER UNDERLINES THE ROLE OF A "FALSE POSITIVE" BLANK SAMPLE IN THE ROUTINE ANALYSIS. THE INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASE WAS MEASURED USING ELLMAN'S COLORIMETRIC METHOD WITH A FEW MODIFICATIONS DESIGNED BY THE AUTHORS (INCLUDING THE "FALSE-POSITIVE" EFFECT). THE INHIBITORY ROLE OF ETHANOL AND METHANOL WAS ALSO CAREFULLY EVALUATED. THE PRESENT AND PAST RESULTS WERE COMPARED TAKING THE SOURCE OF ENZYME AND ALCOHOL CONTENT INTO CONSIDERATION. FOR THE FIRST TIME, NEW INHIBITORS WERE IDENTIFIED, NAMELY: METHYL JASMONATE, 1R-(-)-NOPOL ((ANTI-ACETYL-(ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITY)) AND 1,4-CINEOLE, ALLO-AROMADENDRENE, NEROLIDOL, Œ≤-IONONE, AND (R)-(+)-PULEGONE (ANTI-BCHE ACTIVITY). OLEANOLIC ACID AND (+)-Œ≤-CITRONELLENE (NOT PREVIOUSLY STUDIED) PROVED TO BE INEFFICIENT INHIBITORS. FOR A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN INHIBITORS (SUCH AS NEROL, (-)-MENTHOL, (+)-MENTHOL, ISOBORNEOL, (-)-BORNYL ACETATE, LIMONENE, Œ±-PINENE, Œ≤-PINENE, Œ±- IONONE, AND EUGENOL) SOME SERIOUS DISCREPANCIES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN OUR FINDINGS AND THE RESULTS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES. ETHANOL AND METHANOL SHOWED NO ANTI-ACHE ACTIVITY UP TO 0.29% (V/V) AND 0.23% (V/V), RESPECTIVELY. SIMILARLY, ETHANOL UP TO 0.33% (V/V) AND METHANOL UP TO 0.29% (V/V) DID NOT INHIBIT THE ACTIVITY OF BCHE. IT CAN BE STATED THAT THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL SHOULD BE PRECISELY DETERMINED AND THAT BLANK "FALSE-POSITIVE" SAMPLES SHOULD BE PROCESSED TOGETHER WITH TEST SAMPLES. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFECT OF THE ENZYME ORIGIN ON THE RESULT OF THIS TEST MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

IN VITRO CHOLINERGIC ENZYMES INHIBITION POTENTIAL OF ALL COMPOUNDS WAS TESTED. ENZYME INHIBITION ASSAYS SHOWED THAT SOME HYBRIDS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT POTENCY TO INHIBIT ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). ESPECIALLY, THE HYBRID COMPOUND 5N PRESENTED THE MORE EFFECTIVE INHIBITION AGAINST ACHE (4.24 ¬µM) WITH AN ACCEPTABLE SELECTIVITY INDEX VERSUS BCHE (SI: 5.19), WHILE COMPOUND 6AA EXHIBITED THE GREATEST INHIBITION ACTIVITY ON BCHE (3.97 ¬µM) AND A SIGNIFICANT SELECTIVITY INDEX AGAINST ACHE (SI: 0.04). KINETIC STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT FOR COMPOUNDS WITH GREATER INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF CHOLINESTERASES. STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS OF THE MOLECULAR HYBRIDS WERE ANALYZED, THROUGH COMPUTATIONAL MODELS USING A MOLECULAR CROSS-DOCKING ALGORITHM AND MOLECULAR MECHANICS/GENERALIZED BORN SURFACE AREA (MM/GBSA) BINDING FREE ENERGY APPROACH, WHICH INDICATED A GOOD CORRELATION BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL INHIBITION VALUES AND THE PREDICTED FREE BINDING ENERGY.

Schopfer", "Oksana Lockridge") Tetramer organizing polyproline-rich peptides identified by mass spectrometry after release of the peptides from Hupresin-purified butyrylcholinesterase tetramers isolated from milk of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) Data in Brief 2352-3409 20 1607-1619 2018 10.1016/j.dib.2018.08.109 Milk of the domestic pig has 10 times more butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) per mL than porcine serum. We purified BChE from porcine milk by affinity chromatography on Hupresin-Sepharose. The pure porcine BChE (PoBChE) was a tetramer with a molecular weight of 340,000, similar to that of human BChE tetramers. The C-terminal 40 residues of PoBChE constitute the tetramerization domain. The glue that holds the 4 BChE subunits together is a polyproline-rich peptide. Mass spectrometry analysis of trypsin-digested PoBChE identified a variety of polyproline-rich peptides originating from 12 different proteins. The donor proteins exist in the nucleus or cytoplasm of cells and contribute their polyproline-rich peptides after a cell is degraded. The secreted PoBChE scavenges the polyproline-rich peptides and incorporates one polyproline peptide per PoBChE tetramer, where the polyproline peptide is bound noncovalently but very tightly with an estimated dissociation constant of 10‚Äì12 M. The most abundant polyproline-rich peptides were derived from acrosin, homeobox protein HoxB4, lysine-specific demethylase 6B, proline-rich protein 12, and proline-rich membrane anchor 1 (PRiMA). The research article associated with the data in this report can be found in Saxena et al. (2018). The Data in Brief report lists all the polyproline-rich peptides identified in PoBChE tetramers.

MOLECULES 1420-3049 25 NA 2020 10.3390/molecules25245914 STEPHANIAE TETRANDRAE RADIX (STR) IS A COMMONLY USED TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE IN ALLEVIATING EDEMA BY INDUCING DIURESIS. IN THE CLINIC, STR EXTRACTS OR ITS COMPONENTS ARE WIDELY USED IN THE TREATMENT OF EDEMA, DYSURIA, AND RHEUMATISM FOR THE REGULATION OF WATER METABOLISM. FURTHERMORE, STR HAS BEEN USED IN TREATING EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS FOR YEARS BY COMBINING WITH OTHER CHINESE HERBS. HOWEVER, THE MATERIAL BASIS AND MECHANISM OF STR ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HAVE NOT BEEN REVEALED. HERE, THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF STR EXTRACTS WITH DIFFERENT EXTRACTING SOLVENTS WERE IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING THREE MAJOR ALKALOIDS, I.E., CYCLANOLINE, FANGCHINOLINE, AND TETRANDRINE. THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF STR EXTRACTS AND ITS ALKALOIDS WAS DETERMINED USING THE ELLMAN ASSAY. BOTH CYCLANOLINE AND FANGCHINOLINE SHOWED ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) INHIBITORY ACTIVITY, DEMONSTRATING NONCOMPETITIVE ENZYME INHIBITION. IN CONTRAST, TETRANDRINE DID NOT SHOW ENZYMATIC INHIBITION. THE SYNERGISM OF STR ALKALOIDS WITH HUPERZINE A OR DONEPEZIL WAS CALCULATED BY THE MEDIAN-EFFECT PRINCIPLE. THE DRUG COMBINATION OF FANGCHINOLINE-HUPERZINE A OR DONEPEZIL SYNERGISTICALLY INHIBITED ACHE, HAVING A COMBINATION INDEX (CI) < 1 AT   = 0.5. FURTHERMORE, THE MOLECULAR DOCKING RESULTS SHOWED THAT FANGCHINOLINE BOUND WITH ACHE RESIDUES IN THE PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE, AND CYCLANOLINE BOUND WITH ACHE RESIDUES IN THE PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE, ANIONIC SITE, AND CATALYTIC SITE. IN PARALLEL, CYCLANOLINE BOUND WITH BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) RESIDUES IN THE ANIONIC SITE, CATALYTIC SITE, AND AROMATIC SITE. THE RESULTS SUPPORT THAT FANGCHINOLINE AND CYCLANOLINE, ALKALOIDS DERIVED FROM STR, COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE ANTI-ACHE FUNCTION OF STR. THUS, STR EXTRACT OR ITS ALKALOIDS MAY POTENTIALLY BE DEVELOPED AS A THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS.

This innovative carrier was in the form of spherical pellets containing different amounts of Neusilin. Neusilin is a synthetic and amorphous form of magnesium aluminometasilicate with a high specific surface area, and the immobilized enzyme butyrylcholinesterase with an activity of 50nkat¬∑g‚àí1. Pellets were prepared by the extrusion-spheronization method and dried in a hot air oven under two conditions ‚Äì at 30¬∞C for 72h and at 60¬∞C for 24h. Dried pellets were consequently impregnated with a solution containing butyrylcholinesterase. Impregnated pellets were evaluated for their quality parameters, enzymatic activity and inhibition. Activity and inhibition were tested according to the standard Ellman's method. It was observed that the addition of Neusilin significantly increased the hardness, intraparticular porosity, sphericity and activity of the carriers as well as intensity of the color transition. Therefore it is shown that these carriers have unquestionable advantages over common carriers of their kind. Drying temperatures have been shown to have no effect on properties of pellets except for a change in their size. Results were confirmed by statistical evaluation using ANOVA and PCA.

PARAOXONASE-1 (PON-1) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS SIGNIFICANT BIOMARKERS TO MONITOR SUCH DISORDERS IN HUMAN SEPTIC PATIENTS. WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF PON-1 AND BCHE VS OTHER TRADITIONAL ACUTE-PHASE PROTEINS SUCH AS ALBUMIN (ALB) AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP) IN SEPTIC DOGS. THIS PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY INCLUDED 20 DOGS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF SEPSIS, 27 WITH LOW-GRADE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION (LGSI), AND 10 HEALTHY DOGS THAT SERVED AS CONTROLS. PLASMA SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED FROM ALL DOGS FOR ANALYSIS ON ADMISSION, AND THEN EVERY 24-48¬†HOURS UNTIL DISCHARGE OR DEATH IN THE SEPTIC GROUP. DOGS WITH SEPSIS HAD LOWER PON-1 ACTIVITY COMPARED WITH DOGS IN THE LGSI GROUP (1.1¬†¬±¬†0.10 VS 1.6¬†¬±¬†0.08 U/ML, P¬†=¬†.002), BUT NO DIFFERENCES IN BCHE ACTIVITY WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE GROUPS. PON-1, ALB, AND CRP COULD SUCCESSFULLY DISCRIMINATE HEALTHY ANIMALS FROM THOSE WITH SEPSIS LOOKING AT THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) OF THE RECEIVER OPERATOR CHARACTERISTICS CURVES (ROCS), WHICH WERE 0.828, 0.903 AND 1.000, RESPECTIVELY. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AMONG THE GROUPS FOR PON-1 OR BCHE ACTIVITY, THE NONSURVIVOR SEPTIC DOGS HAD HIGHER CRP (P¬†=¬†.002), LOWER ALB (P¬†=¬†.025) LEVELS, AND TENDED TO HAVE LOWER PON-1 (P¬†=¬†.082) ACTIVITIES THAN THE SURVIVORS AT PATIENT DEATH OR DISCHARGE. SEPTIC DOGS SHOWED LOWER PLASMA PON-1 AND HIGHER BCHE ACTIVITIES, BUT ONLY PON-1 ACTIVITY CORRELATED WITH DISEASE SEVERITY. FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED TO DESCRIBE THE USEFULNESS OF THESE NEW BIOMARKERS OF SEPSIS PROGRESSION AND RECOVERY IN DOGS.

SINCE THE COMPATIBILITY OF CLINICAL BIOMARKERS WITH GAMMA IRRADIATION IS NOT WELL CHARACTERIZED, A SUBSET OF DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS RANGING IN MOLECULAR SIZE, CONCENTRATION, AND CLINICAL MATRIX WAS ANALYZED TO DETERMINE RECOVERY FOLLOWING GAMMA IRRADIATION. SAMPLE IRRADIATION OF PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERIZED QUALITY CONTROL MATERIALS (QCS) AT 5¬ÄâMRAD WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE GAMMA CELL IRRADIATION FACILITY AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) IN ATLANTA, GA. FOLLOWING IRRADIATION, THE QCS WERE ANALYZED ALONGSIDE NON-IRRADIATED QCS TO DETERMINE ANALYTE RECOVERY BETWEEN DOSED AND CONTROL SAMPLES. BIOMARKERS FOR EXPOSURE TO ABRIN, RICIN, AND ORGANOPHOSPHORUS NERVE AGENTS (OPNAS) WERE ANALYZED FOR THEIR STABILITY FOLLOWING GAMMA IRRADIATION. THE DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS INCLUDED ADDUCTS TO BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, ABRINE, AND RICININE, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE RECOVERED AT OVER 90% OF THEIR INITIAL CONCENTRATION. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PILOT STUDY SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN IRRADIATIVE STERILIZATION PROTOCOL FOR POSSIBLE MIXED-EXPOSURE SAMPLES CONTAINING BOTH CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL THREAT AGENTS (MIXED CBTS). FURTHERMORE, IRRADIATIVE STERILIZATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES A LABORATORIAN'S RISK OF INFECTION FROM EXPOSURE TO AN INFECTIOUS AGENT WITHOUT COMPROMISING CHEMICAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTING INTEGRITY, PARTICULARLY FOR DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS IN WHICH THE CHEMICAL ANALYTE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE FULLY CONSERVED FOLLOWING A 5¬ÄâMRAD IRRADIATIVE DOSE.

HUMAN CELLS PRODUCE GLYCOPROTEINS THAT INCLUDE Œ±-2,3 AND Œ±-2,6 SIALIC ACIDS. TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ALTERING PROTEIN SIALYLATION ON PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, RECOMBINANT HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WAS PRODUCED IN CHO CELLS BY KNOCKING OUT THE Œ±-2,3 SIALYLTRANSFERASE GENES FOLLOWED BY OVEREXPRESSION OF THE Œ±-2,6 SIALYLTRANSFERASE (26BCHE) ENZYME. THE N-GLYCAN COMPOSITION OF 26BCHE WAS COMPARED TO BCHE WITH Œ±-2,3 SIALYLATION (23BCHE) DERIVED FROM WILD-TYPE CHO CELLS. BOTH 23BCHE AND 26BCHE EXHIBITED COMPARABLE ANTENNARITY DISTRIBUTIONS WITH BI-ANTENNARY DI-SIALYLATED GLYCANS REPRESENTING THE MOST ABUNDANT GLYCOFORM. CD-1 MICE WERE INTRAVENOUSLY INJECTED WITH THE 23BCHE OR 26BCHE, AND RESIDUAL BCHE ACTIVITIES FROM BLOOD COLLECTED AT VARIOUS TIME POINTS FOR PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES. ALTHOUGH 23BCHE CONTAINED A SLIGHTLY LOWER INITIAL SIALYLATION LEVEL COMPARED TO 26BCHE, THE MOLECULE EXHIBITED HIGHER RESIDUAL ACTIVITY BETWEEN 5 AND 24¬ÄâHR POSTINJECTION. PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES INDICATED THAT 23BCHE EXHIBITED AN INCREASE IN AREA UNDER THE CURVE AND A LOWER VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION AT STEADY STATE THAN THAT OF 26BCHE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE TYPE OF SIALYLATION LINKAGE MAY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE PHARMACOKINETIC BEHAVIOR OF A BIOTHERAPEUTIC WHEN TESTED IN IN VIVO ANIMAL MODELS.

Phenazines are used as electron acceptors-donors in wide range of fields including environmental biosensors. In this study, the inhibitory effects of a synthetic phenazine dye, methylene violet 3RAX (also known as diethyl safranine) on human erythrocyte AChE and human plasma BChE were tested and also its inhibitory mechanisms for both enzymes were studied in detail. Kinetic analyses showed that methylene violet 3RAX acts as a hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibitor of AChE with Ki value of 1.58‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.36‚ÄØŒºM; Œ±‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1; Œ≤‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.12‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.0003. On the other hand, it caused linear competitive inhibition of BChE with Ki value of 0.51‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.006‚ÄØŒºM; Œ±‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ‚àû. In conclusion, methylene violet 3RAX which is a highly effective inhibitor of both human AChE and human BChE with Ki values in low micromolar range may be a promising candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Jure Stojan The mechanism and benefit of human butyrylcholinesterase activation by what would otherwise be inhibitors Chemico-Biological Interactions 0009-2797 308 350-356 2019 10.1016/j.cbi.2019.06.005 Activation of human butyrylcholinesterase by small quaternary ammonium ions is known. Here, additional ligands in this series are presented: edrophonium and choline, and the reactivator pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride. Kinetic analysis of the progress curves with these compounds indicates the mechanism of enhanced deacylation by the ligand bound to the catalytic anionic site (Trp82) at the base of the active site. The larger, bis-quaternary ligands examined, as propidium, hexamethonium, decamethonium, and bis-thiocholine, show only competitive inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase, by preventing substrate approach. This hypothesis of enhanced deacylation was tested for reactivation of methanesulfonylfluoride-inactivated butyrylcholinesterase, a complex analogous to organophosphate-aged cholinesterases. The combination of substrate/products and pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride improved butyrylcholinesterase activity over 2‚ÄØh of continuous measurements, before which time substrate depletion prevailed. Similar reactivation of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase was unsuccessful, but both of these cholinesterases regain some activity if they have been inhibited and aged for days by diisopropylfluorophosphate.
SILMAN I THE MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL ROLES OF THE CHOLINESTERASES. PROG BIOPHYS MOL BIOL 1873-1732 NA NA 2020 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.12.001 IT IS TACITLY ASSUMED THAT THE BIOLOGICAL ROLE OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE IS TERMINATION OF SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION AT CHOLINERGIC SYNAPSES. HOWEVER, TOGETHER WITH ITS STRUCTURAL HOMOLOG, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, IT IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND, IN MANY CASES, THE ROLE OF BOTH ENZYMES REMAINS OBSCURE. THE TRANSIENT APPEARANCE OF THE CHOLINESTERASES IN EMBRYONIC TISSUES IS ESPECIALLY ENIGMATIC. THE TWO ENZYMES' EXTRA-SYNAPTIC ROLES, WHICH ARE KNOWN AS 'NON-CLASSICAL' ROLES, ARE THE TOPIC OF THIS REVIEW. STRONG EVIDENCE HAS BEEN PRESENTED THAT ACHE AND BCHE PLAY MORPHOGENETIC ROLES IN A VARIETY OF EUKARYOTIC SYSTEMS, AND THEY DO SO EITHER BY ACTING AS ADHESION PROTEINS, OR AS TROPHIC FACTORS. AS TROPHIC FACTORS, ONE MODE OF ACTION IS TO DIRECTLY REGULATE MORPHOGENESIS, SUCH AS NEURITE OUTGROWTH, BY POORLY UNDERSTOOD MECHANISMS. THE OTHER MODE IS BY REGULATING LEVELS OF ACETYLCHOLINE, WHICH ACTS AS THE DIRECT TROPHIC FACTOR. ALTERNATE SUBSTRATES HAVE BEEN SOUGHT FOR THE CHOLINESTERASES. QUITE RECENTLY, IT WAS SHOWN THAT LEVELS OF THE AGGRESSION HORMONE, GHRELIN, WHICH ALSO CONTROLS APPETITE, ARE REGULATED BY BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE. THE RAPID HYDROLYSIS OF ACETYLCHOLINE BY ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE GENERATES HIGH LOCAL PROTON CONCENTRATIONS. THE POSSIBLE BIOPHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS EFFECT ARE DISCUSSED. THE BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASES SECRETED BY PARASITIC NEMATODES IS REVIEWED, AND, FINALLY, THE INVOLVEMENT OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE IN APOPTOSIS IS CONSIDERED.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND TOXICITY OF METHANOL (MEOH) AND DICHLOROMETHANE (DCM) EXTRACTS OF A. ARVENSIS (AERIAL AND ROOT PARTS). BIOACTIVE CONTENTS WERE ASSESSED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY, AND THE SECONDARY METABOLITES WERE IDENTIFIED BY UHPLC-MS ANALYSIS. DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC, PHOSPHOMOLYBDENUM, AND METAL CHELATING ASSAYS WERE EMPLOYED TO ASSESS ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY. INHIBITORY POTENTIAL AGAINST KEY ENZYMES (Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, UREASE, LIPOXYGENASE (LOX), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE)) WERE ALSO ASSESSED. MTT ASSAY WAS EMPLOYED TO TEST TOXICITY AGAINST SW-480, MDA-MB-231, CASKI, MCF-7, AND DU-145 CANCER CELL LINES. METHANOLIC EXTRACTS SHOWED HIGHEST PHENOLIC (AERIAL-MEOH: 27.5¬†MG GAE/G EXTRACT; ROOT-MEOH: 21.17¬†MG GAE/G EXTRACT) AND FLAVONOID (AERIAL-MEOH: 26.15¬†MG QE/G EXTRACT; ROOT-MEOH: 19.07¬†MG QE/G EXTRACT) CONTENTS, AND POTENT ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES. THE AERIAL-MEOH EXTRACT WAS MOST POTENT FOR DPPH (IC : 231 UG/ML), ABTS (131.12¬†MG TE/G EXTRACT), FRAP (82.97¬†MG TE/G EXTRACT), AND CUPRAC (137.15¬†MG TE/G EXTRACT) ANTIOXIDANT ASSAYS. ALL EXTRACTS WERE CYTOTOXIC TOWARDS TESTED CANCER CELLS WITH IC  VALUES RANGING FROM 12.57 TO 294.5¬†¬µG/ML AND CONFERRED A COMPARATIVELY STRONG INHIBITION AGAINST Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE (AERIAL-DCM EXTRACT SHOWED THE HIGHEST INHIBITION AGAINST Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE WITH IC  VALUE OF 20.97¬†¬µG /ML), WHILE AERIAL EXTRACTS WERE ALSO CONSIDERABLY ACTIVE AGAINST BCHE (AERIAL-MEOH IC : 224.63¬†¬µG /ML), LOX (AERIAL-DCM IC : 385.7¬†¬µG /ML). LIKEWISE, AERIAL-MEOH EXTRACT WAS MOST ACTIVE AGAINST UREASE ENZYME (IC : 129.72¬†¬µG /ML). UHPLC-MS INVESTIGATION OF METHANOLIC EXTRACTS SHOWED THE EXISTENCE OF IMPORTANT PHENOLICS, FLAVONOIDS, AND SAPONINS, INCLUDING METHYL GALLTE, QUERCETIN, LANCEOLETIN, AND BALANITESIN, AMONGST OTHERS. MOREOVER, PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) HIGHLIGHTED THE CORRELATION AMONGST BIOACTIVE CONTENTS AND OBSERVED BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. A. ARVENSIS EXTRACTS COULD BE REGARDED AS A NATURAL SOURCE OF BIOACTIVE ANTIOXIDANTS, ENZYME INHIBITORS AND ANTICANCER AGENTS AND CAN BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED AS A LEAD SOURCE FOR FOOD AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES TO ISOLATE, PURIFY, AND TO CHARACTERIZE ITS BIOACTIVE PHYTOCHEMICALS ARE NEEDED.

RESULTS SHOW THAT THE IPSC-DERIVED NEURONS AND ASTROCYTES DIRECTLY INTERACTED AND FORMED SYNAPSES IN THE 3D MATRIX, AND THAT TREATMENT WITH BUCHE IMPROVED VIABILITY AFTER MT EXPOSURE UP TO A CONCENTRATION OF 10-3 M. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE 3D BRAIN-ON-CHIP PLATFORM WITH HUMAN IPSC-DERIVED BRAIN CELLS IS A SUITABLE MODEL TO STUDY THE NEUROTOXICITY OF OP EXPOSURE AND EVALUATE THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS FOR TREATMENT.

ACTA ANAESTHESIOL SCAND 1399-6576 65 182-187 2020 10.1111/aas.13718 VARIANTS OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ARE FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGED RESPONSE TO SUXAMETHONIUM OR MIVACURIUM. BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) CAN BE CHARACTERIZED BY PHENOTYPING AND DETERMINATION OF GENOTYPE. INAPPROPRIATE TIMING OF BLOOD SAMPLING MIGHT INTERFERE WITH PHENOTYPING METHODS. HOWEVER, GUIDELINES REGARDING DELAY BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO ANAESTHESIA AND TESTING ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED. IN THIS STUDY, THE BCHE ACTIVITY AND PHENOTYPE IN AN EARLY (T1) AND LATE (T2) PHASE WERE COMPARED AND THE PHENOTYPE/GENOTYPE CORRELATION WAS ASSESSED. PATIENTS WITH A PROLONGED PARALYSIS AFTER MIVACURIUM OR SUXAMETHONIUM WERE SELECTED AFTER ETHICAL COMMITTEE APPROVAL AND WRITTEN CONSENT. BCHE ACTIVITY WAS BASED ON BUTYRYLTHIOCHOLINE HYDROLYSIS RATE AND PHENOTYPING ON DIFFERENTIAL INHIBITION OF BCHE ACTIVITY WITH DIBUCAINE AND FLUORIDE. DNA SEQUENCING ALLOWED GENOTYPIC CHARACTERIZATION. WE INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF 20 PATIENTS WITH PROLONGED NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCK (NMB) INDUCED BY MIVACURIUM OR SUXAMETHONIUM. IN THESE PATIENTS, BCHE ACTIVITY WAS DIFFERENT AT T1 AND T2 (2120 [1506-2733] U¬†L  AND 4055 [2810-5301] U¬†L  , RESPECTIVELY; P¬†=¬†0.0014; VALUES ARE MEAN [95% CI]). WHEN PHENOTYPING WAS POSSIBLE, PHENOTYPING AT T1 AND T2 YIELDED IDENTICAL RESULTS. PHENOTYPING FAILED TO IDENTIFY ONE NEW VARIANT (P.TYR146CYS) AND THE K VARIANT IN 14 OF 16 PATIENTS. ANAESTHESIA INTERFERED WITH BCHE ACTIVITY, BUT NOT WITH PHENOTYPING. PHENOTYPING CAN BE PERFORMED ON BLOOD DRAWN DURING OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECOVERY OF MIVACURIUM OR SUXAMETHONIUM TO SCREEN FOR CLINICALLY RELEVANT VARIANTS OF BCHE. HOWEVER, ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF BCHE DEFICIENCY NEEDS FURTHER CONFIRMATION BY DETERMINATION OF GENOTYPE.

J BASIC CLIN PHYSIOL PHARMACOL 2191-0286 31 NA 2019 10.1515/jbcpp-2019-0220 BACKGROUND IN THIS STUDY, GREWIA OPTIVA DRUMMOND EX BURRET ROOT EXTRACTS WERE ASSESSED FOR USE AS A REMEDY FOR OXIDATIVE STRESS, DIABETES MELLITUS AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. METHODS THE ANTIOXIDATIVE POTENTIALS OF THE EXTRACTS WERE DETERMINED USING DPPH AND ABTS ASSAYS, WHEREAS THEIR ENZYME INHIBITORY POTENTIALS WERE DETERMINED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE AND Œ±-AMYLASE. IN THE IN VIVO EXPERIMENTS, METHANOL EXTRACT WAS ORALLY ADMINISTERED TO MICE (N = 5) AT FOUR DOSES OF 200, 300, 400 AND 500 MG KG-1 FOR 30 DAYS AND ITS EFFECT ON GLUCOSE, TRIGLYCERIDES, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, ETC. WERE INVESTIGATED. RESULTS THE HIGHEST FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING ACTIVITIES AGAINST DPPH AND ABTS RADICALS WERE RECORDED FOR THE METHANOL AND ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACTS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE IC50 VALUES WERE 75 AND 88 ŒºG/ML. IN ADDITION, THESE TWO FRACTIONS WERE HIGHLY ACTIVE IN INHIBITING ACHE AND BCHE, WITH IC50 VALUES OF 120 AND 185 ŒºG/ML, RESPECTIVELY. MODERATE INHIBITION (ŒºG/ML) WAS RECORDED AGAINST Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE (69.02 ¬± 1.02 AND 64.29 ¬± 2.41) AND Œ±-AMYLASE (65.12 ¬± 2.02 AND 63.29 ¬± 1.41) AND THESE WERE COMPARABLE TO THE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES EXHIBITED BY THE STANDARD, ACARBOSE. ALL THE EXTRACTS SHOWED HIGH PHENOLIC AND FLAVONOID CONTENTS, WHICH CORRELATED WITH THEIR ANTIOXIDANT, ANTICHOLINESTERASE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE AND Œ±-AMYLASE ACTIVITIES. THE PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS IN THE CRUDE EXTRACT AND FRACTIONS WERE DETERMINED USING THE STANDARD HPLC METHOD AND BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS, NAMELY, MORIN, ELLAGIC ACID, KAEMPFEROL-3-(P-COUMAROYL-DIGLUCOSIDE)-7-GLUCOSIDE, APIGENIN-7-O-RUTINOSIDE, QUERCETIN-3-(CAFFEOYL-DIGLUCOSIDE)-7-GLUCOSIDE, ETC., WHICH WERE DETECTED AT VARIOUS RETENTION TIMES. SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE AND BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSION G. OPTIVA IS A GOOD SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS AND OTHER PHYTOCHEMICALS, SOME OF WHICH POSSESS ANTICHOLINESTERASE, ANTI-GLUCOSIDASE, AND ANTI-AMYLASE ACTIVITIES, AND CAN BE USED TO TREAT DIFFERENT HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS OXIDATIVE STRESS, NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, AND DIABETES MELLITUS.

These detectors contain carriers in the form of pellets with immobilized cholinesterase, substrate and detection reagent. Their advantages are portability, sensitivity and simplicity, enabling fast detection of such compounds from air and water in case of a terrorist attack or war. In general, maintaining the stability of an enzyme for a longer time is very problematic; therefore, its further enhancement is required for safety and financial reasons. In this study, the stability of our patented carriers in the form of pellets with immobilized butyrylcholinesterase containing an increasing amount of the unique sorbent Neusilin¬Æ US2 was evaluated. The samples containing Neusilin maintained the stability of the immobilized enzyme for a longer time even at higher temperature and humidity than the currently commercially used carrier without Neusilin, allowing improved detection of nerve agents.

STRONG NUCLEOPHILES, SUCH AS OXIMES, HAVE BEEN USED AS THERAPEUTIC REACTIVATORS OF CHOLINESTERASE-ORGANOPHOSPHATE COMPLEXES, BUT SUFFER FROM SHORT HALF-LIVES AND LIMITED EFFICACY ACROSS THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE NERVE AGENTS. CHOLINESTERASES HAVE BEEN USED AS LONG-LIVED THERAPEUTIC BIOSCAVENGERS FOR UNREACTED ORGANOPHOSPHATES WITH LIMITED SUCCESS BECAUSE THEY REACT WITH ORGANOPHOSPHATE NERVE AGENTS WITH ONE-TO-ONE STOICHIOMETRIES. THE CHEMICAL POWER OF NUCLEOPHILIC REACTIVATORS IS COUPLED TO LONG-LIVED BIOSCAVENGERS BY DESIGNING AND SYNTHESIZING CHOLINESTERASE-POLYMER-OXIME CONJUGATES USING ATOM TRANSFER RADICAL POLYMERIZATION AND AZIDE-ALKYNE "CLICK" CHEMISTRY. DETAILED KINETIC STUDIES SHOW THAT BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE-POLYMER-OXIME ACTIVITY IS DEPENDENT ON THE ELECTROSTATIC PROPERTIES OF THE POLYMERS AND THE AMOUNT OF OXIME WITHIN THE CONJUGATE. THE COVALENT COUPLING OF OXIME-CONTAINING POLYMERS TO THE SURFACE OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE SLOWS THE RATE OF INACTIVATION OF PARAOXON, A MODEL NERVE AGENT. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE ENZYME IS COVALENTLY INHIBITED BY PARAOXON, THE COVALENTLY ATTACHED OXIME INDUCED INTER- AND INTRAMOLECULAR REACTIVATION. INTRAMOLECULAR REACTIVATION WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO THE GENERATION OF A NEW CLASS OF NERVE AGENT SCAVENGERS THAT COUPLE THE SPEED AND SELECTIVITY OF BIOLOGY TO THE RUGGEDNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS.

J PHARM PHARMACOL 2042-7158 72 1001-1012 2019 10.1111/jphp.13244 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) IS ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS AND A WELL-RECOGNIZED CAUSE OF DEMENTIA WITH AGEING. IN THIS REVIEW, WE HAVE REPRESENTED THE CHE AND MAO INHIBITORY POTENTIAL OF TV 3326 AGAINST AD BASED ON CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. THE AETIOLOGY OF AD IS QUITE COMPLEX AND NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT AD INVOLVES THE DEPOSITION OF ABNORMAL AMYLOID BETA (AŒ≤), ALONG WITH HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION OF TAU, OXIDATIVE STRESS, LOW ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH) LEVEL AND BIOMETAL DYSHOMEOSTASIS. DUE TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF AD AETIOLOGY, ACTIVE RESEARCH IS REQUIRED IN THE AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT OF MULTITARGET DRUGS WITH 2 OR MORE COMPLEMENTARY BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, AS THEY MIGHT REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE AD TREATMENT. INTERESTINGLY, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT TV 3326 (I.E. LADOSTIGIL) IS REGARDED AS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AGENT SINCE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE INHIBITION OF MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) A AND B, AND ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) IN THE BRAIN. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS THE CAPACITY TO REVERSE MEMORY IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH FURTHER SUGGESTS THE ABILITY OF THIS DRUG TO ELEVATE CHOLINERGIC ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN. TV 3326 CAN AVERT OXIDATIVE-NITRATIVE STRESS AND GLIOSIS. IT HAS ALSO BEEN CONFIRMED THAT TV 3326 CONTAINS NEUROPROTECTIVE AND ANTI-APOPTOTIC PROPERTIES. THEREFORE, THIS DISTINCTIVE COMBINED INHIBITION OF CHE AND MAO¬†ALONG WITH ITS NEUROPROTECTIVE PROPERTY MAKES TV 3326 A USEFUL DRUG IN THE TREATMENT OF AD.

J PHARM BIOMED ANAL 1873-264X 179 113004 2019 10.1016/j.jpba.2019.113004 PELLETS WITH AN IMMOBILIZED ENZYME (ACETYL- OR BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE) ARE THE UP-TO-DATE TYPE OF CARRIERS USED FOR THE DETECTION OF NERVE AGENTS (SOMAN, SARIN, TABUN, VX, NOVICHOK) AND OTHER CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS SUCH AS ORGANOPHOSPHATE AND CARBAMATE INSECTICIDES (PARATHION, MALATHION). THEY ARE USED IN THE GLASS DETECTION TUBES AS A LAYER CONTAINING THE ENZYME TOGETHER WITH THE SECOND LAYER, WHICH CONTAINS A COLORIMETRIC REAGENT AND SUBSTRATE. THE DETECTION METHOD IS BASED ON THE VISUALLY OR SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY OBSERVABLE ELLMAN'S REACTION, WHICH DEVELOPS A YELLOW COLOR IN THE ABSENCE OF THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR; OTHERWISE, THE DETECTOR PRESERVES ITS ORIGINAL COLOR (PREFERABLY WHITE). THIS REACTION OCCURS VERY FAST AND HAS A HIGH SENSITIVITY TO NERVE AGENTS BUT IT SUFFERS FROM AN INDISTINCTIVE COLOR TRANSITION FROM WHITE TO YELLOW. IN THE PRESENTED STUDY, A NEW APPROACH WITH THE USE OF THE SYNERGIC EFFECT OF MAGNESIUM ALUMINOMETASILICATE WITH A HIGH SURFACE AREA MARKETED AS NEUSILIN¬ÆUS2 AND A PROTECTIVE SEMIPERMEABLE EUDRAGIT¬Æ RL LAYER WAS UTILIZED. THE PREPARED PELLETS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR THEIR PROPERTIES SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF THE ENZYME, INTENSITY OF THE DEVELOPED YELLOW COLOR, SENSITIVITY TO CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR PHYSOSTIGMINE, WHICH ACTS AS A NERVE AGENT SIMULANT, AND PHYSICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS HARDNESS, PYCNOMETRIC DENSITY AND SPHERICITY. AFTER THE INITIAL EVALUATION, ALL SAMPLES UNDERWENT A STABILITY TEST UNDER THREE DIFFERENT STORAGE CONDITIONS FOR 24 MONTHS DURING WHICH THEY WERE EVALUATED AT GIVEN TIME POINTS (0, 3, 6, 12 AND 24 MONTHS). IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PREPARED SAMPLES ACHIEVED A MUCH HIGHER INTENSITY OF DEVELOPED YELLOW COLOR THAN IN THE PUBLISHED STUDIES WHILE MAINTAINING SIMILAR OR BETTER SENSITIVITY, SPEED OF DETECTION AND SUITABLE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES.

IN THIS RESPECT, POLYPHENOLIC PROFILES WERE EVALUATED USING ULTRAHIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-QUADRUPOLE TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY. THE IN VITRO ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES OF THE CRATAEGUS SAMPLES WERE EVALUATED BY USING FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGING, PHOSPHOMOLYBDENUM, FERROUS-ION CHELATING, AND REDUCING POWER ASSAYS. THE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, AMYLASE, CHOLINESTERASES (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE)), AND TYROSINASE WERE ALSO ESTABLISHED. THE UNTARGETED METABOLOMIC APPROACH HIGHLIGHTED THE EFFECT OF BOTH EXTRACTION TYPES AND SPECIES ON THE PHENOLIC PROFILES OF DIFFERENT CRATEAGUS TISSUES (I.E. LEAVES AND TWIGS). THE METHANOLIC EXTRACTS SHOWED THE MAXIMUM RADICAL SCAVENGING AND REDUCING ACTIVITY IN ALL TEST SYSTEMS, WHEREAS FOR FERROUS-ION CHELATING ASSAYS THE DECOCTED AND INFUSED EXTRACTS SHOWED THE HIGHEST ACTIVITY. ONLY THE METHANOLIC EXTRACTS WERE EFFECTIVE AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE. THE EXTRACT TESTED SHOWED REMARKABLE INHIBITORY EFFECTS AGAINST TYROSINASE AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, WHEREAS ALL THE EXTRACTS EXHIBITED MODEST INHIBITION AGAINST Œ±-AMYLASE. OVERALL, THE TWIG EXTRACTS OF THE THREE SPECIES STUDIED SHOWED SUPERIOR ANTIOXIDANT AND ENZYME INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES. ON THE BASIS OF THESE RESULTS, THE THREE CRATAEGUS SPECIES CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS POTENT BIORESOURCES FOR HIGH-VALUE PHYTOCHEMICALS, WHICH WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS FOR DEVELOPING NOVEL NUTRACEUTICALS. ¬© 2019 SOCIETY OF CHEMICAL INDUSTRY.

VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS (VH) ARE MORE COMMON IN DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES (DLB). IN AUTOPSY STUDIES, UP TO 60% OF PATIENTS WITH AD HAVE CONCOMITANT LEWY BODY PATHOLOGY. DECREASED PERFUSION OF THE OCCIPITAL LOBE HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN DLB PATIENTS WITH VH, AND POST-MORTEM STUDIES POINT TO BOTH DECREASED CHOLINERGIC ACTIVITY AND REDUCED OXYGENATION OF THE OCCIPITAL CORTEX IN DLB. WE USED BIOCHEMICAL METHODS TO ASSESS MICROVESSEL DENSITY (LEVEL OF VON WILLEBRAND FACTOR, A MARKER OF ENDOTHELIAL CELL CONTENT), ANTE-MORTEM OXYGENATION (VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR, A MARKER OF TISSUE HYPOXIA; MYELIN-ASSOCIATED GLYCOPROTEIN TO PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN-1 RATIO, A MEASURE OF TISSUE OXYGENATION RELATIVE TO METABOLIC DEMAND), CHOLINERGIC INNERVATION (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND CHOLINE ACETYLTRANSFERASE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE AND INSOLUBLE Œ±-SYNUCLEIN CONTENT IN THE BA18 AND BA19 OCCIPITAL CORTEX OBTAINED POST-MORTEM FROM 23 AD PATIENTS WHO HAD EXPERIENCED VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS, 19 AD PATIENTS WITHOUT HALLUCINATIONS, 19 DLB PATIENTS, AND 36 CONTROLS. THE COHORTS WERE MATCHED FOR AGE, GENDER AND POST-MORTEM INTERVAL. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF REDUCED MICROVESSEL DENSITY, HYPOPERFUSION OR REDUCTION IN CHAT ACTIVITY IN AD WITH VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS. ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY WAS REDUCED IN BOTH BA18 AND BA19, IN ALL 3 DEMENTIA GROUPS, AND THE CONCENTRATION WAS ALSO REDUCED IN BA19 IN THE DLB AND AD WITHOUT VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS GROUPS. INSOLUBLE Œ±-SYNUCLEIN WAS RAISED IN THE DLB GROUP IN BOTH AREAS BUT NOT IN AD EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS IN AD ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHOLINERGIC DENERVATION RATHER THAN CHRONIC HYPOPERFUSION OR Œ±-SYNUCLEIN ACCUMULATION IN VISUAL PROCESSING AREAS OF THE OCCIPITAL CORTEX.

AS THE RESULTS INDICATE, ALL COMPOUNDS REVERSIBLY INHIBITED BOTH ENZYMES IN THE MICROMOLAR RANGE POINTING TO THE PREFERENCE OF ACHE OVER BCHE FOR BINDING THE TESTED DERIVATIVES. MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERACTIONS WITH ACHE ACTIVE SITE RESIDUES TYR337 AND TYR124, WHICH DICTATED MOST OF THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES. THE MOST POTENT INHIBITOR OF BOTH ENZYMES WITH   OF 4 ŒºM FOR ACHE AND 8 ŒºM FOR BCHE WAS THE NICOTINAMIDE DERIVATIVE 1-(4'-PHENYLPHENACYL)-3-CARBAMOYLPYRIDINIUM BROMIDE. SUCH A RESULT PLACES IT WITHIN THE RANGE OF SEVERAL CURRENTLY STUDIED NOVEL CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. CYTOTOXICITY PROFILING DID NOT CLASSIFY THIS COMPOUND AS HIGHLY TOXIC, BUT THE INDUCED EFFECTS ON CELLS SHOULD NOT BE NEGLECTED IN ANY FUTURE DETAILED STUDIES AND WHEN CONSIDERING THIS SCAFFOLD FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT.

IN THIS CONTEXT, THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF CLT AT BIOCHEMICAL, TISSULAR, AND INDIVIDUAL LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION USING THE INVASIVE BIVALVE CORBICULA LARGILLIERTI AS A BIOINDICATOR SPECIES. CLAMS WERE EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT SUBLETHAL CONCENTRATIONS (0, 10, 20 AND 50¬†¬µG. L  CLT) FOR 96¬†H. AT BIOCHEMICAL LEVEL, THE ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY (GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE, CATALASE, ACETYL-, BUTIRYL- AND CARBOXYL-ESTERASES) AND LIPID PEROXIDATION WERE MEASURED IN GILLS AND THE VISCERAL MASS. ALSO, THE DIGESTIVE GLAND MORPHOMETRY THROUGH QUANTITATIVE HISTOLOGICAL INDEXES WAS REGISTERED AT THE TISSULAR LEVEL. FINALLY, FILTERING ACTIVITY AND BURIAL BEHAVIOR AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WERE MEASURED. AT THE HIGHEST CLT CONCENTRATION, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY (EXCEPT FOR BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE), LIPID PEROXIDATION AND IN DIGESTIVE GLAND MORPHOMETRY. IT WAS ALSO REGISTERED INCREASES OF THE FILTERING ACTIVITY AND THE LATENCY TIME TO BURIAL. MOST OF THE BIOMARKERS ASSESSED SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RESPONSES UNDER CLT EXPOSURE. THEREFORE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT C. LARGILLIERTI WAS AFFECTED BY CLT, IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT OTHER SPECIES COULD BE IN A POTENTIAL RISK IF THIS FUNGICIDE IS PRESENT IN FRESHWATER SYSTEMS.

THE ABILITY OF   L. TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC)-RICH EXTRACTS TO STIMULATE BRAIN GLUCOSE UPTAKE AND UTILIZATION AS WELL AS ITS MODULATORY EFFECT ON GLUCONEOGENESIS, ANTIOXIDATIVE, PURINERGIC AND CHOLINERGIC ACTIVITIES WERE INVESTIGATED IN ISOLATED RATS' BRAINS.   LEAVES WERE SEQUENTIALLY EXTRACTED TO YIELD THE HEXANE AND DICHLOROMETHANE EXTRACTS. THE EXTRACTS WERE INCUBATED AT 37¬∞C WITH FRESHLY HARVESTED BRAINS IN THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE FOR 2¬†H. THE CONTROL CONSISTED OF INCUBATION WITHOUT THE EXTRACTS, WHILE BRAINS WITHOUT THE EXTRACTS AND GLUCOSE SERVED AS THE NORMAL CONTROL. METFORMIN WAS USED AS THE STANDARD DRUG.   EXTRACTS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT (  < 0.05) INCREASE IN BRAIN GLUCOSE UPTAKE, WITH CONCOMITANT ELEVATION OF GLUTATHIONE LEVEL, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, CATALASE, AND ECTO-NUCLEOSIDE TRIPHOSPHATE DIPHOSPHOHYDROLASE ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS. INCUBATION WITH   EXTRACTS ALSO LED TO DEPLETION IN MALONDIALDEHYDE AND NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, GLUCOSE 6-PHOSPHATASE AND FRUCTOSE-1,6-BIPHOSPHATASE ACTIVITIES.

DRUGS TARGETING ONLY ONE PATHOLOGICAL CONDITION HAVE GENERATED ONLY LIMITED EFFICACY. THUS, COMBINING TWO OR MORE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS INTO ONE MOLECULE IS BELIEVED TO PROVIDE HIGHER BENEFIT FOR THE TREATMENT OF AD. IN THE PRESENTED STUDY, WE DESIGNED, SYNTHESIZED, AND BIOLOGICALLY EVALUATED 15 NOVEL FLUOREN-9-AMINE DERIVATIVES. THE IN SILICO PREDICTION SUGGESTED BOTH THE ORAL AVAILABILITY AND PERMEATION THROUGH THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB). AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOLOGICAL PROFILE INCLUDED DETERMINATION OF THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION AND NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM AT THE GLUN1/GLUN2A AND GLUN1/GLUN2B SUBUNITS, ALONG WITH A LOW CYTOTOXICITY PROFILE IN THE CHO-K1 CELL LINE. INTERESTINGLY, COMPOUNDS REVEALED A SELECTIVE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INHIBITION PATTERN WITH ANTAGONISTIC ACTIVITY ON THE NMDARS. THEIR INTERACTION WITH BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE WAS ELUCIDATED BY STUDYING ENZYME KINETICS FOR COMPOUND   IN TANDEM WITH THE IN SILICO DOCKING SIMULATION. THE DOCKING STUDY SHOWED THE INTERACTION OF THE TRICYCLIC CORE OF NEW DERIVATIVES WITH TRP82 WITHIN THE ANIONIC SITE OF THE ENZYME IN A SIMILAR WAY AS THE TEMPLATE DRUG TACRINE.

DOCKING ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT BISDEMETHOXYCURCUMIN, THE MAJOR CONSTITUENT OF REVERC3, HAS DIFFERENT PREFERENCES OF BINDING IN THE ACTIVE SITES OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE. HOWEVER, THE BEST BINDING POSE PREDICTIONS ARE IN LINE WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL BINDING MODE OF THE CHOLINESTERASES.  : THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT BISDEMETHOXYCURCUMIN-ENRICHED TURMERIC EXTRACT COULD IMPROVE THE CHOLINERGIC FUNCTIONS VIA DUAL INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASES. HOWEVER, THE PREDOMINANT ROLE OF BISDEMETHOXYCURCUMIN IN REVERC3 MUST BE FURTHER VALIDATED USING PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS.

THE METHANOL EXTRACT (ME) OF LV AND THE CHLOROFORM, ETHYL ACETATE (ETOAC), AND AQUEOUS FRACTIONS OBTAINED FROM IT WERE USED FOR BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND ISOLATION STUDIES. THE ME AND ALL FRACTIONS WERE TESTED FOR THEIR ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND TYR INHIBITORY AND ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIALS USING ELISA MICROTITER ASSAYS. SEVEN MAJOR COMPOUNDS WERE ISOLATED FROM THE ACTIVE ETOAC FRACTION BY SEMI-PREPARATIVE HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY. THE STRUCTURES OF THE COMPOUNDS WERE ELUCIDATED BY SEVERAL SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS. MARKED ACHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE ETOAC FRACTION (6337¬±1.74%), BCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY IN THE ME AND ETOAC FRACTION (85.84¬±3.01% AND 83.82¬±3.93%), TOTAL PHENOL CONTENT IN THE ETOAC FRACTION (261.59¬±3.95 MG EQUIVALENT OF GALLIC ACID/1 G OF EXTRACT) AND TOTAL FLAVONOID CONTENTS IN THE ETOAC FRACTION (515.54¬±2.80 MG EQUIVALENT OF QUERCETIN/1 G OF EXTRACT), AND 2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL RADICAL SCAVENGING ACTIVITY AND FERRIC-REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER VALUES IN THE AQUEOUS AND ETOAC FRACTIONS (92.54¬±0.67%, 92.11¬±0.30%; 2.318¬±0.054, 2.224¬±0.091, RESPECTIVELY). ACCORDINGLY, THE ISOLATION STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT ON THE ETOAC FRACTIONS.

ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), AN ENZYME HYDROLYZING ACH, IS EXPRESSED IN IMMUNE CELLS SUGGESTING NON-CLASSICAL FUNCTION IN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES. HERE, THE EXPRESSION OF PRIMA-LINKED G4 ACHE WAS IDENTIFIED ON THE SURFACE OF MACROPHAGES. IN LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-INDUCED INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES, ACHE WAS UPREGULATED BY THE BINDING OF NF- B ONTO THE   PROMOTOR. CONVERSELY, THE OVEREXPRESSION OF G4 ACHE INHIBITED ACH-SUPPRESSED CYTOKINE RELEASE AND CELL MIGRATION, WHICH WAS IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF APPLIED ACHE INHIBITORS. ACHEMT, A DNA CONSTRUCT WITHOUT ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY, WAS ADOPTED TO IDENTIFY THE PROTEIN ROLE OF ACHE IN IMMUNE SYSTEM. OVEREXPRESSION OF G4 ACHEMT INDUCED CELL MIGRATION AND INHIBITED ACH-SUPPRESSED CELL MIGRATION. THE CO-LOCALIZATION OF  7 NACHR AND ACHE WAS FOUND IN MACROPHAGES, SUGGESTING THE POTENTIAL INTERACTION OF  7 NACHR AND ACHE. BESIDES, IMMUNOPRECIPITATION SHOWED A CLOSE ASSOCIATION OF  7 NACHR AND ACHE PROTEIN IN CELL MEMBRANE. HENCE, THE NOVEL FUNCTION OF ACHE IN MACROPHAGE BY INTERACTING WITH  7 NACHR WAS DETERMINED. TOGETHER WITH HYDROLYSIS OF ACH, ACHE PLAYS A DIRECT ROLE IN THE REGULATION OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. AS SUCH, ACHE COULD SERVE AS A NOVEL TARGET TO TREAT AGE-RELATED DISEASES BY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES.

TESTING FOR BCHE DEFICIENCY IS USUALLY PERFORMED BY BIOCHEMICAL METHODS AND IS GENERALLY ONLY OFFERED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE A PERSONAL OR FAMILY HISTORY OF PROLONGED POST-SUCCINYLCHOLINE NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE. USING A CLINICAL TEST, WE INVESTIGATED THE FREQUENCIES OF   GENOTYPES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK FOR PROLONGED POST-SUCCINYLCHOLINE NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE. FIVE   VARIANTS, INCLUDING THE A (ATYPICAL, RS1799807), K (KALOW, RS1803274), F  (FLUORIDE-1, RS28933389), F  (FLUORIDE-2, RS28933390), AND S  (SILENT-1, RS398124632), WERE GENOTYPED IN A LARGE (N = 13,301), MULTI-ETHNIC COHORT IN THE UNITED STATES. SUBJECTS WERE RECIPIENTS OF PHARMACOGENETIC TESTING ORDERED BY THEIR PHYSICIANS AS PART OF ROUTINE CARE. THE MINOR ALLELE FREQUENCIES OF A, K, F , F , AND S  WERE 1.60%, 19.93%, 0.08%, 0.47%, AND 0.04%, RESPECTIVELY, IN THIS COHORT. BASED ON A REVIEW OF BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL DATA OF THESE VARIANTS, WE GROUPED   GENOTYPES INTO FOUR PHENOTYPIC CATEGORIES TO STRATIFY THE RISK FOR PROLONGED POST-SUCCINYLCHOLINE NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE. APPROXIMATELY 0.06% OF PATIENTS WERE PREDICTED TO HAVE SEVERE BCHE DEFICIENCY, 8% WERE PREDICTED TO HAVE MODERATE BCHE DEFICIENCY, AND 29% WERE PREDICTED TO HAVE MILD BCHE DEFICIENCY. COMPARED TO OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS, CAUCASIANS WERE PREDICTED TO HAVE THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF BCHE DEFICIENCY. WHILE SEVERE BCHE DEFICIENCY IS RARE IN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 8% OF AMERICANS ARE AT MODERATE RISK OF PROLONGED POST-SUCCINYLCHOLINE NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE, SUGGESTING THAT A SIZABLE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM PREOPERATIVE GENETIC TESTING OF  .

MORE RECENTLY, A NOVEL SERIES OF 4- -PHENYLAMINOQUINOLINES WAS SYNTHESIZED AND EVALUATED AGAINST ACHE AND BUCHE IN WHICH ONE OF THE COMPOUNDS DISPLAYED APPRECIABLE INHIBITION COMPARED TO THE STANDARD COMPOUND, GALANTAMINE. TO PROVIDE A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE INHIBITION MECHANISM OF THIS POTENT COMPOUND AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, COMPUTATIONAL BIOMOLECULAR MODELING WAS CARRIED OUT. THE INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED WITH THE EXPLORATION OF THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE IDENTIFIED COMPOUND   AND REFERENCE DRUG, GALANTAMINE. DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) CALCULATIONS REVEAL SOME CONCEPTUAL PARAMETERS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE STABILITY AND REACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS AS POTENTIAL INHIBITORS. TO UNVEIL THE BINDING MECHANISM, ENERGETICS AND ENZYME-LIGAND INTERACTIONS, MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS OF SIX DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WERE EXECUTED OVER A PERIOD. CALCULATED BINDING FREE ENERGY VALUES ARE IN THE SAME ORDER WITH EXPERIMENTAL IC  DATA. IDENTIFICATION OF THE MAIN RESIDUES DRIVING OPTIMUM BINDING OF THE ACTIVE COMPOUND   TO THE BINDING REGION OF BOTH ACHE AND BUCHE SHOWED TRP81 AND TRP110 AS THE MOST IMPORTANT, RESPECTIVELY. IT WAS PROPOSED THAT THE STUDIED COMPOUND COULD SERVE AS A DUAL INHIBITOR FOR ACHE AND BUCHE, THEREFORE, WOULD POTENTIALLY BE A PROMISING MOIETY IN A MULTI-TARGET APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISORDER.COMMUNICATED BY RAMASWAMY H.

AMARYLLIDACEAE ALKALOIDS ARE OF MAIN INTEREST BECAUSE OF THEIR CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION POTENTIAL, WHICH IS THE MAIN PALLIATIVE TREATMENT AVAILABLE FOR THIS DISEASE. WE EVALUATED THE ALKALOIDAL PROFILE AND THE   INHIBITORY ACTIVITY ON ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) OF BULB ALKALOID EXTRACT OF   AND   COLLECTED IN ECUADOR.

A MEDIA EXCHANGE WAS PERFORMED AT DAY 7 OF CULTIVATION BY REMOVING SPENT SUGAR-RICH MEDIUM (NB+S) AND ADDING FRESH SUGAR-FREE (NB-S) MEDIUM TO INDUCE THE RICE Œ±-AMYLASE 3D (RAMY3D) PROMOTER TO PRODUCE RICE RECOMBINANT HUMAN BCHE (RRBCHE). USING A 1.25X-CONCENTRATED SUGAR-FREE MEDIUM TOGETHER WITH AN 80% REDUCED WORKING VOLUME DURING THE MEDIA EXCHANGE LED TO A TOTAL ACTIVE RRBCHE PRODUCTION LEVEL OF 79 ¬± 2 ¬µG (G FW)  OR 7.5 ¬± 0.4 MG L  IN THE PRESENCE OF KIFUNENSINE, WHICH WAS 1.5-TIMES HIGHER THAN OUR PREVIOUS BIOREACTOR RUNS USING NORMAL SUGAR-FREE (NB-S) MEDIA WITH NO KIFUNENSINE TREATMENT. IMPORTANTLY, THE AMOUNT OF SECRETED ACTIVE RRBCHE IN CULTURE MEDIUM WAS ENHANCED IN THE PRESENCE OF KIFUNENSINE, COMPRISING 44% OF THE TOTAL ACTIVE RRBCHE AT DAY 5 FOLLOWING INDUCTION. COOMASSIE-STAINED SDS-PAGE GEL AND WESTERN BLOT ANALYSES REVEALED DIFFERENT ELECTROPHORETIC MIGRATION OF PURIFIED RRBCHE BANDS WITH AND WITHOUT KIFUNENSINE TREATMENT, WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENT  -GLYCOFORMS.  -GLYCOSYLATION ANALYSIS SHOWED SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED OLIGOMANNOSE GLYCANS (MAN5/6/7/8) IN RRBCHE TREATED WITH KIFUNENSINE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. HOWEVER, THE MASS-TRANSFER LIMITATION OF KIFUNENSINE WAS LIKELY THE MAJOR REASON FOR INCOMPLETE INHIBITION OF Œ±-MANNOSIDASE I IN THIS BIOREACTOR STUDY.

HOWEVER, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ACHE INHIBITION ALONE CANNOT EXPLAIN ALL THE TOXICOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS IN PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO OPS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE STATUS OF ANTIOXIDANTS MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA), SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD), GLUTATHIONE (GSH) (REDUCED), CATALASE, AND FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER (FRAP) IN CHRONIC OP-EXPOSED GROUPS FROM CAMEROON AND PAKISTAN. MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) OF GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASES ( ), CATALASE GENE ( , RS7943316), SIRTUIN 1 GENE ( , RS10823108), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE GENE ( , RS2571598), AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE GENE ( , RS3495) WERE SCREENED IN THE OP-EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS TO FIND THE POSSIBLE CAUSATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH OXIDATIVE STRESS AND TOXICITY. CHOLINESTERASE AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES WERE MEASURED BY COLORIMETRIC METHODS USING A SPECTROPHOTOMETER. SALTING-OUT METHOD WAS EMPLOYED FOR DNA EXTRACTION FROM BLOOD FOLLOWED BY RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH POLYMORPHISM (RFLP) FOR MOLECULAR ANALYSIS. CHOLINERGIC ENZYMES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN OP-EXPOSED GROUPS. CATALASE AND SOD WERE DECREASED AND MDA AND FRAP WERE INCREASED IN OP-EXPOSED GROUPS COMPARED TO UNEXPOSED GROUPS IN BOTH GROUPS. GSH WAS DECREASED ONLY IN PAKISTANI OPS-EXPOSED GROUP. MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF ACHE, BCHE, CATALASE, GSTP1, AND GSTM1 SNPS REVEALED A TENTATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH THEIR PHENOTYPIC EXPRESSION THAT IS LEVEL OF ANTIOXIDANT AND CHOLINERGIC ENZYMES. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT CHRONIC OPS EXPOSURE INDUCES OXIDATIVE STRESS WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED SNP POLYMORPHISM. THE TOXICOGENETICS OF UNDERSTUDIED SNPS WERE EXAMINED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO OUR UNDERSTANDING. THE FINDINGS MAY LEAD TO A NEWER AREA OF INVESTIGATION ON OPS INDUCED HEALTH ISSUES AND TOXICOGENETICS.

IN THE SCHISANDRACEAE FAMILY ARE WOODY VINE PLANTS, WHICH PRODUCE EDIBLE RED FRUITS THAT ARE RICH IN NUTRIENTS AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES. DESPITE THEIR VALUABLE FOOD APPLICATIONS,   SPP. ARE ONLY ABLE TO GROW NATURALLY IN THE FOREST, AND REPRODUCTION HANDLED BY BOTANISTS IS STILL IN PROGRESS WITH A VERY LOW GROWTH RATE. SUBSEQUENTLY,   SPP. WERE LISTED AS ENDANGERED SPECIES BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES (IUCN) IN 2011. TWO DIFFERENT   SPP., INCLUDING   (LEM.) A.C. SM. AND   (ROXB.) CRAIB, ARE MOSTLY FOUND IN NORTHERN THAILAND. THESE RARE, WILD FRUITS ARE UNRECOGNIZABLE TO OUTSIDERS, AND THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN LIMITED INVESTIGATIONS INTO ITS BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, AIMED TO COMPARATIVELY INVESTIGATE THE PHENOLIC PROFILES, ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES, AND INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE KEY ENZYMES INVOLVED IN DIABETES (Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE AND Œ±-AMYLASE) AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND BETA-SECRETASE 1 (BACE-1)) IN DIFFERENT FRUIT PARTS (EXOCARP, MESOCARP (EDIBLE PART), SEED, AND CORE) OF   (LEM.) A.C. SM. AND   (ROXB.) CRAIB. THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT KADSURA SPP. EXTRACTS WERE RICH IN FLAVONOL (QUERCETIN), FLAVANONE (NARINGENIN), ANTHOCYANIDINS (CYANIDIN AND DELPHINIDIN), AND ANTHOCYANINS (CYANIDIN 3- -GLUCOSIDE (KUROMANIN), CYANIDIN 3- -GALACTOSIDE (IDEAIN), CYANIDIN 3- -RUTINOSIDE (KERACYANIN), AND CYANIDIN 3,5-DI- -GLUCOSIDE (CYANIN)). THESE FLAVONOIDS WERE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGH ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES AND KEY ENZYME INHIBITIONS DETECTED IN   SPP. EXTRACTS. THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY CAN SUPPORT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF   SPP. AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF PHENOLICS AND ANTI-OXIDATIVE AGENTS WITH HEALTH BENEFITS AGAINST DIABETES AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. BESIDES, EXOCARP AND THE CORE OF KADSURA SPP. EXHIBITED HIGHER PHENOLIC CONTENTS, ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES, AND KEY ENZYME INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE MESOCARP AND SEEDS, RESPECTIVELY. THIS INFORMATION CAN PROMOTE THE USE OF FRUIT PARTS OTHER THAN THE EDIBLE MESOCARP FOR FUTURE FOOD APPLICATIONS USING   SPP. RATHER THAN THESE BEING WASTED.

IN OUR PRESENT RESEARCH, A NUMBER OF XANTHONE DERIVATIVES WERE FIRST DESIGNED USING A PHARMACOPHORE MODEL FOR HISTAMINE H  RECEPTOR (H R) ANTAGONISTS/INVERSE AGONISTS, AND VIRTUAL DOCKING WAS THEN PERFORMED FOR THE ENZYME ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE. NEXT, 23 COMPOUNDS WERE SYNTHESISED AND EVALUATED IN¬†VITRO FOR HUMAN H R (HH R) AFFINITY AND INHIBITORY ACTIVITY ON CHOLINESTERASES. MOST OF THE TARGET COMPOUNDS SHOWED HH R AFFINITIES IN NANOMOLAR RANGE AND EXHIBITED CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY WITH IC  VALUES IN SUBMICROMOLAR RANGE. FURTHERMORE, THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF MONOAMINE OXIDASES (MAO) A AND B WERE INVESTIGATED. THE RESULTS SHOWED LOW MICROMOLAR AND SELECTIVE HUMAN MAO B (HMAO B) INHIBITION. TWO AZEPANE DERIVATIVES, NAMELY 23 (2-(5-(AZEPAN-1-YL)PENTYLOXY)-9H-XANTHEN-9-ONE) AND 25 (2-(5-(AZEPAN-1-YL)PENTYLOXY)-7-CHLORO-9H-XANTHEN-9-ONE), WERE ESPECIALLY VERY PROMISING AND SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY FOR HH R (K ¬†=¬†170¬†NM AND 100¬†NM RESPECTIVELY) AND HIGH INHIBITORY ACTIVITY FOR ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (IC ¬†=¬†180¬†NM AND 136¬†NM RESPECTIVELY).

ALL COMPOUNDS WERE POTENT INHIBITORS OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WITH SELECTIVITY TOWARD BCHE. THE LEAD COMPOUND 4-METHYL-N-(5-(1,2,3,4-TETRAHYDRO-ACRIDIN-9-YLAMINO)-PENTYL)-BENZENESULFONAMIDE ( ) EXHIBITED AN IC  (ACHE) = 0.131 ¬± 0.01 ¬µM (FIVE TIMES MORE POTENT THAN TACRINE), IC (BCHE) = 0.0680 ¬± 0.0014 ¬µM, AND 17.5 ¬± 1.5% PROPIDIUM DISPLACEMENT AT 20 ¬µM. THE COMPOUNDS POSSESSED LOW ACTIVITY AGAINST CARBOXYLESTERASE, INDICATING A LIKELY ABSENCE OF UNWANTED DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS IN CLINICAL USE. KINETICS STUDIES WERE CONSISTENT WITH MIXED-TYPE REVERSIBLE INHIBITION OF BOTH CHOLINESTERASES. MOLECULAR DOCKING DEMONSTRATED DUAL BINDING SITES OF THE CONJUGATES IN ACHE AND CLARIFIED THE DIFFERENCES IN THE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS FOR ACHE AND BCHE INHIBITION. THE CONJUGATES COULD BIND TO THE ACHE PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE AND DISPLACE PROPIDIUM, INDICATING THEIR POTENTIAL TO BLOCK ACHE-INDUCED Œ≤-AMYLOID AGGREGATION, THEREBY EXERTING A DISEASE-MODIFYING EFFECT. ALL COMPOUNDS DEMONSTRATED LOW ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY. COMPUTATIONAL ADMET PROFILES PREDICTED THAT ALL COMPOUNDS WOULD HAVE GOOD INTESTINAL ABSORPTION, MEDIUM BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITY, AND MEDIUM CARDIAC TOXICITY RISK. OVERALL, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE NOVEL CONJUGATES SHOW PROMISE FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION AS MULTITARGET ANTI-AD AGENTS.

SIX OF THE OTHER SEVEN COMPOUNDS ONLY WEAKLY INHIBITED ACHE AND BCHE, WHEREAS LIQUIRITIN APIOSIDE MODERATELY INHIBITED ACHE (IC  = 36.68 ¬µM). LIQUIRITIGENIN (LG) POTENTLY INHIBITED MAO-B (IC  = 0.098 ¬µM) AND MAO-A (IC  = 0.27 ¬µM), AND LIQUIRITIN, A GLYCOSIDE OF LG, WEAKLY INHIBITED MAO-B (>40 ¬µM). GC WAS A REVERSIBLE, NONCOMPETITIVE INHIBITOR OF BCHE WITH A K  VALUE OF 4.47 ¬µM, AND LG WAS A REVERSIBLE COMPETITIVE INHIBITOR OF MAO-B WITH A K  VALUE OF 0.024 ¬µM. DOCKING SIMULATIONS SHOWED THAT THE BINDING AFFINITY OF GC FOR BCHE (-7.8 KCAL/MOL) WAS GREATER THAN ITS AFFINITY FOR ACHE (-7.1 KCAL/MOL), AND SUGGESTED THAT GC INTERACTED WITH BCHE AT THR284 AND VAL288 BY HYDROGEN BONDS (DISTANCES: 2.42 AND 1.92 √Ö, RESPECTIVELY) BEYOND THE LIGAND BINDING SITE OF BCHE, BUT THAT GC DID NOT FORM HYDROGEN BOND WITH ACHE. THE BINDING AFFINITY OF LG FOR MAO-B (-8.8 KCAL/MOL) WAS GREATER THAN ITS AFFINITY FOR MAO-A (-7.9 KCAL/MOL). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST GC AND LG SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PROMISING COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WITH MULTI-TARGETING ACTIVITIES.

THEREAFTER, THE ANIMALS WERE SUBJECTED TO BEHAVIORAL STUDIES (MORRIS WATER MAZE AND Y-MAZE TESTS). FINALLY, THE RATS WERE SACRIFICED AND THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF THE RAT'S BRAIN WAS ISOLATED FOR BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSES. THE RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MEMORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION AS REVEALED BY MORRIS WATER MAZE AND Y-MAZE TESTS IN SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED RATS WHICH WERE REVERSED BY SHADDOCK PEELS EXTRACT. ALSO, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE ACTIVITY OF ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHOHYDROLASE (AMPASE) WITH A SIMULTANEOUS INCREASE IN ACTIVITIES OF ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA), ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE DIPHOSPHOHYDROLASE (ATPDASE), ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) IN SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED RATS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL. BESIDES, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) AND REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) LEVELS WERE OBSERVED IN SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED RATS. HOWEVER, DONEPEZIL OR SHADDOCK PEELS EXTRACT (50 AND 100¬ÄâMG/KG) CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT INHIBITORY EFFECT ON ACHE, AND ADA ACTIVITIES WHEN COMPARED TO SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED RATS. RATS TREATED WITH SHADDOCK PEELS EXTRACT ALSO SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MDA AND ROS LEVELS COMPARED TO SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED RATS. THEREFORE, OUR FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE COGNITIVE-ENHANCING EFFECTS OF SHADDOCK PEELS EXTRACT COULD BE DUE TO ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES AND MODULATION OF SOME ENZYMES LINKED WITH COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION.

REGEL (BROMELIACEAE) IS A CHILEAN ENDEMIC PLANT POPULARLY KNOWN AS "QUISCAL" AND PRODUCES AN EDIBLE FRUIT CONSUMED BY THE LOCAL MAPUCHE COMMUNITIES NAMED AS "CHUP√≥N". IN THIS STUDY, SEVERAL METABOLITES INCLUDING PHENOLIC ACIDS, ORGANIC ACIDS, SUGAR DERIVATIVES, CATECHINS, PROANTHOCYANIDINS, FATTY ACIDS, IRIDOIDS, COUMARINS, BENZOPHENONE, FLAVONOIDS, AND TERPENES WERE IDENTIFIED IN   FRUITS USING ULTRAHIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-PHOTODIODE ARRAY DETECTION COUPLED WITH A ORBITRAP MASS SPECTROMETRY (UHPLC-PDA-ORBITRAP-MS) ANALYSIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE FRUITS SHOWED MODERATE ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITIES (I.E., 487.11 ¬± 26.22 ŒºMOL TE/G DRY WEIGHT) IN THE STABLE RADICAL DPPH ASSAY, 169.08 ¬± 9.81 TE/G DRY WEIGHT IN THE FERRIC REDUCING POWER ASSAY, 190.32 ¬± 6.23 TE/G DRY WEIGHT IN THE ABTS ASSAY, AND 76.46 ¬± 3.18% INHIBITION IN THE SUPEROXIDE ANION SCAVENGING ASSAY. THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY POTENTIAL WAS EVALUATED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE). FROM THE FINDINGS, PROMISING RESULTS WERE OBSERVED FOR PULP AND SEEDS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT   FRUITS ARE A RICH SOURCE OF DIVERSE SECONDARY METABOLITES WITH ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITIES. IN ADDITION, THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE SUGGEST THAT NATURAL PRODUCTS OR FOOD SUPPLEMENTS DERIVED FROM   FRUITS ARE OF INTEREST FOR THEIR NEUROPROTECTIVE POTENTIAL.

PLANT PARTS CONTAIN NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENTS THAT INTERACT WITH SPECIFIC TARGETS TO INHIBIT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD). ORGANIC SOLVENTS INCLUDING METHANOL, ETHYL ACETATE, HEXANE, AND  -BUTANOL, ARE WIDELY EMPLOYED FOR EXTRACTION OF SACRED LOTUS BUT IMPACT FOOD SAFETY. SEED EMBRYO, FLOWER STALK, STAMEN, OLD LEAF, PETAL, AND LEAF STALK OF SACRED LOTUS WERE EXTRACTED USING HOT WATER (AQUEOUS EXTRACTION). THE EXTRACTIONS WERE ANALYZED FOR THEIR BIOACTIVE CONSTITUENTS, ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTI-AD PROPERTIES AS KEY ENZYME INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES TOWARD ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND Œ≤-SECRETASE 1 (BACE-1). RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SACRED LOTUS STAMEN EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PHENOLICS, INCLUDING PHENOLIC ACIDS AND FLAVONOIDS, THAT CONTRIBUTED TO HIGH ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY VIA BOTH SINGLE ELECTRON TRANSFER (SET) AND HYDROGEN ATOM TRANSFER (HAT) MECHANISMS, WITH ANTI-ACHE, ANTI-BCHE, AND ANTI-BACE-1 ACTIVITIES. TO ENHANCE UTILIZATION OF OTHER SACRED LOTUS PARTS, A COMBINATION OF STAMEN, OLD LEAF AND PETAL AS THE THREE SACRED LOTUS PLANT COMPONENTS WITH THE HIGHEST PHENOLIC CONTENTS, ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES, AND ENZYME INHIBITORY PROPERTIES WAS ANALYZED. ANTAGONIST INTERACTION WAS OBSERVED, POSSIBLY FROM FLAVONOIDS-FLAVONOIDS INTERACTION. FURTHER IN-DEPTH ELUCIDATION OF THIS ISSUE IS REQUIRED. FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT AN AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF THE STAMEN HAS POTENTIAL FOR APPLICATION AS A FUNCTIONAL FOOD TO MITIGATE THE ONSET OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

GUZM√°N EX T.J. BARONI IS AN EXCELLENT EDIBLE MUSHROOM WHOSE COMPOUNDS AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ARE STILL UNKNOWN. IN THIS STUDY, N-HEXANE, ETHYL ACETATE AND METHANOL EXTRACTS FROM FRUITING BODIES AND LIQUID-CULTURED MYCELIA WERE COMPARED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, THE EVALUATION OF SCAVENGER (DPPH, ABTS) AND REDUCING (CUPRAC, FRAP) ACTIVITIES, AND THE ENZYME INHIBITION OF Œ±-AMYLASE, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND TYROSINASE. ADDITIONALLY,   EXTRACTS WERE EVALUATED FOR ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTIMYCOTIC ACTIVITIES AGAINST GRAM+ AND GRAM- BACTERIA, AND CLINICAL YEAST AND FUNGAL DERMATOPHYTES. FINALLY, BASED ON THE EXTRACT CONTENT IN PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, IN SILICO STUDIES, INCLUDING THE DOCKING APPROACH, WERE CONDUCTED TO PREDICT THE PUTATIVE TARGETS (NAMELY TYROSINASE, LANOSTEROL-14-Œ±-DEMETHYLASE, THE MULTIDRUG EFFLUX SYSTEM TRANSPORTERS OF   (MDTK) AND   (PMPM), AND   Œ≤-LACTAMASE (ORF259)) UNDERLYING THE OBSERVED BIO-PHARMACOLOGICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL EFFECTS. THE METHANOLIC EXTRACT FROM MYCELIA WAS THE RICHEST IN GALLIC ACID, WHEREAS THE ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACT FROM FRUITING BODIES WAS THE SOLE EXTRACT TO SHOW LEVELS OF CATECHIN. SPECIFICALLY, DOCKING RUNS DEMONSTRATED AN AFFINITY OF CATECHIN TOWARDS ALL DOCKED PROTEINS, IN THE MICROMOLAR RANGE. THESE IN SILICO DATA ARE CONSISTENT, AT LEAST IN PART, WITH THE HIGHEST ACTIVITY OF ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACT AS AN ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTI-TYROSINASE (554.30 MG KAE/G FOR FRUITING BODIES AND 412.81 MG KAE/G FOR MYCELIA) AGENT. THE ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACTS WERE ALSO NOTED AS BEING THE MOST ACTIVE (2.97 MMOL ACAE/G FOR FRUITING BODIES AND 2.25 MMOL ACAE/G FOR MYCELIA) ON Œ±-AMYLASE. BCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES VARIED FROM 2.61 TO 26.78 MG GALAE/G, WHILE THE TESTED EXTRACTS WERE NOT ACTIVE ON ACHE. IN CONCLUSION, ALL MUSHROOM EXTRACTS TESTED IN THIS STUDY HAD POTENT ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES. PARTICULARLY, AMONG THE TESTED EXTRACTS, THE ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACT SHOWED THE HIGHEST EFFICACY AS BOTH AN ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTI-TYROSINASE AGENT. THIS COULD BE RELATED, ALBEIT PARTIALLY, TO ITS CONTENT OF CATECHIN. IN THIS REGARD, THE BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES SHOWED INTERACTIONS OF CATECHIN WITH TYROSINASE AND SPECIFIC MICROBIAL PROTEINS INVOLVED IN THE RESISTANCE TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS, THUS SUGGESTING INNOVATIVE PHARMACOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF   EXTRACTS.

SEEDS, USING CO  AS SOLVENT, IS PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY. EXTRACTION EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT IN TWO STEPS: AT PRESSURES OF (90 OR 300) BAR AND TEMPERATURE OF 40¬Äâ¬∞C. THE FIRST EXTRACTION STEP, PERFORMED AT 90 BAR, PRODUCED A VOLATILE FRACTION MAINLY FORMED BY APIOLE (82.1%) AND MYRISTICIN (11.4%). THE VOLATILE OIL YIELD WAS 2.6% BY WEIGHT OF THE CHARGE. THE SECOND EXTRACTION STEP, CARRIED OUT AT 300¬ÄâBAR PRODUCED A FIXED OIL AT A YIELD OF 0.4% BY WEIGHT. THE MOST REPRESENTED FATTY ACIDS IN   FIXED OIL WERE 18:1 N-12 (49.9%), 18:2 N-6 (18.2%), 18:1 N-9 (11.8%), AND 16:0 (7.4%). IN PARTICULAR, THE UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS 18:1 N-12 AND 18:1 N-9 AVERAGED 182.2¬ÄâMG/G AND 92.1¬ÄâMG/G OF OIL EXTRACT, RESPECTIVELY. THE QUALITY OF THE OILS EXTRACTED BY SFE, IN TERMS OF ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, WAS COMPARED TO THE OILS OBTAINED BY HYDRODISTILLATION (HD) IN A CLEVENGER APPARATUS AND BY SOLVENT EXTRACTION (SE) USING  -HEXANE IN A SOXHLET APPARATUS. THE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES WERE DETERMINED BY MEANS OF THE ABTS ASSAY. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE FIXED OIL POSSESSED LOW ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY (EC  = 0.4¬ÄâMG/ML) AND THE VOLATILE OIL HAD NO ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY. THE TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT, EXPRESSED AS CONCENTRATION OF GALLIC ACID (GALLIC ACID EQUIVALENT, GAE), OF THE FIXED OIL WAS 1.5¬ÄâMG/G. THE FIXED OIL FOUND TO HAVE INHIBITORY EFFECTS AGAINST Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, THE VOLATILE OIL IS ACTIVE ON ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), TYROSINASE, AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE. BOTH SAMPLES HAVE WEAK INHIBITORY ACTIVITY ON Œ±-AMYLASE AND NO ACTIVITY ON BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE).

THE DESIGNED EDARAVONE- -BENZYL PYRIDINIUM HYBRID COMPOUNDS WERE DOCKED WITHIN THE ACHE ACTIVE SITE. THE RESULTS INDICATED INTERACTIONS WITH CONSERVED AMINO ACIDS (TRP279 IN PAS AND TRP84 IN CAS), SUGGESTING GOOD DUAL-SITE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY. SIGNIFICANT   ACHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES WERE OBSERVED FOR SELECTED COMPOUNDS (IC : 1.2-4.6¬Äâ¬µM) WITH LIMITED BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY (IC 'S >160¬Äâ¬µM), INDICATING EXCELLENT SELECTIVITY TOWARDS ACHE (SI: 46 - >278). THE COMPOUNDS ALSO SHOWED CONSIDERABLE ANTIOXIDANT ABILITY, SIMILAR TO EDARAVONE.   STUDIES INDICATED THAT THESE COMPOUNDS SHOULD CROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER, MAKING THEM PROMISING LEAD MOLECULES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S AGENTS.

GRAPE POLYPHENOLS, INDEED, HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND AGAINST OXIDATIVE STRESS, RESPONSIBLE FOR VARIOUS DISORDERS SUCH AS CANCER, DIABETES AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES, SOXHLET (SOX), ACCELERATED SOLVENT (ASE 40, ASE 50) AND ULTRASOUND ASSISTED EXTRACTION (UAE) WERE STUDIED IN THIS WORK TO EVALUATE THEIR IMPACT ON THE CHEMICAL PROFILE AND BIOACTIVE POTENTIAL OF   L. (CV. AGLIANICO) LEAF EXTRACTS. THE PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILE WAS INVESTIGATED BY HPLC-DAD AND 9 PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND QUANTIFIED IN THE EXTRACT. MOREOVER, THE ANTIOXIDANT, ANTICHOLINESTERASE AND ANTITYROSINASE ACTIVITIES WERE EVALUATED. IN DETAIL, THE TOTAL POLYPHENOL CONTENT AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY (2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL, OXYGEN RADICAL ABSORBANCE CAPACITIES AND  -CAROTENE BLEACHING ASSAYS) WERE EVALUATED AND COMPARED TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY INDEX (RACI). TO TEST THE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF EXTRACTS TOWARDS CHOLINESTERASES, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INHIBITION ASSAYS WERE PERFORMED. SOX AND ASE 50 HAVE SHOWN THE HIGHEST VALUE OF RACI, 0.76 AND 0.65, RESPECTIVELY. REGARDING ENZYMATIC INHIBITORY ACTIVITY, ASE 50 (IC  = 107.16 ¬± 8.12 ŒºG/ML) AND SOX (IC  = 171.34 ¬± 12.12 ŒºG/ML) EXTRACTS EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST ACHE AND BCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE UAE (IC  = 293.2 ¬± 25.6 ŒºG/ML, FOLLOWED BY SOX (IC  = 302.5 ¬± 38.3 ŒºG/ML) SHOWED THE HIGHEST TYROSINASE INHIBITION VALUE. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT AGLIANICO LEAVES ARE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF PHENOLS THAT COULD BE USED TO PREVENT OXIDATIVE STRESS AND BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL IN DISEASES TREATABLE WITH TYROSINASE AND CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS, LIKE MYASTHENIA GRAVIS OR ALZHEIMER'S.

THUS, IT IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP A SENSITIVE METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF OPS. HEREIN, A SIMPLE AND SENSITIVE SPLIT-TYPE ELECTROCHEMICAL METHOD WAS DEVELOPED BY USING MNO  NANOFLOWER-ELECTRON MEDIATOR AS A SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION ELEMENT. THE MNO  NANOFLOWER-ELECTRON MEDIATOR WAS SYNTHESIZED AND SHOWS AN EXCELLENT ELECTROCHEMICAL SIGNAL ATTRIBUTED TO THE HIGH SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA OF MNO  NANOFLOWER. MEANWHILE, THE INHIBITION OF OPS ON BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEM. IN THE ABSENCE OF TARGET MOLECULE, A LARGE NUMBER OF THIOCHOLINES (TCH) WERE YIELDED FROM HYDROLYSIS OF ACETYLTHIOCHOLINE (ATCH) BY BCHE. THE MNO  NANOFLOWER WAS CRACKED, AND SUBSEQUENTLY, MULTIPLE ELECTRON MEDIATOR MOLECULES WERE RELEASED FROM THE PLATFORM AFTER TREATED WITH TCH, THUS DECREASING THE ELECTROCHEMICAL RESPONSE. FURTHERMORE, THE INHIBITION OF OPS ON BCHE RESULTED IN THE REDUCED GENERATION OF TCH, THUS INDUCING THE RECOVERY OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SIGNAL. UNDER THE OPTIMAL EXPERIMENTAL, DICHLORVOS CAN BE DETECTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF 10 -10 ¬†M, WITH A DETECTION LIMIT OF 3¬Äâ√ó¬Äâ10 ¬†M. MOREOVER, THE ASSAY WAS SUCCESSFULLY USED TO ANALYZE DICHLORVOS IN CUCUMBER JUICE AND PEAR JUICE, SHOWING A GREAT PROMISING POTENTIAL FOR DETECTING ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES IN COMPLEX SAMPLES.

TCH IS PRODUCED FROM THE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE-ACETYLTHIOCHOLINE SYSTEM, ACCOMPANIED BY TARGET-TRIGGERED ROLLING CIRCLE AMPLIFICATION (RCA). THE CORE-SHELL MNO  NF@CDS WITH EXCELLENT PEC PERFORMANCE WAS SYNTHESIZED AND EMPLOYED AS A PHOTO-SENSING PLATFORM. THE TARGET WAS DETECTED ON A FUNCTIONALIZED MAGNETIC PROBE WITH THE CORRESPONDING APTAMER. UPON MALATHION INTRODUCTION, THE¬†APTAMER WAS DETACHED FROM THE MAGNETIC BEADS, WHILE CAPTURE DNA (CDNA, WITH PRIMER FRAGMENT) REMAINED ON THE BEADS. THE PRIMER FRAGMENT IN CDNA CAN TRIGGER THE¬†RCA REACTION TO FORM A LONG SINGLE-STRANDED DNA (SSDNA). FURTHERMORE, A LARGE NUMBER OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) WERE ASSEMBLED ON THE LONG SSDNA STRANDS THROUGH THE HYBRIDIZATION WITH THE S -AU-BCHE PROBE. THEREAFTER, TCH GENERATED FROM HYDROLYSIS OF ATCH BY BCHE CAN REDUCE MNO  NF (CORE) TO MN  AND RELEASE THE CDS NANOPARTICLES (SHELL) FROM THE PLATFORM ELECTRODE, SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCING THE PEC SIGNAL. UNDER OPTIMAL CONDITIONS, THE PROPOSED APTASENSOR EXHIBITED HIGH SENSITIVITY FOR MALATHION WITH A LOW DETECTION LIMIT OF 0.68¬†PG¬†ML . MEANWHILE, IT ALSO PRESENTS OUTSTANDING SPECIFICITY, REPRODUCIBILITY, AND STABILITY. IMPORTANTLY, THE SENSING PLATFORM PROVIDES A NEW¬†CONCEPT FOR DETECTION OF PESTICIDE.

THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE DISEASE-MODIFYING POTENTIAL OF SCOPOLETIN AGAINST MULTIPLE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AD SUCH AS CHOLINESTERASE ENZYMES, AŒ≤ PEPTIDES, AND NEUROPROTECTIVE PROPERTIES AGAINST AŒ≤- AND H O -INDUCED CYTOTOXICITY UNDER IN VITRO CONDITIONS. SCOPOLETIN WAS IDENTIFIED AND QUANTIFIED USING UPLC-QTOF (ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-QUADRUPOLE TIME-OF-FLIGHT) AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC), RESPECTIVELY. THE ANTIAMYLOIDOGENIC POTENTIAL WAS EVALUATED BY THIOFLAVIN T AND CONGO RED BINDING ASSAY. INHIBITION OF KEY ENZYMES, THAT IS, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, WAS INVESTIGATED BY ELLMAN'S ASSAY. UPLC-QTOF ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT MOST ABUNDANT PHYTOCONSTITUENT PRESENT IN   HYDROALCOHOLIC ROOT EXTRACT WAS SCOPOLETIN FOLLOWED BY FESTUCLAVINE AND ERGOMETRINE. SCOPOLETIN WAS FURTHER QUANTIFIED USING NOVEL REVERSE PHASE (RP)-HPLC METHOD DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY. THE NEUROPROTECTIVE POTENTIAL OF SCOPOLETIN WAS FOUND TO BE 69% AGAINST AŒ≤42-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY AND 73% AGAINST H O -INDUCED CYTOTOXICITY IN PC12 CELL CULTURE AT 40¬ÄâŒºM FINAL CONCENTRATION. AT THE SAME CONCENTRATION, SCOPOLETIN INHIBITED AŒ≤42 FIBRIL FORMATION UP TO 57%. THE IC  CONCENTRATION FOR ACHE AND BUCHE ENZYME INHIBITION BY SCOPOLETIN WAS 5.34 AND 9.11¬ÄâŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. THE ANTIAGGREGATION AND ENZYME INHIBITION RESULTS WERE COMPLEMENTED WITH STRONG MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS OF SCOPOLETIN WITH TARGET PROTEINS VALIDATED BY IN SILICO MOLECULAR DOCKING ANALYSIS. BASED ON THIS STUDY, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT SCOPOLETIN CAN BE USED AS A LEAD FOR AMELIORATION OF SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE-MODIFYING EFFECTS IN AD.

THE CURRENT STUDY WAS INSPIRED BY PREVIOUS DATA ON ANTICHOLINESTERASE PROPERTIES OF DITERPENOIDS FROM   AND OTHER LAMIACEAE SPECIES. THE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) INHIBITION BY THE THREE NEW NATURAL COMPOUNDS-(1 ,15 )-1-ACETOXYCRYPTOTANSHINONE (1), (1 )-1-ACETOXYTANSHINONE IIA (2), AND (15 )-1-OXOAEGYPTINONE A (3)-AS WELL AS, NEW FOR THIS GENUS, ISOGRANDIFOLIOL (4) WERE ASSESSED. THREE OF THESE COMPOUNDS EXHIBITED PROFOUND INHIBITION OF BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AND MUCH WEAKER INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE). ALL COMPOUNDS (1-4) SELECTIVELY INHIBITED BCHE (IC  = 2.4, 7.9, 50.8, AND 0.9 ¬µM, RESPECTIVELY), WHEREAS ONLY COMPOUNDS 3 AND 4 MODERATELY INHIBITED ACHE (IC  329.8 ¬µM AND 342.9 ¬µM). MOLECULAR DOCKING AND IN SILICO TOXICOLOGY PREDICTION STUDIES WERE ALSO PERFORMED ON THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS. NATURAL OXYGENATED NORDITERPENOIDS FROM THE TRADITIONAL CENTRAL ASIAN MEDICINAL PLANT   ARE SELECTIVE BCHE INHIBITORS. THEIR HIGH POTENTIAL MAKES THEM USEFUL CANDIDATE MOLECULES FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AS LEAD COMPOUNDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATURAL DRUG AGAINST DEMENTIA CAUSED BY NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES.

IN THIS WORK, A "TURN-ON" ASSAY IS PROPOSED BASED ON CONTROLLING THE INNER FILTER EFFECT (IFE) OF MNO  NANOSHEETS (NSS) ON SULFUR NANODOTS (S-DOTS). THE FLUORESCENCE OF S-DOTS IS EFFECTIVELY QUENCHED BY THE MNO  NSS, DUE TO THE WIDE OVERLAP OF THE EMISSION SPECTRUM OF S-DOTS AND ABSORPTION SPECTRUM OF MNO  NSS, TOGETHER WITH THE SUPERIOR LIGHT ABSORPTION CAPABILITY OF MNO  NSS. BCHE CAN CATALYZE ACETYLTHIOCHOLINE AND PRODUCE THIOCHOLINE, WHICH EFFECTIVELY DECOMPOSES THE MNO  NSS INTO MN , RESULTING IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE IFE AND RECOVERY OF FLUORESCENCE OF S-DOTS. TWO-STAGE LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE RATIO OF FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY AND CONCENTRATION OF BCHE ARE OBSERVED FROM 0.05 TO 10 AND FROM 10 TO 500 U L . A LIMIT OF DETECTION OF 0.035 U L  IS ACHIEVED, WHICH IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE SO FAR. THE AS-PROPOSED ASSAY IS ROBUST ENOUGH FOR PRACTICAL DETECTION IN HUMAN SERUM, AND IT CAN AVOID INTERFERENCE FROM ITS SISTER ENZYME (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE) AND GLUTATHIONE AT THE MICROMOLAR LEVEL. THE PRESENTED RESULTS PROVIDE A CLUE FOR THE FUNCTIONALIZATION OF S-DOTS, AND OFFER A POWERFUL TOOL AS AN ANALYTIC TECHNIQUE FOR NANOMEDICINE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE.

ANIMALS WERE DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS: SALINE, SALINE PLUS TYLOXAPOL, AND   EXTRACT PLUS TYLOXAPOL. ANIMALS WERE TREATED FOR 15¬ÄâDAYS WITH A SALINE SOLUTION OR   FRUIT EXTRACT AND AFTER HYPERLIPIDAEMIA WAS INDUCED BY TYLOXAPOL.  TREATMENT WITH   EXTRACT REDUCED SERUM TRIGLYCERIDE, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, AND ADENOSINE DEAMINASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES WHEN COMPARED TO THE TYLOXAPOL GROUP. HDL-CHOLESTEROL AND PARAOXONASE 1 ACTIVITY WERE HIGHER IN   EXTRACT TREATED ANIMALS WHEN COMPARED TO TYLOXAPOL-TREATED ANIMALS. NO DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN HEPATIC OXIDATIVE STRESS PARAMETERS. PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS PRESENT IN   FRUIT EXTRACT WERE IDENTIFIED AND QUANTIFIED BY LC-MS/MS.  THESE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT PHENOLIC RICH   EXTRACT HAS HYPOLIPIDEMIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS IN HYPERLIPIDEMIC RATS.

TO FIGHT THE DISEASE, NATURAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MULBERRY, WITH ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES AND INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST KEY ENZYMES (ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND BETA-SECRETASE 1 (BACE-1)) ARE OF INTEREST. HOWEVER, EVEN IN THE SAME CULTIVARS, MULBERRY TREES GROWN IN DIFFERENT POPULATED LOCATIONS MIGHT POSSESS DISPARATE AMOUNTS OF PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILES, LEADING TO DISSIMILAR HEALTH PROPERTIES, WHICH CAUSE PROBLEMS WHEN COMPARING DIFFERENT CULTIVARS OF MULBERRY. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO COMPARATIVELY INVESTIGATE THE PHYTOCHEMICALS, ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES, AND INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST ACHE, BCHE, AND BACE-1, OF TWENTY-SEVEN   SPP. CULTIVATED IN THE SAME PLANTING AREA IN THAILAND. THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT   FRUIT SAMPLES WERE RICH IN PHENOLICS, ESPECIALLY CYANIDIN, KUROMANIN, AND KERACYANIN. BESIDES, THE AQUEOUS   FRUIT EXTRACTS EXHIBITED ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES, BOTH IN SINGLE ELECTRON TRANSFER (SET) AND HYDROGEN ATOM TRANSFER (HAT) MECHANISMS, WHILE STRONG INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES AGAINST AD KEY ENZYMES WERE OBSERVED.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE NEUROPROTECTIVE PROPERTIES OF   AND   USING TRANSGENIC   FLIES (TDMF). THE ACTIVITY OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AS WELL AS THE ANTIOXIDANT STATUS OF TDMF RAISED ON A DIET SUPPLEMENTED WITH   AND   WERE DETERMINED. THE FLIES WERE RAISED ON A DIET DEVOID OF SUPPLEMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTED WITH   OR   (1% AND 5% INCLUSION) FOR 7¬ÄâDAYS. AFTERWARD, ACHE AND BCHE ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS CATALASE AND TOTAL THIOL LEVEL, WERE DETERMINED. THE REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) AND MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) LEVELS WERE ALSO DETERMINED IN THE FLIES RAISED ON A DIET DEVOID OF SUPPLEMENT AND ON SUPPLEMENTED DIETS. MEANWHILE, FLIES RAISED ON   AND  SUPPLEMENTED DIETS EXHIBITED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE ACTIVITY OF ACHE AND BCHE IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTROLS. ALSO, SUPPLEMENTED DIETS SIGNIFICANTLY ( ¬Äâ<¬Äâ0.05) ENHANCE CATALASE ACTIVITY AND IMPROVE TOTAL THIOL LEVEL, WHILE ROS AND MDA LEVELS WERE OBSERVED TO BE REDUCED IN ALL THE FLIES RAISED ON THE SUPPLEMENTED DIETS IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTROLS. IN SUMMARY, REDUCTION IN THE ACTIVITY OF ACHE AND BCHE, AS WELL AS IMPROVED ANTIOXIDANT STATUS IN TDMF, COULD BE SOME OF THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH   AND   EXHIBIT ANTI-AD PROPERTIES.

THE BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND ANTICANCER, ANTIOXIDANT, AND ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF THE EXTRACTS WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED. THE BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN THE EXTRACTS WERE DETERMINED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY. THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WAS EVALUATED BY 1,1-DIPHENYL-2-PICRYLHYDRAZYL (DPPH), 2,2'-AZINO-BIS(3-ETHYLBENZOTHIAZOLINE-6 SULPHONIC ACID) (ABTS) RADICAL SCAVENGING, TOTAL PHENOL AND FLAVONOID CONTENT, FERRIC REDUCING POWER, AND IRON CHELATING METHOD. THE ANTICANCER, ANTICHOLINESTERASE, AND ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS WERE INVESTIGATED USING THE XTT ASSAY, ELLMAN METHOD, AND MICRODILUTION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT BETWEEN THE WATER AND METHANOL EXTRACTS THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. THE ANTIOXIDANT RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT BOTH EXTRACTS HAVE STRONG ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY. SIMILARLY, BOTH EXTRACTS SHOWED STRONG Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE AND Œ±-AMYLASE INHIBITION ACTIVITY, WHILE THE WATER EXTRACT HAD HIGHER INHIBITION ACTIVITY THAN THE METHANOL EXTRACT AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE.

DIFFERENT FACTORS ARE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AD, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN THE CHOLINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION LEVEL. THE AMARYLLIDACEAE PLANT FAMILY CONTAINS AN EXCLUSIVE, LARGE, AND STILL UNDERSTUDIED ALKALOID GROUP CHARACTERIZED BY A SINGULAR SKELETON ARRANGEMENT AND A BROAD SPECTRUM OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. THE CHEMISTRY AND BIODIVERSITY OF ECUADORIAN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE   GENUS (AMARYLLIDACEAE) HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY STUDIED. IN THIS WORK, FIVE ECUADORIAN   SPECIES WERE EXAMINED IN VITRO FOR THEIR ACTIVITY TOWARDS THE ENZYMES ACETYL- (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE), AND THE ALKALOID PROFILE OF BULB EXTRACTS WAS ANALYZED BY GC-MS. THE SPECIES   AND   SHOWED THE MOST ACHE AND BUCHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY. TO OBTAIN INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE IDENTIFIED ALKALOIDS IN THESE INHIBITORY EFFECTS, DOCKING EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT, AND CANTABRICINE SHOWED IN SILICO INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST BOTH CHOLINESTERASE STRUCTURES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT AMARYLLIDACEAE SPECIES FROM ECUADOR ARE A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF NEW DRUGS FOR THE PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF AD.

TOTAL BIOACTIVE CONTENTS WERE DETERMINED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY, AND THE INDIVIDUAL SECONDARY METABOLITES COMPOSITION WAS ASSESSED   ULTRA-HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS SPECTROMETRY (UHPLC-MS) ANALYSIS. ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITIES WERE EVALUATED USING A PANOPLY OF ASSAYS (2,2-DIPHENYL-1-PICRYLHYDRAZYL (DPPH), 2,2'-AZINO-BIS (3-ETHYLBENZOTHIAZOLINE-6-SULFONIC ACID) (ABTS) FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING, FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER (FRAP), CUPRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER (CUPRAC), PHOSPHOMOLYBDENUM TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (TAC), AND METAL CHELATING ACTIVITY (MCA)). THE ENZYME INHIBITION POTENTIAL WAS STUDIED AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), Œ±-AMYLASE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, TYROSINASE, UREASE AND LIPOXYGENASE (LOX) ENZYMES. THE METHANOL EXTRACT WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN HIGHER TOTAL PHENOLIC (105.91¬ÄâMG GAE/G EXTRACT) AND FLAVONOID (2.27¬ÄâMG RE/G EXTRACT) CONTENTS WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ITS MORE SUBSTANTIAL ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL AS WELL AS ACHE, BCHE, TYROSINASE AND Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITION. HOWEVER, THE DCM EXTRACT WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGAINST Œ±-AMYLASE (1.86¬ÄâMMOL ACAE/G EXTRACT) ENZYME INHIBITION. THE UHPLC-MS ANALYSIS OF METHANOL EXTRACT IDENTIFIED THE TENTATIVE PRESENCE OF A TOTAL OF 18 SECONDARY METABOLITES, INCLUDING FLAVONOIDS, SAPONINS, PHENOLIC AND TERPENOID DERIVATIVES. THREE COMPOUNDS NAMED EMMOTIN A, LUTEOLIN 5,3'-DIMETHYL ETHER, AND PREFERRUGONE WERE FURTHER INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR   MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDIES AGAINST THE TESTED ENZYMES. THE SELECTED COMPOUNDS WERE FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER BINDING INTERACTION WITH ACHE FOLLOWED BY BCHE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, Œ±-AMYLASE, AND TYROSINASE. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED   TO BE CONSIDERED AS A LEAD SOURCE OF NATURAL ANTIOXIDANT AND ENZYME INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS.

IN THIS WORK, WE CONDUCTED A DETAILED STUDY ON A PHENOMENON OF THIOL INHIBITION OF MERCURY (HG ) COLD VAPOR GENERATION (CVG) AND FOUND  -CYSTEINE ( -CYS), GLUTATHIONE (GSH), DITHIOTHREITOL, N-ACETYL-L-CYSTEINE, 3-MERCAPTOPROPIONIC ACID, Œ≤-MERCAPTOETHANOL, AND NAI CAN INHIBIT THE CVG OF HG , WHILE EDTA HAS NO INHIBITORY EFFECT. FURTHERMORE, CHANGING THE CONTENT OF -SH CAN EFFECTIVELY ADJUST THE CVG ATOMIC FLUORESCENCE SPECTROMETER (CVG-AFS) SIGNAL OF HG . AS AS A CONSEQUENCE, AN AS-BASED HOMOGENEOUS BIOASSAY WAS CONSTRUCTED BY ADJUSTING THE OXIDATION RATIO AND PRODUCTION QUANTITY OF -SH IN THE SYSTEM. THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM WAS DEMONSTRATED BY USING AFS AS A REPRESENTATIVE DETECTOR. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H O ) AND GLUCOSE WERE USED AS REPRESENTATIVE ANALYTES FOR THE VALIDATION OF HG  ATOMIC FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL TURN-OFF STRATEGY, AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) AS WELL AS PARATHION (ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES, OPS) AS UTILIZED AS REPRESENTATIVE TARGETS FOR THE SIGNAL TURN-ON STRATEGY. UNDER OPTIMAL EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, THE HOMOGENEOUS CVG-AFS SENSOR CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY USED TO DETECT 3¬†ŒºM¬†H O , 30¬†ŒºM GLUCOSE, 0.25 U/L BCHE, AND 0.4¬†ŒºG/ML PARATHION. IN ADDITION, THE DETECTION RESULTS OF GLUCOSE AND BCHE IN HUMAN SERUM SAMPLES AGREED WELL WITH THOSE OBTAINED BY USING GLUCOMETER AND KIT, SHOWING THE PROMISING POTENTIAL OF THIS METHOD FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS. THEREFORE, THIS WORK PROVIDES A PERSPECTIVE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AS-BASED HOMOGENEOUS BIOASSAYS AND SHOWS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE DETECTION OF BIOMARKERS.

HOWEVER, THERE IS A DEARTH OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING ITS POSSIBLE ACTIVITY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, AND SKIN HYPERPIGMENTATION DISORDERS. THIS STUDY THEREFORE ATTEMPTED TO ELUCIDATE THE IN VITRO INHIBITORY ACTION OF ETHYL ACETATE, METHANOL, AND WATER EXTRACTS OF   STEM BARK (PA-SB) ON Œ±-AMYLASE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE, AND TYROSINASE. CELL VIABILITY, CATECHOLAMINE, AND 3-HYDROXYKYNURENINE LEVELS OF HYPOTHALAMIC HYPOE22 CELLS EXPOSED TO PA-SB EXTRACTS WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED. THE PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILES OF THE EXTRACTS WERE DETERMINED BY HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC) AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES WERE INVESTIGATED. SAPONIN (867.42 MG QUILLAJA EQUIVALENT/G) AND TANNIN (33.81 MG CATECHIN EQUIVALENT/G) CONTENTS WERE HIGHER IN THE METHANOL EXTRACT. MULTIPLE DIHYDROXY-TRIMETHOXY(ISO)FLAVONE ISOMERS, LOLIOLIDE, ERIODICTYOL, NARINGENIN, LUTEOLIN, CHRYSOERIOL, APIGENIN, AND LIQUIRITIGENIN, WERE CHARACTERIZED FROM PA-SB EXTRACTS USING HPLC. THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF PA-SB SHOWED HIGHEST INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (4.88 MG GALANTAMINE EQUIVALENT (GALAE)/G EXTRACT), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (5.37 MG GALAE/G EXTRACT), AND TYROSINASE (154.86 MG KOJIC ACID EQUIVALENT/G EXTRACT) WHILE Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE WAS EFFECTIVELY INHIBITED BY THE ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACT (15.22 MMOL ACARBOSE EQUIVALENT/G EXTRACT). THE METHANOL EXTRACT OF PA-SB ALSO SHOWED POTENT ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES (493.87, 818.12, 953.07, AND 732.19 MG TROLOX EQUIVALENT/G EXTRACT, FOR 1,1-DIPHENYL-2-PICRYLHYDRAZYL (DPPH), 2,2'-AZINO-BIS(3-ETHYLBENZOTHIAZOLINE-6-SULPHONIC ACID (ABTS), CUPRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (CUPRAC), AND FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER (FRAP) ASSAYS, RESPECTIVELY). PA-SB EXTRACTS EXHIBITED ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY AND PROMISING INHIBITION AGAINST KEY ENZYMES RELATED TO TYPE II DIABETES, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, AND SKIN HYPERPIGMENTATION DISORDERS. ADDITIONALLY, ALL EXTRACTS WERE ABLE TO CONTRAST HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS, IN HYPOE22 CELLS, THUS RESTORING BASAL CATECHOLAMINE AND 3-HYDROXYKINURENINE LEVELS, WHEREAS ONLY METHANOL AND WATER EXTRACTS STIMULATED BASAL DOPAMINE RELEASE.

DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD USE OF DIVERSE ALLOPATHIC DRUGS, THESE BRAIN-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS CAN ONLY BE PARTIALLY ADDRESSED AND LONG TERM TREATMENT IS OFTEN LINKED WITH DEPENDENCY AND OTHER UNWANTED SIDE EFFECTS. NATURE, BELIEVED TO BE AN ARSENAL OF REMEDIES FOR ANY ILLNESS, PRESENTS AN INTERESTING AVENUE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENTS. INTERESTINGLY, INHIBITION OF CHOLINESTERASES, INVOLVED IN THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE IN THE SYNAPTIC CLEFT, HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO BE NEUROPROTECTIVE. THIS REVIEW THEREFORE AIMS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT VIA DOCKING STUDIES OF PREVIOUSLY STUDIED COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE SHOWN POTENT ACTIVITY AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) IN VITRO. INDEED, THE DETERMINATION OF POTENT PLANT-BASED LIGANDS FOR THIS PURPOSE THROUGH IN SILICO METHODS ENABLES THE ELIMINATION OF LENGTHY AND COSTLY TRADITIONAL METHODS OF DRUG DISCOVERY. HEREIN, A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY ACTIVE PHYTOCHEMICALS WHICH ARE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. FOLLOWING WHICH IN SILICO DOCKING METHODS WERE APPLIED TO OBTAIN DOCKING SCORES. COMPOUND STRUCTURES WERE EXTRACTED FROM ONLINE ZINC DATABASE AND OPTIMIZED USING AM1 IMPLEMENTED IN GAUSSIAN09 SOFTWARE. NOTEWORTHY LIGANDS AGAINST ACHE HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS STUDY INCLUDE: 19,20-DIHYDROERVAHANINE A AND 19, 20-DIHYDROTABERNAMINE. REGARDING BCHE INHIBITION, THE BEST LIGANDS WERE FOUND TO BE 8-CLAVANDURYLKAEMPFEROL, NA-METHYLEPIPACHYSAMINE D; EBEIEDINONE; AND DICTYOPHLEBINE. THUS, LIGAND OPTIMIZATION BETWEEN SUCH PHYTOCHEMICALS AND CHOLINESTERASES COUPLED WITH IN VITRO, IN VIVO STUDIES AND RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS CAN LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL DRUGS AGAINST NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS.

IT IS, THEREFORE, SOMETIMES VALUABLE TO HAVE A SECOND LOOK AT "OLD" DIFFRACTION DATA, ESPECIALLY WHEN EARLIER INTERPRETATION OF THE ELECTRON DENSITY MAPS WAS RATHER DIFFICULT. HERE, WE PRESENT UPDATED CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF   ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ( ACHE) ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN [HAREL ET AL., PROT SCI (2000) 9:1063-1072], WHICH REVEAL FEATURES PREVIOUSLY UNNOTICED. THUS, PREVIOUSLY UNMODELED DENSITY IN THE NATIVE ACTIVE SITE CAN BE INTERPRETED AS STABLE ACETYLATION OF THE CATALYTIC SERINE. SIMILARLY, A STRONG DENSITY IN THE  ACHE/ZA COMPLEX ORIGINALLY ATTRIBUTED TO A SULFATE ION IS BETTER INTERPRETED AS A SMALL MOLECULE THAT IS COVALENTLY BOUND. THIS SMALL MOLECULE CAN BE MODELED AS EITHER A PROPIONATE OR A GLYCINATE. THE COMPLEX IS REMINISCENT OF THE CARBOXYLATE BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE COMPLEXES OBSERVED IN CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASES FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, AND DEMONSTRATES THE REMARKABLE ABILITY OF CHOLINESTERASES TO STABILIZE COVALENT COMPLEXES WITH CARBOXYLATES. A VERY STRONG PEAK OF DENSITY (10 œÉ) AT COVALENT DISTANCE FROM THE CŒ≤ OF THE CATALYTIC SERINE IS PRESENT IN THE  ACHE/ZAI COMPLEX. THIS CAN BE UNDOUBTEDLY ATTRIBUTED TO AN IODINE ATOM, SUGGESTING AN UNANTICIPATED IODO/HYDROXYL EXCHANGE BETWEEN SER238 AND THE INHIBITOR, POSSIBLY DRIVEN BY THE INTENSE X-RAY IRRADIATION. FINALLY, THE BINDING OF TACRINE-DERIVED INHIBITORS, SUCH AS ZA (1DX4) OR THE IODINATED ANALOG, ZAI (1QON) RESULTS IN THE APPEARANCE OF AN OPEN CHANNEL THAT CONNECTS THE BASE OF THE ACTIVE-SITE GORGE TO THE SOLVENT. THIS CHANNEL, WHICH ARISES DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE CONSERVED TYROSINE PRESENT IN VERTEBRATE CHOLINESTERASES, COULD BE EXPLOITED TO DESIGN INHIBITORS SPECIFIC TO INSECT CHOLINESTERASES. THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT UPDATED PROCESSING OF OLDER DIFFRACTION IMAGES, AND THE RE-REFINEMENT OF OLDER DIFFRACTION DATA, CAN PRODUCE VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT COULD NOT BE DETECTED IN THE ORIGINAL ANALYSIS, AND STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE PRESERVATION OF THE DIFFRACTION IMAGES IN PUBLIC DATA BANKS.

HOWEVER, THERE ARE GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING THE MULTIPLE TARGETS, PATHWAYS, AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF   ALKALOIDS. BY CONSTRUCTING THE INTERACTIONS AMONG DRUG-TARGETS-DISEASES, NETWORK PHARMACOLOGY PROVIDES A SYSTEMIC METHODOLOGY AND A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE TO PRESENT THE INTRICATE CONNECTIONS AMONG DRUGS, POTENTIAL TARGETS, AND RELATED PATHWAYS. IT IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR STUDYING TCM DRUGS WITH MULTIPLE INDICATIONS, AND HOW THESE MULTI-INDICATION DRUGS ARE AFFECTED BY COMPLEX INTERACTIONS IN THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS AND TARGETS OF   ALKALOIDS, WE BUILT AN INTEGRATED ANALYTICAL PLATFORM BASED ON NETWORK PHARMACOLOGY, INCLUDING TARGET PREDICTION, PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION (PPI) NETWORK, TOPOLOGY ANALYSIS, GENE ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS, AND MOLECULAR DOCKING. USING THIS PLATFORM, WE REVEALED THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF   ALKALOIDS' ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE EFFECTS AND EXPLORED THE POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF   ALKALOIDS IN PREVENTING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. THESE RESULTS WERE FURTHER EVALUATED AND REFINED USING BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS. OUR STUDY PROVIDES A NOVEL STRATEGY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE HOLISTIC PHARMACOLOGY OF TCM, AS WELL AS FOR EXPLORING THE MULTI-INDICATION PROPERTIES OF TCM BEYOND ITS TRADITIONAL APPLICATIONS.

THEIR CYTOTOXICITY WAS INVESTIGATED IN HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONAL CELL LINES (HT22). THE REDUCED GLUTATHIONE LEVEL, SOD AND CATALASE ACTIVITIES WERE¬†AMELIORATED IN TISSUES TREATED WITH THE PHENOLICS, WITH CONCOMITANT DEPLETION OF MALONDIALDEHYDE AND NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS. THEY INHIBITED ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITIES, WHILE CONCOMITANTLY ELEVATED ATPASE ACTIVITY. TREATMENT WITH VANILLIN LED TO RESTORATION OF OXIDATIVE-DEPLETED METABOLITES AND REACTIVATION OF THE PENTOSE PHOSPHATE AND PURINE METABOLISM PATHWAYS, WITH CONCOMITANT ACTIVATION OF PATHWAYS FOR HISTIDINE AND SELENOAMINO METABOLISMS. WHILE VANILLIC ACID RESTORED AND REACTIVATED OXIDATIVE-DEPLETED METABOLITES AND PATHWAYS BUT DID NOT ACTIVATE ANY ADDITIONAL PATHWAY. BOTH PHENOLICS PORTRAYED GOOD BINDING¬†AFFINITY FOR CATALASE, WITH VANILLIC ACID HAVING¬†THE HIGHER BINDING ENERGY OF -7.0¬†KCAL/MOL. BOTH PHENOLICS WERE NOT CYTOTOXIC ON HT22 CELLS, AND THEIR TOXICITY CLASS WERE PREDICTED TO BE 4. ONLY VANILLIN WAS PREDICTED TO BE PERMEABLE ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER (BBB). THESE RESULTS INSINUATE THAT VANILLIN AND VANILLIC ACID CONFER A NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT ON OXIDATIVE BRAIN DAMAGE, WHEN VANILLIN BEING THE MOST POTENT.

DURING OUR SEARCH FOR NEW INHIBITORS OF CHOLINESTERASE ENZYMES FROM NATURAL SOURCES, THE ETHYL ACETATE (ETOAC) EXTRACT OF   JACQ WAS IDENTIFIED AS A DUAL CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR WITH IC  VALUES OF 2.7 AND 11.4 ŒºG/ML AGAINST ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), RESPECTIVELY. THE PHYTOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE ETOAC EXTRACT HAS RESULTED IN ISOLATION OF FOUR ANTHRAQUINONES, NAMELY, HELMINTHOSPORIN, EMODIN, CHRYSOPHANOL, AND PHYSCION, AMONGST WHICH THE HELMINTHOSPORIN HAS BEEN ISOLATED FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM   SP. ALL ISOLATED SECONDARY METABOLITES HAVE DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANT INHIBITION OF EEACHE WITH IC  VALUES OF 2.63, 15.21, 33.7, AND 12.16 ŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE HELMINTHOSPORIN WAS ALSO FOUND TO INHIBIT BCHE WITH AN IC  VALUE OF 2.99 ŒºM. THE ENZYME KINETIC STUDY HAS INDICATED THAT HELMINTHOSPORIN INHIBITS ACHE AND BCHE IN A NONCOMPETITIVE MANNER WITH   VALUES OF 10.3 AND 12.3 ŒºM, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS OF MOLECULAR MODELING AND PROPIDIUM IODIDE DISPLACEMENT ASSAY HAVE REVEALED THAT HELMINTHOSPORIN OCCUPIES THE PERIPHERAL ANIONIC SITE OF THE ACTIVE SITE GORGE OF ACHE. IN THE PAMPA-BBB PERMEABILITY ASSAY, HELMINTHOSPORIN WAS FOUND TO POSSESS HIGH BBB PERMEABILITY (  = 6.16 √ó 10  CM/S). IN A NUTSHELL, HELMINTHOSPORIN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A BRAIN PERMEABLE DUAL CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR, AND THUS ITS FURTHER SYNTHETIC EXPLORATION IS WARRANTED FOR OPTIMIZATION OF ITS POTENCY.

THIS STUDY WAS INTENDED TO INVESTIGATE THE NEUROPROTECTIVE ACTIVITY OF THE TWO ESSENTIAL OILS (EOS) FROM IRANIAN   (PK) LEAVES AND ALLIUM SATIVUM (AS) CLOVES AGAINST Œ≤-AMYLOID 25-35 (AŒ≤25-35) INDUCED ELEVATION OF CHOLINESTERASE ENZYMES IN AD. THE EOS OF PK (PKEO) AND AS (ASEO) WERE PREPARED AND ANALYZED IN TERMS OF EXTRACTION YIELD, PHENOLIC CONTENT, AND CHOLINERGIC MARKERS IN VITRO. MOREOVER, BOTH WERE ADMINISTERED ORALLY TO ADULT MALE WISTAR RATS AT CONCENTRATIONS OF 1, 2, AND 3%. THE INHIBITORY POTENTIAL OF PKEO AND ASEO WAS COMPARED WITH DONEPEZIL (0.75 MG/KG) AGAINST THE HIGH ACTIVITIES OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ENZYMES. PKEO REACHED AN INHIBITION RATE OF 83.6% AND 81.4% AGAINST ACHE AND BCHE, RESPECTIVELY. ASEO HAD LOWER ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY (65.4% AND 31.5% FOR THE INHIBITION ACHE AND BCHE). PKEO WAS FOUND TO HAVE MORE PHENOLIC CONTENT THAN ASEO. A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TOTAL PHENOLICS AND ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE POTENTIAL. IN RATS, BOTH EOS DECREASED THE ENZYME ACTIVITY IN A CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT MANNER. AS COMPARED WITH DONEPEZIL, THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE ACHE AND BCHE INHIBITION OCCURRED AS RATS WERE TREATED WITH PKEO 3% (P < 0.05). IT COULD BE CONCLUDED THAT PKEO AND ASEO ARE POTENT INHIBITORS OF ACHE AND BCHE IN RATS THAT HOLD PROMISE TO BE USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF AD.

THEY WERE EVALUATED FOR IN VITRO INHIBITION OF ACHE FROM ELECTRIC EEL AND BUCHE FROM EQUINE SERUM USING MODIFIED ELLMAN'S SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC METHOD. THE BENZAMIDES EXHIBITED A MODERATE INHIBITION OF ACHE WITH IC  VALUES IN A NARROW CONCENTRATION RANGE FROM 33.1 TO 85.8 ¬µM. IC  VALUES FOR BUCHE WERE HIGHER (53.5-228.4 ¬µM). THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVES INHIBIT ACHE MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN BUCHE AND ARE COMPARABLE OR SUPERIOR TO RIVASTIGMINE-AN ESTABLISHED CHOLINESTERASES INHIBITOR USED IN THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

THEREAFTER, ENZYMATIC INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES (Œ±-AMYLASE, Œ±-GLUCOSIDASE, TYROSINASE, ACETYL- (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), LIPASE, AND ELASTASE) WERE ASSESSED. THE TOTAL PHENOLIC, FLAVONOID, PHENOLIC ACID, TANNIN, FLAVANOL AND TRITERPENOID CONTENT WERE ESTIMATED USING STANDARD ASSAYS. AN UNTARGETED METABOLOMICS-BASED APPROACH, BASED ON ULTRA-HIGH-PRESSURE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO QUADRUPOLE-TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) FOLLOWED BY MULTIVARIATE STATISTICS, WAS THEN USED TO COMPREHENSIVELY PROFILE AND DESCRIBE THE PHENOLICS PRESENT.

HOWEVER, RESEARCH FOCUSED ON ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) PROPERTIES OF SWEET PEPPERS IS LIMITED. THUS, THIS STUDY AIMED INVESTIGATE BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS (FLAVONOIDS, PHENOLIC ACIDS, AND CAROTENOIDS), ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY AND ANTI-AD PROPERTIES OF FOUR COLORED SWEET PEPPERS (GREEN, RED, ORANGE, AND YELLOW) VIA THEIR ABILITIES TO INHIBIT KEY ENZYMES RELEVANT TO AD [ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE), AND Œ≤-SECRETASE (BACE1)]. EXTRACTION SOLVENTS [HEXANE, ETHYL ACETATE, AND 70% (V/V) AQUEOUS ETHANOL] WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED. RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT YELLOW SWEET PEPPER HAVE THE HIGHEST CONTENT OF FLAVONOIDS, WHILE GREEN SWEET PEPPER HAVE THE HIGHEST CONTENTS OF PHENOLIC ACIDS AND RED SWEET PEPPERS HAVE THE HIGHEST CONTENT OF CAROTENOIDS. IN TERMS OF ANTI-AD PROPERTIES, GREEN SWEET PEPPERS EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST ANTIOXIDANT, ANTI-BCHE, AND ANTI-BACE1 ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, YELLOW SWEET PEPPER EXTRACT EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF ACHE INHIBITION. BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN SWEET RED PEPPERS MAY THEREFORE HAVE ANTI-AD PROPERTIES, AND MAY BE USEFUL FOR AD PREVENTION.

ONLY A FEW DRUGS HAVE BEEN APPROVED TO TREAT AD DEMENTIA OVER THE PAST CENTURY SINCE THE FIRST AD PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED. DRUGS INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS AT SYNAPSES IN THE BRAIN ARE USED CLINICALLY IN THE TREATMENT OF AD DEMENTIA, AND CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS (CHEIS) ARE THE MAINSTAY OF THE THERAPY. A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION HAS BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS WITH PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) BY CHEIS AND REDUCED BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BCHE) ACTIVITY DUE TO THE SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS. THE BCHE K-VARIANT (RS1803274), THE MOST COMMON GENETIC VARIANT OF THE   GENE, WAS THOUGHT TO REDUCE ENZYME ACTIVITY REFLECTING THE LOWER CLINICAL RESPONSE TO RIVASTIGMINE IN AD PATIENTS. DURING CHEIS THERAPY, PATIENTS CARRYING REDUCED-ACTIVITY BCHE DO NOT PRESENT SUCH IMPROVED ATTENTION LIKE PATIENTS WITH THE WILD-TYPE ENZYME. ON THE OTHER HAND, ALTERATIONS IN THE   GENE CAUSING ENZYME ACTIVITY REDUCTION MAY DELAY AD ONSET IN PATIENTS AT RISK BY PRESERVING THE LEVEL OF CORTICAL ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH). BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS RESULTS, WE CONCLUDE THAT SNPS LOCALIZED OUTSIDE OF THE CODING SEQUENCE, IN 5'UTR (RS1126680) AND/OR INTRON 2 (RS55781031) OF THE   GENE, BUT NOT SOLELY K-VARIANT ALTERATION (P.A539T) ITSELF, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REDUCED ENZYME ACTIVITY. THEREFORE, WE SUSPECT THAT NOT BCHE-K ITSELF, BUT THESE COEXISTING SNPS (RS1126680 AND RS55781031), COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH DELETERIOUS CHANGES IN COGNITIVE DECLINE IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH CHEIS. BASED ON THE RESULTS, WE SUGGEST THAT SNPS (RS1126680) AND/OR (RS55781031) GENOTYPING SHOULD BE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY SUBJECTS AT RISK FOR LOWERED EFFICACY CHEIS THERAPY, AND SUCH PATIENTS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH A LOWER RIVASTIGMINE DOSAGE. FINALLY, OUR SEQUENCE ANALYSIS OF THE N-TERMINAL END OF N-BCHE REVEALED EVOLUTIONARILY CONSERVED AMINO ACID RESIDUES THAT CAN BE INVOLVED IN DISULFIDE BOND FORMATION AND ANCHORING OF N-BCHE IN THE CELL MEMBRANE.

ELUFIOYE TO;CHINAKA CG;OYEDEJI AO NA ANTIOXIDANTS (BASEL) 2076-3921 8 NA 2019 10.3390/antiox8090400  HAS BEEN USED IN MANY TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE FOR ITS ANTI-HEMORRHAGIC, ANTIDIABETIC, ANTI-ULCER, AND ANTI-DIARRHEA PROPERTIES. THE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE (BUCHE) INHIBITIONS OF THE CRUDE METHANOL EXTRACTS AND ITS VARIOUS PARTITIONED FRACTIONS WERE DETERMINED BY A MODIFIED METHOD OF ELLMAN. AN EVALUATION OF THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WAS CARRIED OUT USING 1,1-DIPHENYL-2-PICRYL-HYDRAZYL (DPPH) RADICAL SCAVENGING, FERRIC REDUCING POWER, AND NITRIC OXIDE SCAVENGING ASSAYS. THE TOTAL FLAVONOIDS WERE ESTIMATED BASED ON THE ALUMINUM CHLORIDE METHOD, WHILE THE TOTAL TANNINS AND PHENOLICS WERE ESTIMATED BASED ON THE VANILLIN-HCL AND FOLIN-CIOCALTEU METHOD, RESPECTIVELY. THE ETHYL ACETATE FRACTION HAD THE HIGHEST DPPH RADICAL SCAVENGING ACTIVITY, AND THE HIGHEST FERRIC REDUCING POWER WITH A CONCENTRATION PROVIDING 50% INHIBITION (IC ) OF 0.079 MG/ML AND 0.078 MG/ML, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE CRUDE METHANOL EXTRACT HAD THE HIGHEST NITRIC OXIDE SCAVENGING ACTIVITY WITH AN IC  OF 0.008 MG/ML. THE METHANOL EXTRACT HAD THE HIGHEST PHENOLICS AND FLAVONOIDS CONTENTS, WHILE THE AQUEOUS FRACTION HAD THE HIGHEST TANNIN CONTENT. THE CRUDE METHANOL EXTRACT HAD THE BEST ACHE AND BUCHE INHIBITORY ACTION, WITH AN IC  OF 0.556 ¬µG/ML AND 5.541 ¬µG/ML, RESPECTIVELY, SUGGESTING THAT THE PLANT HAD A BETTER ACHE INHIBITING POTENTIAL. A MODERATE CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE PHENOLIC CONTENT AND DPPH RADICAL SCAVENGING, NO RADICAL SCAVENGING, AND ACHE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES (  = 0.439, 0.430, AND 0.439, RESPECTIVELY), WHILE A HIGH CORRELATION WAS SEEN BETWEEN THE FLAVONOID CONTENT AND THESE ACTIVITIES (  = 0.695, 0.724, AND 0.730, RESPECTIVELY), AND THE FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER CORRELATED HIGHLY WITH THE PROAUTOCYANIDIN CONTENT (  = 0.801).

WHEREAS OTHER BCHE ACTIVE SITE/PROXIMAL MUTATIONS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED, NONE ARE SUFFICIENTLY ACTIVE TO BE PROPHYLACTICALLY USEFUL. IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT COMPUTER SIMULATIONS DRIVEN STRATEGY, WE IDENTIFIED A SURFACE PEPTIDE LOOP (RESIDUES 278-285) EXHIBITING DYNAMIC MOTIONS DURING CATALYSIS AND MODIFIED IT VIA RESIDUE INSERTIONS. WE EVALUATED THESE LOOP MUTANTS USING COMPUTER SIMULATIONS, SUBSTRATE KINETICS, RESISTANCE TO INHIBITION, AND ENZYME REACTIVATION ASSAYS USING BOTH THE CHOLINE ESTER AND OP SUBSTRATES. A SLIGHT BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN REACTIVATION WAS NOTED WITH PARAOXON WITH ONE OF THE MUTANTS, AND CHANGES IN   AND CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY WERE NOTED IN OTHERS. SIMULATIONS SUGGESTED WEAKER INTERACTIONS BETWEEN OP VERSUS CHOLINE SUBSTRATES AND THE ACTIVE SITE OF ALL ENGINEERED VERSIONS OF THE ENZYME. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPROVEMENT OF OP ANTICHOLINESTERASE HYDROLYSIS THROUGH SURFACE LOOP ENGINEERING MAY BE A MORE EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN AN ENZYME WITH HIGHER INTRINSIC OP COMPOUND HYDROLASE ACTIVITY.
