TI  - Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency.
PG  - 279-85
LID - 10.1684/abc.2016.1141 [doi]
AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8; BChE) is a sister enzyme of acetylcholinesterase. 
      Though BChE lacks obvious physiological functions, it is of toxicological and 
      pharmacological importance in detoxifying or catabolising ester-containing drugs. 
      Furthermore, individuals deficient in BChE appear asymptomatic, apart from a 
      heightened sensitivity to the muscle relaxants suxamethonium and mivacurium, two 
      BChE substrates used as myorelaxant. Although many acquired conditions may affect 
      BChE activity, BChE deficiency is mainly due to mutations in the BCHE gene (OMIM 
      177400). Currently, more than 70 natural mutations have been documented in human 
      BCHE. They have an adverse effect on BChE activity by affecting the catalytic 
      functioning or the protein expression. However, the atypical variant (rs1799807) is 
      the most frequently involved in prolonged apnea.

TI  - Human butyrylcholinesterase efficacy against nerve agent exposure.
LID - 10.1002/jbt.21886 [doi]
AB  - Acetylcholinesterase is vital for normal operation of many processes in the body. 
      Following exposure to organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents, death can ensue without 
      immediate medical intervention. Current therapies mitigate the cholinergic crisis 
      caused by nerve agents but do not fully prevent long-term health concerns, for 
      example, brain damage following seizures. Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is a 
      stoichiometric bioscavenger being investigated as an antidote for OP nerve agent 
      poisoning. HuBChE sequesters OP nerve agent in the bloodstream preventing the nerve 
      agent from reaching critical target organ systems. HuBChE was effective when used as 
      both a pre-treatment and as a post-exposure therapy. HuBChE has potential for use in 
      both military settings and to protect civilian first responders in situations where 
      nerve agent usage is suspected. We reviewed various animal models studies evaluating 
      the efficacy of HuBChE against nerve agent exposure, pursuant to its submission for 
      approval under the FDA Animal Rule.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) has obtained a renewed interest as 
      therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD), when changes in BuChE activity and 
      expression along disease progression were highlighted as well as correlation between 
      BuChE levels and cognitive function. AREAS COVERED: During the last eight years, 
      fourteen patents on BuChE inhibitors (BuChEI) have been submitted. Only three of 
      them relate to BuChE selective inhibitors, while four of them focus on multitarget 
      inhibitors which address different key pathological factors other than BuChE. Two 
      patents report on non-selective acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/BuChE inhibitors, while 
      four patents deal with natural compounds and their derivatives. One patent relates 
      to antitoxic agents to treat exposure to ChEI pesticides and nerve agents. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Increasing evidence supports BuChE as a more beneficial target in 
      moderate-to-severe forms of AD in comparison to the well-known AChE. However, 
      hitting a single pathological target is likely not sufficient to halt the disease 
      progression. Therefore, patented BuChE inhibitors with a multifunctional profile may 
      open new therapeutic avenues, since the additional activities could reinforce the 
      therapeutic effects. Unfortunately, in vivo studies are limited and key parameters, 
      such as ADMET data, are missing. This lack of information makes difficult to 
      forecast the development of patented BuChEIs into effective drug candidates.

AB  - Two cholinesterases exist: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase 
      (BChE). While AChE plays a crucial role in neurotransmissions, BChE has no specific 
      function apart from the detoxification of some drugs and secondary metabolites from 
      plants. Thus, both AChE and BChE can serve as biochemical markers of various 
      pathologies. Poisoning by nerve agents like sarin, soman, tabun, VX, novichok and 
      overdosing by drugs used in some neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer´s 
      disease and myasthenia gravis, as well as poisoning by organophosphorus pesticides 
      are relevant to this issue. But it appears that changes in these enzymes take place 
      in other processes including oxidative stress, inflammation, some types of cancer 
      and genetically conditioned diseases. In this review, the cholinesterases are 
      introduced, the mechanism of inhibitors action is explained and the relations 
      between the cholinesterases and pathologies are explained.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (E.C. 3.1.1.8) purified from blood plasma has previously 
      been shown to provide protection against up to five and a half times the median 
      lethal dose of an organophosphorus nerve agent in several animal models. In this 
      study the stoichiometric nature of the protection afforded by human 
      butyrylcholinesterase against organophosphorus nerve agents was investigated in 
      guinea pigs. Animals were administered human butyrylcholinesterase 
      (26.15 mg/kg ≡ 308 nmol/kg) by the intravascular or intramuscular route. Animals 
      were subsequently dosed with either soman or VX in accordance with a stage-wise 
      adaptive dose design to estimate the modified median lethal dose in treated animals. 
      Human butyrylcholinesterase (308 nmol/kg) increased the median lethal dose of soman 
      from 154 nmol/kg to 770 nmol/kg. Comparing the molar ratio of agent molecules to 
      enzyme active sites yielded a stoichiometric protective ratio of 2:1 for soman, 
      likely related to the similar stereoselectivity the enzyme has compared to the toxic 
      target, acetylcholinesterase. In contrast, human butyrylcholinesterase (308 nmol/kg) 
      increased the median lethal dose of VX from 30 nmol/kg to 312 nmol/kg, resulting in 
      a stoichiometric protective ratio of only 1:1, suggesting a lack of 
      stereoselectivity for this agent.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is under development for use as a pretreatment 
      antidote against nerve agent toxicity. Animals are used to evaluate the efficacy of 
      HuBChE for protection against organophosphorus nerve agents. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      of HuBChE in minipigs showed a mean residence time of 267 h, similar to the 
      half-life of HuBChE in humans, suggesting a high degree of similarity between BChE 
      from 2 sources. Our aim was to compare the biochemical properties of PoBChE purified 
      from porcine milk to HuBChE purified from human plasma. PoBChE hydrolyzed 
      acetylthiocholine slightly faster than butyrylthiocholine, but was sensitive to 
      BChE-specific inhibitors. PoBChE was 50-fold less sensitive to inhibition by DFP 
      than HuBChE and 5-fold slower to reactivate in the presence of 2-PAM. The amino acid 
      sequence of PoBChE determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was 
      91% identical to HuBChE. Monoclonal antibodies 11D8, mAb2, and 3E8 (HAH 002) 
      recognized both PoBChE and HuBChE. Assembly of 4 identical subunits into tetramers 
      occurred by noncovalent interaction with polyproline-rich peptides in PoBChE as well 
      as in HuBChE, though the set of polyproline-rich peptides in milk-derived PoBChE was 
      different from the set in plasma-derived HuBChE tetramers. It was concluded that the 
      esterase isolated from porcine milk is PoBChE.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase is a promiscuous enzyme that displays complex kinetic 
      behavior. It is toxicologically important because it detoxifies organophosphorus 
      poisons (OP) by making a covalent bond with the OP. The OP and the 
      butyrylcholinesterase are both inactivated in the process. Inactivation of 
      butyrylcholinesterase has no adverse effects. However, inactivation of 
      acetylcholinesterase in nerve synapses can be lethal. OP-inhibited 
      butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase can be reactivated with oximes 
      provided the OP has not aged. Strategies for preventing the toxicity of OP include 
      (a) treatment with an OP scavenger, (b) reaction of non-aged enzyme with oximes, (c) 
      reactivation of aged enzyme, (d) slowing down aging with peripheral site ligands, 
      and (e) design of mutants that rapidly hydrolyze OP. Option (a) has progressed 
      through phase I clinical trials with human butyrylcholinesterase. Option (b) is in 
      routine clinical use. The others are at the basic research level. 
      Butyrylcholinesterase displays complex kinetic behavior including activation by 
      positively charged esters, ability to hydrolyze amides, and a lag time (hysteresis) 
      preceding hydrolysis of benzoylcholine and N-methylindoxyl acetate. Mass 
      spectrometry has identified new OP binding motifs on tyrosine and lysine in proteins 
      that have no active site serine. It is proposed, but not yet proven, that low dose 
      exposure involves OP modification of proteins that have no active site serine.

PG  - 726-34
AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an enzyme expressed in multiple organs and abundant 
      in plasma. BChE can fluctuate in course of several reasons while both 
      hypercholiensterasemia and hypocholinesterasemia are known. Considering evidence of 
      BChE activity alterations, hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic liver diseases and 
      poisoning with carbamates or organophosphates can be diagnosed by activity assay. 
      BChE is responsible for detoxification reactions, and the compounds such as cocaine, 
      succinylcholine, and acetylsalicylic acid are degraded in the body. The 
      detoxification can be slowed in patients carrying the K variant of the enzyme. 
      Summarization of literature, discussion on the meaning of BChE in the body, and the 
      principles of BChE assay in samples are described in the review (Tab. 2, Fig. 8, 
      Ref. 86). Text in PDF www.elis.sk.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a serine hydrolase widely distributed throughout the 
      body. It provides protection against administrated or inhaled poisons by hydrolyzing 
      or sequestering the toxic compounds. The most frequent genetic variant of BCHE gene 
      - K variant (p.A539T) is located in the C-terminal tetramerization domain, outside 
      of the catalytic center. Many studies tried to reveal the nature of the lower 
      activity of BChE K-variant but results and conclusions were often contradictory. The 
      aim of this study is to estimate K allele frequency and its coexisting alterations 
      in BCHE gene in a population of 162 individuals, as well as, assess influence on the 
      enzyme activity in serum. We present three haplotypes of BChE-K variant, two of them 
      coexist in strong linkage disequilibrium with alterations in 5'UTR (rs1126680), 
      intron 2 (rs55781031) or in exon 2 (rs1799807). We demonstrate a negative role of 
      these alterations on enzyme activity. By oneself BCHE-K (with no other alterations 
      in BCHE gene) haplotype exhibits wild type enzyme activity. Based on our previous 
      and presented results we conclude that SNPs localized outside the coding sequence, 
      in 5'UTR or/and in intron 2 of BCHE gene, but not solely in K-variant alteration 
      (p.A539T) itself, are responsible for reduced enzyme activity.

AB  - Activation of human butyrylcholinesterase by small quaternary ammonium ions is 
      known. Here, additional ligands in this series are presented: edrophonium and 
      choline, and the reactivator pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride. Kinetic analysis of 
      the progress curves with these compounds indicates the mechanism of enhanced 
      deacylation by the ligand bound to the catalytic anionic site (Trp82) at the base of 
      the active site. The larger, bis-quaternary ligands examined, as propidium, 
      hexamethonium, decamethonium, and bis-thiocholine, show only competitive inhibition 
      of butyrylcholinesterase, by preventing substrate approach. This hypothesis of 
      enhanced deacylation was tested for reactivation of 
      methanesulfonylfluoride-inactivated butyrylcholinesterase, a complex analogous to 
      organophosphate-aged cholinesterases. The combination of substrate/products and 
      pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride improved butyrylcholinesterase activity over 2 h 
      of continuous measurements, before which time substrate depletion prevailed. Similar 
      reactivation of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase was unsuccessful, but both 
      of these cholinesterases regain some activity if they have been inhibited and aged 
      for days by diisopropylfluorophosphate.

      ortho-positioned chlorine moiety, analogous to previously known K027, K048 and K203 
      oximes, and potent reactivators of human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited by 
      nerve agents, were tested in the reactivation of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
      inhibited by sarin, cyclosarin, VX, and tabun. A previously highlighted AChE 
      reactivator, dichlorinated bispyridinium oxime with propyl linker (K868), was tested 
      in more detail for reactivation of four nerve agent-BChE conjugates. Its BChE 
      reactivation potency was showed to be promising when compared to the standard oximes 
      used in medical practice, asoxime (HI-6) and pralidoxime (2-PAM), especially in case 
      of sarin and tabun. This finding could be used in the pseudo-catalytic scavenging of 
      the most nerve agents due to its cumulative capacity to reactivate both AChE and 
      BChE.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) protects from nerve agent toxicity. Our goal 
      was to determine whether bovine serum could be used as a source of BChE. Bovine BChE 
      (BoBChE) was immunopurified from 100 mL fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 380 mL adult 
      bovine serum by binding to immobilized monoclonal mAb2. Bound proteins were digested 
      with trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The 
      results proved that FBS and adult bovine serum contain BoBChE. The concentration of 
      BoBChE was estimated to be 0.04 μg/mL in FBS, and 0.03 μg/mL in adult bovine serum, 
      values lower than the 4 μg/mL BChE in human serum. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis 
      showed that monoclonal mAb2 bound BoBChE but not bovine acetylcholinesterase 
      (BoAChE) and confirmed that FBS contains BoBChE and BoAChE. Recombinant bovine BChE 
      (rBoBChE) expressed in serum-free culture medium spontaneously reactivated from 
      inhibition by chlorpyrifos oxon at a rate of 0.0023 min(-1) (t(1/2) = 301 min(-1)) 
      and aged at a rate of 0.0138 min(-1) (t(1/2) = 50 min(-1)). Both BoBChE and HuBChE 
      have 574 amino acids per subunit and 90% sequence identity. However, the apparent 
      size of serum BoBChE and rBoBChE tetramers was much greater than the 340,000 Da of 
      HuBChE tetramers. Whereas HuBChE tetramers include short polyproline rich peptides 
      derived from lamellipodin, no polyproline peptides have been identified in BoBChE. 
      We hypothesize that BoBChE tetramers use a large polyproline-rich protein to 
      organize subunits into a tetramer and that the low concentration of BoBChE in serum 
      is explained by limited quantities of an unidentified polyproline-rich protein.

AB  - While acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) has a clearly defined role in 
      neurotransmission, the functions of its sister enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (EC 
      3.1.1.8) are more obscure. Numerous mutations, many inactivating, are observed in 
      the human butyrylcholinesterase gene, and the butyrylcholinesterase knockout mouse 
      has an essentially normal phenotype, suggesting that the enzyme may be redundant. 
      Yet the gene has survived for many millions of years since the duplication of an 
      ancestral acetylcholinesterase early in vertebrate evolution. In this paper, we ask 
      the questions: why has butyrylcholinesterase been retained, and why are inactivating 
      mutations apparently tolerated? Butyrylcholinesterase has diverged both structurally 
      and in terms of tissue and cellular expression patterns from acetylcholinesterase. 
      Butyrylcholinesterase-like activity and enzymes have arisen a number of times in the 
      animal kingdom, suggesting the usefulness of such enzymes. Analysis of the published 
      literature suggests that butyrylcholinesterase has specific roles in detoxification 
      as well as in neurotransmission, both in the brain, where it appears to control 
      certain areas and functions, and in the neuromuscular junction, where its function 
      appears to complement that of acetylcholinesterase. An analysis of the mutations in 
      human butyrylcholinesterase and their relation to the enzyme's structure is shown. 
      In conclusion, it appears that the structure of butyrylcholinesterase's catalytic 
      apparatus is a compromise between the apparently conflicting selective demands of a 
      more generalised detoxifier and the necessity for maintaining high catalytic 
      efficiency. It is also possible that the tolerance of mutation in human 
      butyrylcholinesterase is a consequence of the detoxification function. 
      Butyrylcholinesterase appears to be a good example of a gene that has survived by 
      subfunctionalisation.

AB  - Affinity chromatography on procainamide-Sepharose has been an important step in the 
      purification of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) since 
      its introduction in 1978. The procainamide affinity gel has limitations. In the 
      present report a new affinity gel called Hupresin® was evaluated for its ability to 
      purify truncated, recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (rHuBChE) expressed in a 
      stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line. We present a detailed example of 
      the purification of rHuBChE secreted into 3940 mL of serum-free culture medium. The 
      starting material contained 13,163 units of BChE activity (20.9 mg). rHuBChE was 
      purified to homogeneity in a single step by passage over 82 mL of Hupresin® eluted 
      with 0.1 M tetramethylammonium bromide in 20 mM TrisCl pH 7.5. The fraction with the 
      highest specific activity of 630 units/mg contained 11 mg of BChE. Hupresin® is 
      superior to procainamide-Sepharose for purification of BChE, but is not suitable for 
      purifying native AChE because Hupresin® binds AChE so tightly that AChE is not 
      released with buffers, but is desorbed with denaturing solvents such as 50% 
      acetonitrile or 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Procainamide-Sepharose will continue to be 
      useful for purification of AChE.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders 
      with notable factor of dysfunction in cholinergic system. Low ACh level can be 
      observed in the pathogenesis of AD. Several AChE inhibitors have already been used 
      for clinical treatments. However, other than normal conditions, ACh is mostly 
      hydrolyzed by BuChE in progressed AD. Account for an increased level of BuChE and 
      decreased level of AChE in the late stage of AD, development of selective BuChE 
      inhibitor is of vital importance. Up till now, compounds with various scaffolds have 
      been discovered to selectively inhibit BuChE. Different effective anti-BuChE 
      molecules are concluded in this review.

AB  - Encouraged by the in vitro potent inhibitory activity on butyrylcholinesterase 
      (BChE) of 95% ethanol extract of Cremastra appendiculata (D. Don) Makino tubers, a 
      further phytochemical investigation on C. appendiculata tubers was conducted, which 
      led to the isolation of a pair of new biphenanthrene atropisomers, namely 
      cremaphenanthrene F-G (1-2). Their structures were elucidated on the basis of 
      extensive spectroscopic analyses and chemical method. It is the first time that 
      biphenanthrene atropisomers have been isolated from the plant kingdom. Compound 1 
      showed potent BChE inhibitory effect with IC(50) value of 14.62 ± 2.15 μM. Compound 
      2 exhibited weak BChE inhibitory effect with IC(50) value of 79.56 ± 0.78 μM. 
      Meanwhile, 1 and 2 were found to be inactive for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
      inhibition. These findings suggested that compound 1 was a promising selective BChE 
      inhibitor for AD prevention and treatment.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has long been regarded as an "orphan enzyme" with no 
      specific physiological role other than to metabolize exogenous bioactive esters in 
      the diet or in medicines. Human beings with genetic mutations that eliminate all 
      BChE activity appear completely normal, and BChE-knockout mice have been described 
      as "lacking a phenotype" except for faster weight gain on high-fat diets. However, 
      our recent studies with viral gene transfer of BChE in mice reveal that BChE 
      hydrolyzes the so-called "hunger hormone," ghrelin, at a rate which strongly affects 
      the circulating levels of this peptide hormone. This action has important 
      consequences for weight gain and fat metabolism. Surprisingly, it also impacts 
      emotional behaviors such as aggression. Overexpression of BChE leads to low ghrelin 
      levels in the blood stream and reduces aggression and social stress in mice. Under 
      certain circumstances these combined effects contribute to increased life-span in 
      group-housed animals. These findings may generalize to humans, as recent clinical 
      studies by multiple investigators indicate that, among patients with severe 
      cardiovascular disease, longevity correlates with increasing levels of plasma BChE 
      activity.

AB  - A computer-designed mutant of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), N322E/E325G, with 
      a novel catalytic triad was made. The catalytic triad of the wild-type enzyme 
      (S198·H438·E325) was replaced by S198·H438·N322E in silico. Molecular dynamics for 
      1.5 μs and Markov state model analysis showed that the new catalytic triad should be 
      operative in the mutant enzyme, suggesting functionality. QM/MM modeling performed 
      for the reaction of wild-type BChE and double mutant with echothiophate showed high 
      reactivity of the mutant towards the organophosphate. A truncated monomeric (L530 
      stop) double mutant was expressed in Expi293 cells. Non-purified transfected cell 
      culture medium was analyzed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under native 
      conditions followed by activity staining with BTC as the substrate provided evidence 
      that the monomeric BChE mutant was active. Inhibition of the double mutant by 
      echothiophate followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and activity staining 
      showed that this enzyme slowly self-reactivated. However, because Expi293 cells 
      secrete an endogenous BChE tetramer and several organophosphate-reacting enzymes, 
      catalytic parameters and self-reactivation constants after phosphorylation of the 
      new mutant were not determined in the crude cell culture medium. The study shows 
      that the computer-designed double mutant (N322E/E325G) with a new catalytic triad 
      (S198·H438·N322E) is a suitable template for design of novel active human BChE 
      mutants that display an organophosphate hydrolase activity.

TI  - Triterpene-Based Carboxamides Act as Good Inhibitors of Butyrylcholinesterase.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24050948 [doi]
LID - 948
AB  - A set of overall 40 carboxamides was prepared from five different natural occurring 
      triterpenoids including oleanolic, ursolic, maslinic, betulinic, and platanic acid. 
      All of which were derived from ethylene diamine holding an additional substituent 
      connected to the ethylene diamine group. These derivatives were evaluated regarding 
      their inhibitory activity of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
      butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) employing Ellman's assay. We further determined the 
      type of inhibition and inhibition constants. Carboxamides derived from platanic acid 
      have been shown to be potent and selective BChE inhibitors. Especially the 
      mixed-type inhibitor 
      (3β)-N-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethyl)-3-acetyloxy-20-oxo-30-norlupan-28-amide (35) showed 
      a remarkably low K(i) of 0.07 ± 0.01 µM (K(i)' = 2.38 ± 0.48 µM) for the inhibition 
      of BChE.

TI  - Profiling Auspicious Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity of Two Herbal 
      Molecules: Hyperforin and Hyuganin C.

AB  - Cholinergic therapy based on cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory drugs is the mainstay 
      for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, an extensive research has been 
      continuing for the discovery of drug candidates as inhibitors of acetyl- and 
      butyrylcholinesterase. In this study, two natural molecules, e. g. hyperforin and 
      hyuganin C were tested in vitro for their AChE and BChE inhibitory activity. Both of 
      the compounds were ineffective against AChE, whereas hyperforin (IC(50) 
      =141.60±3.39 μm) and hyuganin C (IC(50) =38.86±1.69 μm) were found to be the highly 
      active inhibitors of BChE as compared to galantamine (IC(50) =46.58±0.91 μm) which 
      was used as the reference. Then, these molecules were further proceeded to molecular 
      docking experiments in order to establish their interactions at the active site of 
      BChE. The molecular docking results indicated that both of them are able to block 
      the access to key residues in the catalytic triad of the enzyme, while they 
      complement some of the hydrophobic residues of the cavity, what is consistent with 
      our in vitro data. While both compounds were predicted as mutagenic, only hyuganin C 
      showed hepatotoxicity in in silico analysis. According to whole outcomes that we 
      obtained, particularly hyuganin C besides hyperforin are the promising BChE 
      inhibitors, which can be the promising compounds for AD therapy.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase is a nonspecific enzyme of clinical, pharmacological and 
      toxicological significance. Although the enzyme is relatively stable, its activity 
      is affected by numerous factors, including pressure. In this work, hydrostatic 
      pressure dependence of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in native and salted 
      human butyrylcholinesterase was studied up to the maximum pressure at ambient 
      temperature of about 1200 MPa. A correlated large shift toward long wavelengths and 
      broadening observed at pressures between 200 and 700 MPa was interpreted as due to 
      high pressure-induced denaturation of the protein, leading to an enhanced exposure 
      of tryptophan residues into polar solvent environment. This transient process in 
      native butyrylcholinesterase presumably involves conformational changes of the 
      enzyme at both tertiary and secondary structure levels. Pressure-induced mixing of 
      emitting local indole electronic transitions with quenching charge transfer states 
      likely describes the accompanying fluorescence quenching that reveals different 
      course from spectral changes. All the pressure-induced changes turned irreversible 
      after passing a mid-point pressure of about 400 ± 50 MPa. Addition of either 0.1 M 
      ammonium sulphate (a kosmotropic salt) or 0.1 M lithium thiocyanate (a chaotropic 
      salt) to native enzyme similarly destabilized its structure.

TI  - Discovery of Selective Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) Inhibitors through a Combination 
      of Computational Studies and Biological Evaluations.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24234217 [doi]
LID - 4217
AB  - As there are increased levels and activity of butyrylcholiesterase (BChE) in the 
      late stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), development of selective BChE inhibitors is 
      of vital importance. In this study, a workflow combining computational technologies 
      and biological assays were implemented to identify selective BChE inhibitors with 
      new chemical scaffolds. In particular, a pharmacophore model served as a 3D search 
      query to screen three compound collections containing 3.0 million compounds. 
      Molecular docking and cluster analysis were performed to increase the efficiency and 
      accuracy of virtual screening. Finally, 15 compounds were retained for biological 
      investigation. Results revealed that compounds 8 and 18 could potently and highly 
      selectively inhibit BChE activities (IC(50) values < 10 μM on human BChE, 
      selectivity index BChE > 30). These active compounds with novel scaffolds provided 
      us with a good starting point to further design potent and selective BChE 
      inhibitors, which may be beneficial for the treatment of AD.

AB  - We report herein the structure-based design and application of a fluorogenic 
      molecular probe (BChE-FP) specific to butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). This probe was 
      rationally designed by mimicking the native substrate and optimized stepwise by 
      manipulating the steric feature and the reactivity of the designed probe targeting 
      the structural difference of the active pockets of BChE and AChE. The refined probe, 
      BChE-FP, exhibits high specificity toward BChE compared to AChE, producing about 
      275-fold greater fluorescence enhancement upon the catalysis by BChE. Thus, BChE-FP 
      is a specific BChE probe identified by the structure-based design and it can 
      discriminate BChE from AChE. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied for 
      imaging the endogenous BChE in living cells, as well as BChE inhibitor screening and 
      characterization under physiological conditions.

TI  - Molecular characterization and polymorphisms of butyrylcholinesterase in cynomolgus 
      macaques.
PG  - 185-191
LID - 10.1111/jmp.12342 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), an enzyme essential for drug metabolism, 
      has been investigated as antidotes against organophosphorus nerve agents, and the 
      efficacy and safety have been studied in cynomolgus macaques. BChE polymorphisms 
      partly account for variable BChE activities among individuals in humans, but have 
      not been investigated in cynomolgus macaques. METHODS: Molecular characterization 
      was carried out by analyzing primary sequence, gene, tissue expression, and genetic 
      variants. RESULTS: In cynomolgus and human BChE, phylogenetically closely related, 
      amino acid residues important for enzyme function were conserved, and gene and 
      genomic structure were similar. Cynomolgus BChE mRNA was most abundantly expressed 
      in liver among the 10 tissue types analyzed. Re-sequencing found 26 non-synonymous 
      genetic variants in 121 cynomolgus and 23 rhesus macaques, indicating that macaque 
      BChE is polymorphic, although none of these variants corresponded to the null or 
      defective alleles of human BChE. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest molecular 
      similarities of cynomolgus and human BChE.

TI  - Identification of Carboxylesterase, Butyrylcholinesterase, Acetylcholinesterase, 
      Paraoxonase, and Albumin Pseudoesterase in Guinea Pig Plasma through Nondenaturing 
      Gel Electrophoresis.
PG  - 367-374
LID - 10.30802/AALAS-CM-18-000047 [doi]
AB  - Drugs to protect against nerve agent toxicity are tested in animals. The current 
      preferred small animal model is guinea pigs because their plasma bioscavenging 
      capacity resembles that of NHP. We stained nondenaturing polyacrylamide slab gels 
      with a variety of substrates, inhibitors, and antibodies to identify the esterases 
      in heparinized guinea pig plasma. An intense band of carboxylesterase activity 
      migrated behind albumin. Minor carboxylesterase bands were revealed after background 
      activity from paraoxonase was inhibited by using EDTA. The major 
      butyrylcholinesterase band was a disulfide-linked dimer. Incubation with the 
      antihuman butyrylcholinesterase antibody B2 18-5 shifted the butyrylcholinesterase 
      dimer band to slower migrating complexes. Carboxylesterases were distinguished from 
      butyrylcholinesterase by their sensitivity to inhibition by bis-p-nitrophenyl 
      phosphate. Acetylcholinesterase tetramers formed a complex with the antihuman 
      acetylcholinesterase antibody HR2. Organophosphorus toxicants including cresyl 
      saligenin phosphate, dichlorvos, and chlorpyrifos oxon irreversibly inhibited the 
      serine esterases but not paraoxonase. Albumin pseudoesterase activity was seen in 
      gels stained with α- or β-naphthyl acetate and fast blue RR. We conclude that guinea 
      pig plasma has 2 types of carboxylesterase, butyrylcholinesterase dimers and 5 minor 
      butyrylcholinesterase forms, a small amount of acetylcholinesterase tetramers, 
      paraoxonase, and albumin pseudoesterase activity. A knockout mouse with no 
      carboxylesterase activity in plasma is available and may prove to be a better model 
      for studies of nerve agent toxicology than guinea pigs.

TI  - Engineering Dynamic Surface Peptide Networks on Butyrylcholinesterase(G117H) for 
      Enhanced Organophosphosphorus Anticholinesterase Catalysis.
PG  - 1801-1810
LID - 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00146 [doi]
AB  - The single residue mutation of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE(G117H)) hydrolyzes a 
      number of organophosphosphorus (OP) anticholinesterases. Whereas other BChE active 
      site/proximal mutations have been investigated, none are sufficiently active to be 
      prophylactically useful. In a fundamentally different computer simulations driven 
      strategy, we identified a surface peptide loop (residues 278-285) exhibiting dynamic 
      motions during catalysis and modified it via residue insertions. We evaluated these 
      loop mutants using computer simulations, substrate kinetics, resistance to 
      inhibition, and enzyme reactivation assays using both the choline ester and OP 
      substrates. A slight but significant increase in reactivation was noted with 
      paraoxon with one of the mutants, and changes in K(M) and catalytic efficiency were 
      noted in others. Simulations suggested weaker interactions between OP versus choline 
      substrates and the active site of all engineered versions of the enzyme. The results 
      indicate that an improvement of OP anticholinesterase hydrolysis through surface 
      loop engineering may be a more effective strategy in an enzyme with higher intrinsic 
      OP compound hydrolase activity.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a widely distributed plasma enzyme. For 
      decades, numerous research efforts have been directed at engineering BChE as a 
      bioscavenger of organophosphorus insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents. 
      However, it has been a grand challenge to cost-efficiently produce BChE in 
      large-scale. Recently reported studies have successfully designed a truncated BChE 
      mutant (with amino-acid substitutions on 47 residues that are far away from the 
      catalytic site), denoted as BChE-M47 for convenience, which can be expressed in E. 
      coli without loss of its catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to dimerize the 
      truncated BChE mutant protein expressed in a prokaryotic system (E. coli) in order 
      to further improve its thermal stability by introducing a pair of cross-subunit 
      disulfide bonds to the BChE-M47 structure. Specifically, the E377C/A516C mutations 
      were designed and introduced to BChE-M47, and the obtained new protein entity, 
      denoted as BChE-M48, with a pair of cross-subunit disulfide bonds indeed exists as a 
      dimer with significantly improved thermostability and unaltered catalytic activity 
      and reactivity compared to BChE-M47. These results provide a new strategy for 
      optimizing protein stability for production in a cost-efficient prokaryotic system. 
      Our enzyme, BChE-M48, has a half-life of almost one week at a 37°C, suggesting that 
      it could be utilized as a highly stable bioscavenger of OP insecticides and chemical 
      warfare nerve agents.

AB  - The combination of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and nanomaterial-based quencher creates 
      an innovative method for sensors design. In this work, we report a fluorescent 
      sensing platform for sensitive detection of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The 
      fluorescence of AuNCs can be quenched by iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) nanomaterials. In 
      the presence of BChE and acetylthiocholine (ATCh), nano-FeOOH can be effectively 
      decomposed by the enzymatic hydrolysate (thiocholine), leading to the recovery of 
      AuNCs fluorescence. The Au/FeOOH exhibits the highest fluorescence quenching 
      efficiency compared with other transition metal oxyhydroxide-based sensing systems, 
      e.g., Au/CoOOH and Au/NiOOH. The corresponding fluorescence recovery efficiency is 
      also the best for Au/FeOOH. The large surface area of nanomaterials and thin 
      nanostructure provide a favorable platform for the reaction of enzymatic hydrolysate 
      and eventually improve the high sensitivity of the probe. A linear detection range 
      for BChE is achieved within 5-100 ng mL(-1) along with a detection limit of 4 ng 
      mL(-1). By taking advantage of the high sensitivity, the Au/FeOOH was successfully 
      used for BChE quantification in 2 μL of finger blood.

AB  - Eight derivatives of 4-aminoquinolines differing in the substituents attached to the 
      C(4)-amino group and C(7) were synthesised and tested as inhibitors of human 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Both enzymes were 
      inhibited by all of the compounds with inhibition constants (K(i)) ranging from 0.50 
      to 50 μM exhibiting slight selectivity toward AChE over BChE. The most potent 
      inhibitors of AChE were compounds with an n-octylamino chain or adamantyl group. The 
      shortening of the chain length resulted in a decrease in AChE inhibition by 5-20 
      times. Docking studies revealed that the quinoline group within the AChE active site 
      was positioned in the choline binding site, while the C(4)-amino group substituents, 
      depending on their lipophilicity, could establish hydrogen bonds or π-interactions 
      with residues of the peripheral anionic site. The most potent inhibitors of BChE 
      were compounds with the most voluminous substituent on C(4)-amino group (adamantyl) 
      or those with a stronger electron withdrawing substituent on C(7) (trifluormethyl 
      group). Based on AChE inhibition, compounds with an n-octylamino chain or adamantyl 
      substituent were shown to possess the capacity for further development as potential 
      drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Organophosphorus compounds (OP) pose a significant threat. Administration of human 
      butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) may reduce or prevent OP toxicity. Thus, we evaluated 
      the safety and efficacy of HuBChE in monkeys using sensitive neurobehavioral tests 
      while concurrently characterizing absorption and elimination in the presence and 
      absence of high-dose soman exposure to predict time course and degree of protection. 
      Eight young adult male cynomolgus macaques were trained on two distinct automated 
      tests of neurobehavioral functioning. HuBChE purified under current Good 
      Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) was injected intramuscularly at 13.1 mg/kg, producing 
      an average peak plasma value (Cmax) of over 27 Units/ml. The apparent time to 
      maximum concentration (Tmax) approximated 7 h, the elimination half-life 
      approximated 102 h, and plasma levels returned to pre-administration (baseline) 
      levels by 14 days. No behavioral disruptions following HuBChE administration were 
      observed on either neurobehavioral test, even in monkeys injected 24 h later with an 
      otherwise lethal dose of soman. Thus, HuBChE provided complete neurobehavioral 
      protection from soman challenge. The present data replicate and extend previous 
      results from our laboratory that had used a different route of administration 
      (intravenous), a different species (rhesus macaque), and a different BChE product 
      (non-CGMP material). The addition of two sensitive neurobehavioral tests coupled 
      with the PK/PD results convincingly demonstrates the neurobehavioral safety of 
      plasma-derived HuBChE at therapeutic levels. Protection against an otherwise-lethal 
      dose of soman by a pre-exposure treatment dose that is devoid of side effects 
      establishes a foundation for additional testing using other exposure routes and 
      treatment times, other challenge agents/routes, or other classes of organophosphate 
      scavengers.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are two enzymes 
      sensitive to various chemical compounds having ability to bind to crucial parts of 
      these enzymes. Boldine is a natural alkaloid and it was mentioned in some older 
      works that it can inhibit some kinds of AChE. We reinvestigated this effect on AChE 
      and also on BChE using acetyl (butyryl) thiocholine and Ellman's reagents as 
      standard substances for spectrophotometric assay. We found out IC(50) of AChE equal 
      to 372 μmol/l and a similar level to BChE, 321 μmol/l. We conclude our experiment by 
      a finding that boldine is cholinesterase inhibitor; however we report significantly 
      weaker inhibition than that suggested in literature. Likewise, we tried to 
      investigate the mechanism of inhibition and completed it with in silico study. 
      Potential toxic effect on cholinesterases in real conditions is also discussed.

AB  - Phenazines, naturally produced by bacteria and archaeal Methanosarcina species are 
      nitrogen-containing tricyclic molecules with antibiotic, antitumoral, and 
      antiparasitic activities. Phenazines are used as electron acceptors-donors in wide 
      range of fields including environmental biosensors. In this study, the inhibitory 
      effects of a synthetic phenazine dye, methylene violet 3RAX (also known as diethyl 
      safranine) on human erythrocyte AChE and human plasma BChE were tested and also its 
      inhibitory mechanisms for both enzymes were studied in detail. Kinetic analyses 
      showed that methylene violet 3RAX acts as a hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibitor of 
      AChE with K(i) value of 1.58 ± 0.36 μM; α = 1; β = 0.12 ± 0.0003. On the other hand, 
      it caused linear competitive inhibition of BChE with K(i) value of 0.51 ± 0.006 μM; 
      α = ∞. In conclusion, methylene violet 3RAX which is a highly effective inhibitor of 
      both human AChE and human BChE with K(i) values in low micromolar range may be a 
      promising candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is widely distributed in various tissues and highly 
      implicated in several important human diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      However, the role of BChE in AD is still controversial, which may be partially 
      attributed to the lack of a direct tool for real-time and noninvasive monitoring of 
      BChE in in vivo. Here, we report three rationally designed near-infrared fluorogenic 
      probes that possess excellent discrimination for butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) over 
      the related enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The refined probe, BChE-NIRFP, not 
      only functions as an exquisite substrate for BChE in in vitro assays but also 
      represents a superb "signal-on" imaging tool to real-time track BChE levels in human 
      cells, zebrafish, and a mouse model of AD. A further application of BChE-NIRFP to 
      identify the cellular mechanism reveals that Aβ fibrils and insulin resistance may 
      be important contributors to the abnormally elevated BChE levels observed during AD 
      progression. Based on the results from the present study, this new probe is a 
      valuable tool for basic and clinical research designed to obtain a complete 
      understanding of the physiological roles of BChE in diverse human diseases, 
      particularly AD.

AB  - Rare diseases defined by genetic mutations are classic targets for gene therapy. 
      More recently, researchers expanded the use of gene therapy in non-clinical studies 
      to infectious diseases through the delivery of vectorized antibodies to well-defined 
      antigens. Here, we further extend the utility of gene therapy beyond the "accepted" 
      indications to include organophosphate poisoning. There are no approved preventives 
      for the multi-organ damage resulting from acute or chronic exposure to 
      organophosphates. We show that a single intramuscular injection of adeno-associated 
      virus vector produces peak expression (~0.5 mg/ml) of active human 
      butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) in mice serum within 3-4 weeks post-treatment. This 
      expression is sustained for up to 140 days post-injection with no silencing. 
      Sustained expression of hBChE provided dose-dependent protection against VX in male 
      and female mice despite detectable antibodies to hBChE in some mice, thereby 
      demonstrating that expression of hBChE in vivo in mouse muscle is an effective 
      prophylactic against organophosphate poisoning.

AB  - The recent intentional use of nerve agents and pesticides in Europe and Afghanistan 
      highlights the need for an effective countermeasure against organophosphates (OP) 
      toxins. The most developed pretreatment candidate to date is plasma (native) human 
      butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE), which is limited in availability and because of its 
      1:1 stoichiometry with OPs, a large dose will present challenges when delivered 
      parenterally both in terms of pharmacokinetics and manageability in the field. A 
      tetrameric recombinant (r) form of human BChE produced in CHO-K1 cells with similar 
      structure, in vivo stability and antidotal efficacy as the native form, has been 
      developed to deliver rHuBChE as an aerosol (aer) to form a pulmonary bioshield 
      capable of neutralizing inhaled OPs in situ and prevent AChE inhibition in the blood 
      and in the brain; the latter associated with the symptoms of OP toxicity. Previous 
      proof-of-concept macaque studies demonstrated that delivery of 9 mg/kg using a 
      microsprayer inserted down the trachea, resulted in protection against an inhaled 
      dose of 15ug/kg of aer-paraoxon (aer-Px) given 72 h later. In the present studies, 
      pulmonary delivery of rHuBChE in macaques was achieved using Aerogen vibrating mesh 
      nebulizers, similar to that used for human self-administration. The promising 
      findings indicate that despite the poor lung deposition observed in macaques using 
      nebulizers (13-20%), protective levels of RBC-AChE were still present in the blood 
      even when exposure aer-Px (55 μg/kg) was delayed for five days. This long term 
      retention of 5 mg/kg rHuBChE deposited in the lung bodes well for the use of an 
      aer-rHuBChE pretreatment in humans where a user-friendly customized nebulizer with 
      increased lung deposition up to 50% will provide even longer protection at a lower 
      dose.

AB  - Non-specific binding of a fluorescent probe to human serum albumin is problematic 
      because it induces signal interference when the probe detects the target biomarker 
      in human serum. To eliminate this problem, we used intrinsically problematic 
      non-specific fluorescence in designing a fluorescent probe for butyrylcholinesterase 
      activity in serum. The probe containing a fluorophore with specific binding affinity 
      for albumin could sensitively detect butyrylcholinesterase activity in serum with 
      high selectivity to acetylcholinesterase and screen the efficiency of 
      butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) mutations common in the human population may result in 
      complete or partial BChE deficiency, making the BChE knockout (KO) mouse a model for 
      human deficiencies. The BChE KO mouse cannot tolerate standard doses of the muscle 
      relaxant succinylcholine or the Alzheimer's disease drugs huperzine A and donepezil. 
      It is resistant to the asthma drug bambuterol. The importance of BChE in 
      detoxication of cocaine has been demonstrated by hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity 
      in cocaine-challenged BChE KO mice. The BChE KO mouse becomes obese on a high-fat 
      diet, suggesting a role for BChE in fat metabolism. BChE serves as a backup for 
      acetylcholinesterase by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in 
      acetylcholinesterase knockout mice. Imaging studies show that BChE injected 
      intrathecally crosses the blood-brain barrier. Mice, but not humans, have 
      carboxylesterase in their blood. Carboxylesterase obscures the role of BChE in 
      detoxication of organophosphorus pesticides. Future studies will make a double 
      knockout that has neither BChE nor carboxylesterase. The double knockout is expected 
      to be unusually sensitive to the toxicity of organophosphorus pesticides. Knowledge 
      of drug sensitivities in the mouse model of human BChE deficiency will aid in 
      understanding adverse drug effects in humans.

AB  - A set of triterpenoids with different grades of oxidation in the lupane skeleton 
      were prepared and evaluated as cholinesterase inhibitors. Allylic oxidation with 
      selenium oxide and Jones's oxidation were employed to obtain mono-, di- and 
      tri-oxolupanes, starting from calenduladiol (1) and lupeol (3). All the derivatives 
      showed a selective inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase over acetylcholinesterase 
      (BChE vs. AChE). A kinetic study proved that compounds 2 and 9, the more potent 
      inhibitors of the series, act as competitive inhibitors. Molecular modeling was used 
      to understand their interaction with BChE, the role of carbonyl at C-16 and the 
      selectivity towards this enzyme over AChE. These results indicate that oxidation at 
      C-16 of the lupane skeleton is a key transformation in order to improve the 
      cholinesterase inhibition of these compounds.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is being developed as a therapeutic for 
      protection from the toxicity of nerve agents. An enriched source of HuBChE is Cohn 
      fraction IV-4 from pooled human plasma. For the past 40 years, purification of 
      HuBChE has included affinity chromatography on procainamide-Sepharose. The present 
      report supports a new affinity sorbent, Hupresin, for purification of HuBChE from 
      Cohn fraction IV-4. Nine batches of 70-80 kg frozen Cohn fraction were extracted 
      with water, filtered, and chromatographed on 30 L of Q-Ceramic ion exchange sorbent 
      at pH 4.5. The 4% pure Q-eluent was pumped onto 4.2 L Hupresin, where contaminants 
      were washed off with 0.3 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, before 99% pure 
      HuBChE was eluted with 0.1 M tetramethylammonium bromide. The average yield was 1.5 
      g of HuBChE from 80 kg Cohn paste. Recovery of HuBChE was reduced by 90% when the 
      paste was stored at -20°C for 1 year, and reduced 100% when stored at 4°C for 24h. 
      No reduction in HuBChE recovery occurred when paste was stored at -80°C for 3 months 
      or 3 years. Hupresin and procainamide-Sepharose were equally effective at purifying 
      HuBChE from Cohn fraction. HuBChE in Cohn fraction required 1000-fold purification 
      to attain 99% purity, but 15,000-fold purification when the starting material was 
      plasma. HuBChE (P06276) purified from Cohn fraction was a 340 kDa tetramer of 4 
      identical N-glycated subunits, stable for years in solution or as a lyophilized 
      product.

AB  - Addiction is a complex mental and behavioral disorder that changes the 
      neurochemistry and physiology of the brain. Genetics also plays a significant role 
      in the pathophysiology of addiction. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a cholinergic 
      enzyme, has been implicated in the metabolism of various drugs, including cocaine, 
      and an association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 
      butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE) and neuronal disorders has been reported. We 
      report here the first investigation to be conducted on the status of BChE activity 
      and the potential association of two BCHE gene SNPs, rs3495 (c.*189G > A) and 
      rs1803274 (c.1699G>A, p.Ala567Thr, K-variant), with addiction vulnerability in 
      heroin, hashish and polydrug users. Seventy-five individuals with an addiction to 
      heroin, hashish and/or polydrug use were recruited to this study. BChE levels in the 
      plasma were determined by Ellman's principle. SNPs were genotyped by standard 
      procedures, followed by Sanger sequencing. Plasma BChE levels were found to be 
      significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) in addicts (mean ± standard error of the mean 
      0.031 ± 0.004 μmol/L/min; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.024-0.038) than in 
      non-addicts (controls) (0.014 ± 0.001 μmol/L/min; 95% CI 0.012-0.017). Statistical 
      significant differences were also observed between the addicted cohorts. A 
      statistically significant association for both SNPs (rs3495 and rs1803274) was not 
      observed in addicted subjects tested in the dominant, recessive and allele genetic 
      models, but trends of variations of the rs3495 risk G allele were noted. The authors 
      conclude that BChE plays significant roles in addiction pathophysiology as increased 
      BChE activity in blood samples obtained from the cohorts with addiction was evident. 
      Further studies in this direction may provide novel approaches for the treatment of 
      addiction, but studies with a larger sample size and different ethnic groups are 
      warranted for broader conclusions to be drawn.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase as possible markers of low-grade 
      systemic inflammation.
PG  - RA214-21
AB  - Plasma levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 
      lipid peroxides are high whereas those of endothelial nitric oxide are low in 
      insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
      hyperlipidemias, metabolic syndrome X, and Alzheimer's disease suggesting that these 
      diseases are characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. Recent studies showed 
      that the plasma and tissue activities of enzymes butyrylcholinesterase and 
      acetylcholinesterase are elevated in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes 
      mellitus, hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. As a result of this 
      increase in the activities of enzymes acetylcholinesterase and 
      butyrylcholinesterase, the plasma and tissue levels of acetylcholine (ACh) will be 
      low. The "cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway" mediated by acetylcholine acts by 
      inhibiting the production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, macrophage 
      migration inhibitory factor, and high mobility group box-1 and suppresses the 
      activation of nuclear factor-kappa B expression. ACh is a neurotransmitter and 
      regulates the levels and activities of serotonin, dopamine and other neuropeptides 
      and thus, modulates both immune response and neurotransmission. Hence, both 
      acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase by inactivating acetylcholine may 
      enhance inflammation. This suggests that increased plasma and tissue activities of 
      acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase seen in various clinical conditions 
      could serve as a marker of low-grade systemic inflammation.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase may have a role in a number of metabolic functions and could 
      affect the expression of insulin resistance syndrome. We present our integrated work 
      using clinical, biochemical and bioinformatic approaches to delineate the possible 
      function of this enzyme. Initially, we constructed a phylogenic tree with 
      nucleotides and amino acid sequences and showed the existence of similar sequences 
      in bacteria, plants and in other animals. We also demonstrated a possible pathogenic 
      role for BChE in the common existence of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and 
      Alzheimer's disease by in silico method and followed it up with a diabetic mouse 
      study where cognition was slowed along with changes in BChE levels. In the next 
      group of in silico studies, we employed THEMATICS method to identify the amino acids 
      at the active site and later performed docking studies with drugs. THEMATICS 
      predicted two clusters of ionisable amino acid residues that are in proximity: one 
      with two residues and another with 11 showed perturbation in the THEMATICS curves. 
      Using ISIS/Draw 2.5SP4, ARGUSLAB 4.0.1 and HEX 5.1. software. 3-D ligands were 
      docked with BChE motif (from PDB). We did not find any of the ligands studied with 
      significant docking distance, indicating they did not have direct interaction with 
      the active site. Subsequently we performed in silico studies to compare the 
      secondary structure and domain of BChE. Protein-protein interaction showed the 
      following intersections with BChE UBE21, CHAT, APOE, AATF, DF ALDH9A1, PDHX, PONI 
      PSME3 and ATP6VOA2. The integrative physiological roles of proteins with poorly 
      known functions can be approached by generating leads in silico, which can be 
      studied in vivo, setting into movement an iterative process.

TI  - Chlorpyrifos Oxon-Induced Isopeptide Bond Formation in Human Butyrylcholinesterase.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25030533 [doi]
LID - 533
AB  - A newly recognized action of organophosphates (OP) is the ability to crosslink 
      proteins through an isopeptide bond. The first step in the mechanism is covalent 
      addition of the OP to the side chain of lysine. This activates OP-lysine for 
      reaction with a nearby glutamic or aspartic acid to make a gamma glutamyl epsilon 
      lysine bond. Crosslinked proteins are high molecular weight aggregates. Our goal was 
      to identify the residues in the human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) tetramer that 
      were crosslinked following treatment with 1.5 mM chlorpyrifos oxon. High molecular 
      weight bands were visualized on an SDS gel. Proteins in the gel bands were digested 
      with trypsin, separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed in an Orbitrap mass 
      spectrometer. MSMS files were searched for crosslinked peptides using the Batch-Tag 
      program in Protein Prospector. MSMS spectra were manually evaluated for the presence 
      of ions that supported the crosslinks. The crosslink between Lys544 in 
      VLEMTGNIDEAEWEWK(544)AGFHR and Glu542 in VLEMTGNIDEAEWE(542)WK satisfied our 
      criteria including that of spatial proximity. Distances between Lys544 and Glu542 
      were 7.4 and 9.5 Å, calculated from the cryo-EM (electron microscopy) structure of 
      the HuBChE tetramer. Paraoxon ethyl, diazoxon, and dichlorvos had less pronounced 
      effects as visualized on SDS gels. Our proof-of-principle study provides evidence 
      that OP have the ability to crosslink proteins. If OP-induced protein crosslinking 
      occurs in the brain, OP exposure could be responsible for some cases of 
      neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - There is a dire need for new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Principal 
      drugs have reached maturity, and the number of people affected by AD is growing at a 
      rapid rate. After years of research and many clinical trials, only symptomatic 
      treatments are available. An effective disease-modifying drug for AD needs to be 
      discovered. The research presented in this paper aims to facilitate in the discovery 
      of new potential targets that could help in the ongoing AD research. Aryl 
      methanesulfonate derivatives were screened for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
      butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities. IC(50) values between 0.660 and 
      3.397 µM against AChE and 0.885 and 2.596 µM against BuChE were obtained.

AB  - Brain butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an attractive target for drugs designed for 
      the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its advanced stages. It also 
      potentially represents a biomarker for progression of this disease. Based on the 
      crystal structure of previously described highly potent, reversible, and selective 
      BChE inhibitors, we have developed the fluorescent probes that are selective towards 
      human BChE. The most promising probes also maintain their inhibition of BChE in the 
      low nanomolar range with high selectivity over acetylcholinesterase. Kinetic studies 
      of probes reveal a reversible mixed inhibition mechanism, with binding of these 
      fluorescent probes to both the free and acylated enzyme. Probes show 
      environment-sensitive emission, and additionally, one of them also shows significant 
      enhancement of fluorescence intensity upon binding to the active site of BChE. 
      Finally, the crystal structures of probes in complex with human BChE are reported, 
      which offer an excellent base for further development of this library of compounds.

AB  - Phase I clinical trials have shown that pure human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is 
      safe when administered to humans. A potential therapeutic use of BChE is for 
      prevention of nerve agent toxicity. A recombinant mutant of BChE that rapidly 
      inactivates cocaine is being developed as a treatment to help recovering cocaine 
      addicts avoid relapse into drug taking. These clinical applications rely on 
      knowledge of the structure, stability, and properties of BChE, information that is 
      reviewed here. Gene therapy with a vector that sustains expression for a year from a 
      single injection is a promising method for delivering therapeutic quantities of 
      BChE.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is considered a promising drug target as it plays an 
      important role in the progression of late stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two 
      compound libraries were selected and 64 124 amine containing moieties were screened 
      using a hierarchical virtual screening protocol to discover new selective BuChE 
      inhibitors. From these and subsequent docking experiments, 9-phenylacridinedione 
      (9-PAD) was identified as a promising scaffold for selective inhibition of BuChE. 
      Selected top dock scored 9-PADs were assayed and compounds 3 and 6 exhibited potent 
      and highly selective human BuChE inhibition (IC(50): 98 nM and 142 nM, 
      respectively). Both molecules were also predicted to show sufficient brain 
      permeability, not have any substantial toxicities, especially hepatotoxicity, and no 
      significant in vitro cytotoxicity against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at 
      concentrations up to 100 µM. These findings indicate that 9-PAD is a promising lead 
      structure for the development of agents able to treat late stage AD.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is a serine enzyme present in most organs and 
      plasma. No clear physiological function has yet been assigned to BuChE, but it is a 
      pharmacologically and toxicologically important enzyme that plays a role in 
      degradation of numerous ester-containing drugs and poisonous esters. Thus, 
      BuChE-based bioscavengers are an alternative for prophylaxis and treatments of 
      intoxications by these compounds. Also, BuChE has been integrated in biosensors for 
      detection of organophosphorus compounds and other cholinesterase inhibitors.

TI  - Synthesis and In Vitro Screening of Novel Heterocyclic β-d-Gluco- and

AB  - The development of selective butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors may improve the 
      treatment of Alzheimer's disease by increasing lower synaptic levels of the 
      neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase, as well 
      as by overexpressed BChE. An increase in the synaptic levels of acetylcholine leads 
      to normal cholinergic neurotransmission and improved cognitive functions. A series 
      of 14 novel heterocyclic β-d-gluco- and β-d-galactoconjugates were designed and 
      screened for inhibitory activity against BChE. In the kinetic studies, 4 out of 14 
      compounds showed an inhibitory effect towards BChE, with benzimidazolium and 
      1-benzylbenzimidazolium substituted β-d-gluco- and β-d-galacto-derivatives in a 
      10-50 micromolar range. The analysis performed by molecular modelling indicated key 
      residues of the BChE active site, which contributed to a higher affinity toward the 
      selected compounds. Sugar moiety in the inhibitor should enable better blood-brain 
      barrier permeability, and thus increase bioavailability in the central nervous 
      system of these compounds.

AB  - Organophosphates' toxic effect causes covalent binding to serine-198 in the active 
      site of human plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with loss of enzymatic function 
      (covalent inhibition). Mass spectrometric detection of modified FGESAGAAS peptide at 
      the active site is a powerful exposure biomarker tool. The aim of this study was to 
      develop mass spectrometry-based method for BChE adduct formation screening, avoiding 
      the use of standard peptides. Immunomagnetic separation of proteins from plasma was 
      optimized. Commercially available anti-butyrylcholinesterase monoclonal antibodies, 
      immobilized on magnetic beads, resulted in stable and reusable affinity sorbent. The 
      method was tested on horse serum BChE and real human plasma from healthy donors, 
      treated with Russian VX (VR). The BChE isolated from blood plasma was digested with 
      pepsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
      The method was evaluated by using synthetic peptides and by comparison to the 
      enzymatic activity Ellman's assay. The minimum concentration of VR exposure, 
      resulting in detectable VR-adduct, was 0.2 ng/mL, which corresponded to the relative 
      BChE inhibition of less than 2%. Adduct formation assessment was performed via 
      monitoring of decrease in non-modified peptide LC-MS/MS signal and increase in 
      VR-modified peptide signal. The designed approach was tested in a pilot study with 5 
      blood samples from healthy volunteers. Mass spectrometry-based method for BChE 
      adduct formation was found to be in agreement with Ellman's inhibition assay, so the 
      method is applicable for direct BChE inhibition assessment.

TI  - Butyrylcholinesterase regulates central ghrelin signaling and has an impact on food 
      intake and glucose homeostasis.
PG  - 1413-1419
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2017.123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is the only orexigenic hormone known to stimulate food intake 
      and promote obesity and insulin resistance. We recently showed that plasma ghrelin 
      is controlled by butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which has a strong impact on feeding 
      and weight gain. BChE knockout (KO) mice are prone to obesity on high-fat diet, but 
      hepatic BChE gene transfer rescues normal food intake and obesity resistance. 
      However, these mice lack brain BChE and still develop hyperinsulinemia and insulin 
      resistance, suggesting essential interactions between BChE and ghrelin within the 
      brain. METHODS: To test the hypothesis we used four experimental groups: (1) 
      untreated wild-type mice, (2) BChE KO mice with LUC delivered by adeno-associated 
      virus (AAV) in combined intravenous (i.v.) and intracerebral (i.c.) injections, (3) 
      KO mice given AAV for mouse BChE (i.v. only) and (4) KO mice given the same vector 
      both i.v. and i.c. All mice ate a 45% calorie high-fat diet from the age of 1 month. 
      Body weight, body composition, daily caloric intake and serum parameters were 
      monitored throughout, and glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were 
      performed at intervals. RESULTS: Circulating ghrelin levels dropped substantially in 
      the KO mice after i.v. AAV-BChE delivery, which led to normal food intake and 
      healthy body weight. BChE KO mice that received AAV-BChE through i.v. and i.c. 
      combined treatments not only resisted weight gain on high-fat diet but also retained 
      normal glucose and insulin tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a central 
      role for BChE in regulating both insulin and glucose homeostasis. BChE gene transfer 
      could be a useful therapy for complications linked to diet-induced obesity and 
      insulin resistance.

AB  - Detection tubes are small devices for the colorimetric enzymatic detection of 
      cholinesterase inhibitors such as sarin, soman, VX nerve agents and substances 
      denoted as Novichok. These detectors contain carriers in the form of pellets with 
      immobilized cholinesterase, substrate and detection reagent. Their advantages are 
      portability, sensitivity and simplicity, enabling fast detection of such compounds 
      from air and water in case of a terrorist attack or war. In general, maintaining the 
      stability of an enzyme for a longer time is very problematic; therefore, its further 
      enhancement is required for safety and financial reasons. In this study, the 
      stability of our patented carriers in the form of pellets with immobilized 
      butyrylcholinesterase containing an increasing amount of the unique sorbent 
      Neusilin(®) US2 was evaluated. The samples containing Neusilin maintained the 
      stability of the immobilized enzyme for a longer time even at higher temperature and 
      humidity than the currently commercially used carrier without Neusilin, allowing 
      improved detection of nerve agents.

AB  - Pteryxin is a dihydropyranocoumarin derivative found in Apiaceae family. In this 
      study, pteryxin, which was previously isolated from the fruits of Mutellina 
      purpurea, was investigated for its inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase 
      (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which are the key enzymes in the pathology 
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The compound was tested in vitro using ELISA microplate 
      reader at 100 μg/ml and found to cause 9.30 ± 1.86% and 91.62 ± 1.53% inhibition 
      against AChE and BChE, respectively. According to our results, pteryxin 
      (IC(50) = 12.96 ± 0.70 μg/ml) was found to be a more active inhibitor of BChE than 
      galanthamine (IC(50) = 22.16 ± 0.91 μg/ml; 81.93± 2.52% of inhibition at 100 μg/ml). 
      Further study on pteryxin using molecular docking experiments revealed different 
      possible binding modes with both polar and hydrophobic interactions inside the 
      binding pocket of BChE. Top docking solution points out to the formation of two 
      hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues S198 and H438 of BChE as well as a strong 
      π - π stacking with W231. Therefore, pteryxin as a natural coumarin seems to be a 
      strong BChE inhibitor, which could be considered as a lead compound to develop novel 
      BChE inhibitors for AD treatment.

TI  - Plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity: a possible biomarker for differential 
      diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies?
PG  - 1082-1086
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2017.1329203 [doi]
AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an enzyme encoded by BCHE gene, responsible for 
      secondary hydrolysis of the acetylcholine. K and -116A BCHE variants were associated 
      with decrease in plasma BChE activity, and their influence has been investigated in 
      diseases with a cholinergic deficit such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia 
      with Lewy bodies (DLB). In order to check the influence of BCHE genetic variants on 
      enzymatic activity, all patients and controls were genotyped for K and -116A 
      variants. We found lower plasma BChE activity in DLB patients compared to elderly 
      controls and to AD independent of the presence of K or -116A variants. Our results 
      suggest that the reduction of total plasma BChE activity is probably associated with 
      a feedback mechanism and provides a future perspective of using this enzyme as a 
      possible plasmatic marker for differential diagnosis between AD and DLB.

TI  - Alanine-to-threonine substitutions and amyloid diseases: butyrylcholinesterase as a 
      case study.
PG  - 64-71
LID - 10.1016/j.cbi.2010.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Alanine-to-threonine (A to T) substitutions caused by single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) occur in diverse proteins, and in certain cases these 
      substitutions induce self-aggregation into amyloid fibrils or aggregation in other 
      amyloidogenic proteins. This is compatible with the inverse preferences of alanine 
      to form helices and of threonine to support beta-sheet structures, which are crucial 
      for amyloid fibrils formation. Our interest in these mutations was initiated by 
      studying the potential effects of the A539T substitution in the 
      butyrylcholinesterase BChE-K variant on amyloid fibrils formation in Alzheimer's 
      disease. Other examples are, Parkinson's disease (PD), where A53T alpha-synuclein 
      occurs in Lewy bodies and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), where an A25T 
      substitution appears in transthyretin (TTR). In peripheral organs, an A34T 
      substitution is found in the light chain immunoglobulin genes of patients with 
      systemic amyloidosis and in familial hypercholesterolemia, an A370T substitution 
      occurs in the LDLR regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. That such substitutions 
      appear in proteins with important cellular functions suggests that they confer 
      antagonistic pleiotropy, providing added value at an earlier age but causing damages 
      and inducing amyloid diseases later on. This, in turn, may explain the evolutionary 
      selection and preservation of these substitutions. The structural effect of residue 
      substitutions and in particular A to T substitutions in amyloidogenic diseases thus 
      merits further attention.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes-associated cognitive decline, the 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity is increased. 
      AChE exists as different globular molecular forms: tetramer (G4), dimer (G2) and 
      monomer (G1). In adult brain, G4 form is abundant however in AD, the ratio of lower 
      molecular forms (G1) to G4 form increased. Hence, the present study delineated the 
      inhibition of novel astaxanthin-s-allyl cysteine (AST-SAC) against BChE and various 
      molecular forms of AChE. Cobra venom, human erythrocyte and Electrophorus electricus 
      was used as source of G1, G2 and G4 form of AChE. AST-SAC showed inhibition against 
      G1 (IC(50) = 0.72 μM, competitive, Ki = 0.66 μM), G2 (IC(50) = 0.65 μM, mixed, 
      Ki = 0.50 μM) and G4 (IC(50) = 0.67 μM, competitive, Ki = 0.67 μM) form of AChE. 
      AST-SAC inhibited human brain AChE (IC(50) = 0.84 μM, competitive, Ki = 0.53 μM) and 
      human serum BChE (IC(50) = 0.80 μM, competitive, Ki = 0.58 μM). In silico analysis 
      revealed the interaction of AST-SAC with the amino acids present in peripheral 
      anionic and catalytic site of human AChE and BChE. Molecular dynamics simulation 
      confirmed the stable interaction of AST-SAC in the active site gorge of AChE and 
      BChE.

TI  - Thiol-ene click reaction-induced fluorescence enhancement by altering the radiative 
      rate for assaying butyrylcholinesterase activity.
PG  - 559-566
LID - 10.1039/c8an01808a [doi]
AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) generally acts as an important plasma biomarker for 
      clinical diagnosis due to its major contribution to human plasma cholinesterase 
      levels, but its current fluorometric assay relying on fluorogenic substrates 
      frequently suffers from the lack of sufficiently fast response time and specific 
      recognition of substrates relative to the traditional Ellman's method. In this work, 
      we report a fluorescent molecular probe for assaying BChE activity based on 
      thiol-triggered fluorescence enhancement via thiol-ene click reactions. A 
      low-temperature experiment and theoretical analysis exclude the possibility of weak 
      fluorescence of the probe caused by an intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer 
      process and support the main cause of an ultraslow radiative rate due to the 
      introduction of two acrylyl groups. This probe has sensitive fluorescence responses 
      to thiols via thiol-ene click chemistry, and it can distinguish between glutathione 
      and cysteine or homocysteine in different emission colors. The rapid reaction 
      kinetics of this probe enables it to monitor hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by 
      butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in a real-time manner. This probe is used to develop 
      the first fluorometric assay of BChE activity based on fluorescence enhancement 
      triggered by thiol-ene click chemistry using butyrylthiocholine as the substrate. 
      The established BChE assay shows excellent sensitivity, and is capable of avoiding 
      the interference from glutathione and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in a complex 
      matrix. The inhibition test of tacrine on BChE with this assay substantiates its 
      feasibility in screening potential inhibitors of BChE. This work demonstrates a 
      design strategy of fluorescent probes lighted up by thiol-ene click reactions, 
      reveals the main cause of thiol-triggered fluorescence enhancement by altering the 
      radiative rate, and provides the first fluorometric assay of BChE based on rapid 
      thiol-ene click reactions.

AB  - A new method for obtaining stable butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) samples based on the 
      enzyme immobilization in starch and gelatin gels followed by drying is proposed. 
      Coimmobilization of BuChE with the thiol group indicator 
      5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid did not reduce the activity of BuChE, which 
      allowed us to simplify the procedure and reduce the time of analysis of 
      organophosphorus pesticides. The resulting immobilized samples retained activity for 
      at least 300 days. BuChE samples based on the starch gel showed a greater 
      sensitivity in the determination of pesticides as compared to the samples based on 
      the gelatin gel.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase is a performant stoichiometric bioscavenger of 
      organophosphorous nerve agents. It is either isolated from outdated plasma or 
      functionally expressed in eukaryotic systems. Here, we report the production of 
      active human butyrylcholinesterase in a prokaryotic system after optimization of the 
      primary sequence through the Protein Repair One Stop Shop process, a structure- and 
      sequence-based algorithm for soluble bacterial expression of difficult eukaryotic 
      proteins. The mutant enzyme was purified to homogeneity. Its kinetic parameters with 
      substrate are similar to the endogenous human butyrylcholinesterase or recombinants 
      produced in eukaryotic systems. The isolated protein was prone to crystallize and 
      its 2.5-Å X-ray structure revealed an active site gorge region identical to that of 
      previously solved structures. The advantages of this alternate expression system, 
      particularly for the generation of butyrylcholinesterase variants with nerve agent 
      hydrolysis activity, are discussed.

TI  - Plasma butyrylcholinesterase regulates ghrelin to control aggression.
PG  - 2251-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1421536112 [doi]
AB  - Ongoing mouse studies of a proposed therapy for cocaine abuse based on viral gene 
      transfer of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) mutated for accelerated cocaine hydrolysis 
      have yielded surprising effects on aggression. Further investigation has linked 
      these effects to a reduction in circulating ghrelin, driven by BChE at levels ∼ 
      100-fold above normal. Tests with human BChE showed ready ghrelin hydrolysis at 
      physiologic concentrations, and multiple low-mass molecular dynamics simulations 
      revealed that ghrelin's first five residues fit sterically and electrostatically 
      into BChE's active site. Consistent with in vitro results, male BALB/c mice with 
      high plasma BChE after gene transfer exhibited sharply reduced plasma ghrelin. 
      Unexpectedly, such animals fought less, both spontaneously and in a 
      resident/intruder provocation model. One mutant BChE was found to be deficient in 
      ghrelin hydrolysis. BALB/c mice transduced with this variant retained normal plasma 
      ghrelin levels and did not differ from untreated controls in the aggression model. 
      In contrast, C57BL/6 mice with BChE gene deletion exhibited increased ghrelin and 
      fought more readily than wild-type animals. Collectively, these findings indicate 
      that BChE-catalyzed ghrelin hydrolysis influences mouse aggression and social 
      stress, with potential implications for humans.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity assay and inhibitor phenotyping can help to 
      identify individuals at risk of prolonged paralysis following the administration of 
      neuromuscular blocking agents, like succinylcholine, pesticides and nerve agents. In 
      this study, the activity of BChE and its sensitivity to inhibition by dibucaine and 
      fluoride was evaluated in 1200 Polish healthy individuals. In addition, molecular 
      analysis of all exons, exon-intron boundaries and the 3'UTR sequence of the BCHE 
      gene was performed in a group of 72 subjects with abnormal BChE activity (<2000 U/L 
      and >5745 U/L) or with DN (Dibucaine Number) or FN (Fluoride-Number) values outside 
      the reference range (DN < 78 and FN < lower than wild type). In a studied group, 
      BChE activity range was similar to those observed in other populations. BChE 
      activity screening allowed to detect UA and UF phenotypes in 26 (2.2%) and 15 (1.2%) 
      individuals, respectively. Observed UA or UF phenotypes were confirmed by direct 
      sequencing and heterozygous c.293A > G or c.1253G > T substitutions were identified 
      in all cases. Nine out of 18 (50%) individuals with BChE activity below 2000 U/L had 
      a mutation in 5'UTR (32G/A), intron 2 (c.1518-121T/C) or exon 4 (c.1699G/A; the K 
      variant mutation). Majority of the individuals with BChE activity ≥6000 U/L were 
      wild type. To summarize, the range of BChE activity in a Polish population is 
      similar to those observed in other countries. We conclude that the BChE phenotyping 
      assay is a reliable method for identification of individuals with the UA and UF 
      genotypes.

AB  - According to recent research advance, it is interesting to identify new, potent and 
      selective inhibitors of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) for therapeutic treatment 
      of both the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and heroin abuse. In this study, we carried out 
      a structure-based virtual screening followed by in vitro activity assays, with the 
      goal to identify new inhibitors that are selective for BChE over 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE). As a result, a set of new, selective inhibitors of 
      human BChE were identified from natural products with solanaceous alkaloid 
      scaffolds. The most active one of the natural products (compound 1) identified has 
      an IC(50) of 16.8 nM against BChE. It has been demonstrated that the desirable 
      selectivity of these inhibitors for BChE over AChE is mainly controlled by three key 
      residues in the active site cavity, i.e. residues Q119, A277, and A328 in BChE 
      versus the respective residues Y124, W286, and Y337 in AChE. Based on this 
      structural insight, future rational design of new, potent and selective BChE 
      inhibitors may focus on these key structural differences in the active site cavity.

TI  - Naturally Occurring Genetic Variants of Human Acetylcholinesterase and 
      Butyrylcholinesterase and Their Potential Impact on the Risk of Toxicity from 
      Cholinesterase Inhibitors.
PG  - 1381-92

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the physiologically important target for 
      organophosphorus toxicants (OP) including nerve agents and pesticides. 
      Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in blood serves as a bioscavenger that protects AChE in 
      nerve synapses from inhibition by OP. Mass spectrometry methods can detect exposure 
      to OP by measuring adducts on the active site serine of plasma BChE. Genetic 
      variants of human AChE and BChE do exist, but loss of function mutations have been 
      identified only in the BCHE gene. The most common AChE variant, His353Asn (H322N), 
      also known as the Yt blood group antigen, has normal AChE activity. The most common 
      BChE variant, Ala567Thr (A539T) or the K-variant in honor of Werner Kalow, has 33% 
      reduced plasma BChE activity. The genetic variant most frequently associated with 
      prolonged response to muscle relaxants, Asp98Gly (D70G) or atypical BChE, has 
      reduced activity and reduced enzyme concentration. Early studies in young, healthy 
      males, performed at a time when it was legal to test nerve agents in humans, showed 
      that individuals responded differently to the same low dose of sarin with toxic 
      symptoms ranging in severity from minimal to moderate. Additionally, animal studies 
      indicated that BChE protects from toxicants that have a higher reactivity with AChE 
      than with BChE (e.g., nerve agents) but not from toxicants that have a higher 
      reactivity with BChE than with AChE (e.g., OP pesticides). As a corollary, we 
      hypothesize that individuals with genetic variants of BChE may be at increased risk 
      of toxicity from nerve agents but not from OP pesticides.

AB  - Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus fungi and found in 
      contaminated milk, breastfeed and dairy products, being highly toxic and 
      carcinogenic to humans and other mammalian species. It is also produced in the human 
      body as a metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), one of the most toxic natural products 
      known. Previous studies have shown that AFM1 is a potential inhibitor of the enzyme 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and therefore, a potential neurotoxic agent. In this 
      work, surface screening (SS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on human 
      acetylcholinesterase AChE (HssAChE) were performed to corroborate literature data 
      regarding preferential binding sites and type of inhibition. Also, an inedited 
      theoretical study on the interactions of AFM1 with human butyrylcholinesterase 
      (HssBChE) was performed. In vitro inhibition tests on both enzymes were done to 
      support theoretical results. MD simulations suggested the catalytic anionic site of 
      HssAChE as the preferential binding site for AFM1 and also that this metabolite is 
      not a good inhibitor of HssBChE, corroborating previous studies. In vitro assays 
      also corroborated molecular modeling studies by showing that AFM1 did not inhibit 
      BChE and was able to inhibit AChE, although not as much as AFB1.

LID - 800
AB  - Thirteen known (1-12 and 16) and three previously undescribed Amaryllidaceae 
      alkaloids of belladine structural type, named carltonine A-C (13-15), were isolated 
      from bulbs of Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton (Amaryllidaceae) by standard 
      chromatographic methods. Compounds isolated in sufficient amounts, and not tested 
      previously, were evaluated for their in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE; E.C. 
      3.1.1.7), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; E.C. 3.1.1.8) and prolyl oligopeptidase 
      (POP; E.C. 3.4.21.26) inhibition activities. Significant human BuChE (hBUChE) 
      inhibitory activity was demonstrated by newly described alkaloids carltonine A (13) 
      and carltonine B (14) with IC(50) values of 913 ± 20 nM and 31 ± 1 nM, respectively. 
      Both compounds displayed a selective inhibition pattern for hBuChE with an 
      outstanding selectivity profile over AChE inhibition, higher than 100. The in vitro 
      data were further supported by in silico studies of the active alkaloids 13 and 14 
      in the active site of hBuChE.

TI  - Cryo-EM structure of the native butyrylcholinesterase tetramer reveals a dimer of 
      dimers stabilized by a superhelical assembly.
PG  - 13270-13275
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1817009115 [doi]
AB  - The quaternary structures of the cholinesterases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
      butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), are essential for their localization and function. Of 
      practical importance, BChE is a promising therapeutic candidate for intoxication by 
      organophosphate nerve agents and insecticides, and for detoxification of addictive 
      substances. Efficacy of the recombinant enzyme hinges on its having a long 
      circulatory half-life; this, in turn, depends strongly on its ability to 
      tetramerize. Here, we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the 
      structure of the highly glycosylated native BChE tetramer purified from human plasma 
      at 5.7 Å. Our structure reveals that the BChE tetramer is organized as a staggered 
      dimer of dimers. Tetramerization is mediated by assembly of the C-terminal 
      tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization (WAT) helices from each subunit as a 
      superhelical assembly around a central lamellipodin-derived oligopeptide with a 
      proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) sequence that adopts a polyproline II helical 
      conformation and runs antiparallel. The catalytic domains within a dimer are 
      asymmetrically linked to the WAT/PRAD. In the resulting arrangement, the 
      tetramerization domain is largely shielded by the catalytic domains, which may 
      contribute to the stability of the human BChE (HuBChE) tetramer. Our cryo-EM 
      structure reveals the basis for assembly of the native tetramers and has 
      implications for the therapeutic applications of HuBChE. This mode of 
      tetramerization is seen only in the cholinesterases but may provide a promising 
      template for designing other proteins with improved circulatory residence times.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is the most promising bioscavenger candidate to treat 
      or prevent organophosphate (OP) poisoning. However, the clinical application of BChE 
      is limited by two obstacles: an inadequate circulation half-life and limited sources 
      for production. Although several modification technologies including glycosylation 
      and PEGylation have been developed to improve its pharmacokinetics, none of them 
      have been able to outperform blood-derived native BChE. In this work, we designed a 
      long-circulating bioscavenger nanogel by coating equine serum-derived BChE with a 
      zwitterionic polymer gel layer. This zwitterionic gel coating protected BChE from 
      denaturation and degradation under harsh conditions. Notably, the nanocapsule 
      exhibited a long circulation half-life of ~45h, a three-fold increase from the 
      unmodified native version, enabling both therapeutic and prophylactic applications. 
      In addition, the gel coating reduced the immunogenicity of equine BChE, unlocking 
      the possibility to use non-human derived BChE as an OP bioscavenger in humans.

AB  - Recombinant butyrylcholinesterase produced in a metabolically regulated transgenic 
      rice cell culture (rrBChE) was purified to produce a highly pure (95%), active form 
      of enzyme. The developed downstream process uses common manufacturing friendly 
      operations including tangential flow filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, and 
      affinity chromatography to obtain a process recovery of 42% active rrBChE. The 
      purified rrBChE was then characterized to confirm its comparability to the native 
      human form of the molecule (hBChE). The recombinant and native enzyme demonstrated 
      comparable enzymatic behavior and had an identical amino acid sequence. However, 
      rrBChE differs in that it contains plant-type complex N-glycans, including an α-1,3 
      linked core fucose, and a β-1,2 xylose, and lacking a terminal sialic acid. Despite 
      this difference, rrBChE is demonstrated to be an effective stoichiometric 
      bioscavenger for five different organophosphorous nerve agents in vitro. Together, 
      the efficient downstream processing scheme and functionality of rrBChE confirm its 
      promise as a cost-effective alternative to hBChE for prophylactic and therapeutic 
      use.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an enzyme that has been investigated for its 
      putative role in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of our 
      work was to study BChE activity variations in schizophrenic patients and to 
      investigate the involvement of this enzyme in schizophrenia and the importance of 
      determining its activity in this disease. This cross-sectional study was carried out 
      131 (104 males and 27 females, mean age  = 38.0  ±  11.4 years) patients with 
      chronic schizophrenia according DSM-IV criteria and 90 (64 males and 26 females, 
      mean age  = 37.1  ±  15.9 years) healthy controls. Plasma BChE activity was 
      determined by a kinetic method on Integra 400plus(TM) (Roche Diagnostics). Patients 
      with schizophrenia had higher plasma BChE activity than controls (P < 0.0001). 
      Female patients had higher BChE activity and smokers had lower BChE activity than 
      non-smokers either in patients and controls. In patients with schizophrenia, BChE 
      activity was not differed with age, alcohol status and clinical sub-types, and was 
      not correlated to duration of illness. Concerning therapeutic features, BChE 
      activity was higher in patients treated with antipsychotics monotherapy than those 
      treated with an association of antipsychotic and anticholinergic drugs, without 
      significant difference (P  = 0.196). Schizophrenic patients showed an increase BChE 
      activity, which could be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of the butyrylcholinesterase K variant (BChE-K) 
      and the plasma BChE activity with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Thai 
      community-dwelling patients. METHODS: One hundred patients diagnosed with MCI and 
      100 control subjects were recruited from the community-dwelling setting in Bangkok, 
      Thailand. The genotype and allele distributions of the BChE-K were determined by 
      polymerase chain reaction and subsequent DNA sequencing. The BChE activity was 
      measured in plasma according to the Ellman's method. RESULTS: The BChE-K allele 
      frequencies in the Thai community-dwelling patients were in accordance with other 
      ethnics. The BChE-K allele frequency in the control subjects (12%) was higher than 
      that of MCI patients (5.5%), suggesting a protective role of BChE-K for MCI in the 
      Thai community-dwelling patients. The BChE-K homozygotes were significantly 
      associated with lower BChE activity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the 
      BChE-K may be implicated as a protective factor for MCI in the Thai 
      community-dwelling patients, although a further study with a large sample size is 
      warranted to confirm this.

TI  - In Situ Generation of Prussian Blue by MIL-53 (Fe) for Point-of-Care Testing of 
      Butyrylcholinesterase Activity Using a Portable High-Throughput Photothermal Device.
PG  - 14806-14813
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03575 [doi]
AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), the primary source of serum cholinesterase activity, 
      is an indispensable biochemical marker for clinical diagnosis of liver function and 
      organophosphorus poisoning. The requirement for bulky and expensive instruments 
      represents a huge hindrance for point-of-care testing (POCT) of BuChE, especially in 
      resource-limited settings. Herein, an easy-operated, economic, and portable 
      photothermal (PT) biosensing platform for high-throughput BuChE detection was 
      rationally designed. BuChE could "light up" the PT signal through in situ generation 
      of Prussian blue (PB) by MIL-53 (Fe), which allowed us to translate biological 
      signals into temperature signals. Such temperature change signals could be monitored 
      at high throughput (six samples for a single measurement) by a miniature self-made 
      integrated PT device via combining separable 96-well plates, a three-dimensional 
      (3D) printed sample bracket, 808 nm lasers, and thermometers, satisfying the 
      requirement for rapid on-site detection in a large batch with low cost. In addition, 
      the large specific surface area, 3D network structure, and high porosity of MIL-53 
      (Fe) offered a beneficial platform for its reaction with enzymatic hydrolysate, 
      resulting in high sensing sensitivity and low detection limit (0.3 U L(-1)), which 
      was at least 20 000 times lower than the normal human serum BuChE activity. This 
      facile, affordable, and broad applicability PT sensing platform provides a 
      beneficial reference for the rational design of other disease diagnostic approaches 
      suitable for POCT.

TI  - Computational and experimental studies on the interaction between 
      butyrylcholinesterase and fluoxetine: implications in health and disease.
PG  - 803-810

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a serine esterase that plays a role in the 
      detoxification of natural as well as synthetic ester-bond-containing compounds. 
      Alterations in BChE activity are associated with a number of diseases. Cholinergic 
      system abnormalities in particular are correlated with the formation of senile 
      plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and administration of cholinesterase inhibitors 
      is a common therapeutic approach used to treat AD. Here, our aim was to study the 
      interaction between BChE and fluoxetine. Molecular docking simulations revealed that 
      fluoxetine penetrated deep into the active-site gorge of BChE and that it was 
      engaged in stabilizing noncovalent interactions with multiple subsites. In substrate 
      kinetic studies, the V(m), K(m), k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) values were found to be 
      20.59 ± 0.36 U mg(-1) protein, 194 ± 14 µM, 1.3 × 10(8) s(-1) and 
      6.7 × 10(5) µM(-1)s(-1), respectively. Based on inhibitory studies, fluoxetine 
      appeared to inhibit BChE competitively, with an IC(50) value of 104 µM and a K(i) 
      value of 36.3 ± 4.7 µM. Overall, both the low K(i) value and the high number of 
      BChE-fluoxetine interactions suggest that fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of BChE, 
      although in vivo mechanisms for the direct effects of BChE inhibition on various 
      pathologies remain to be further investigated.

AB  - The efficiency of different reactivators of cholinesterase (toxogonin, dipiroxime, 
      pralidoxime, carboxim, HI-6, and methoxime) at inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase 
      and human acetylcholinesterase by organophosphate insecticide malathion was 
      evaluated in in vitro experiments. Most reactivators increased inhibition of 
      butyrylcholinesterase in comparison with the control, but HI-6 in a concentration of 
      10(-3) mol/liter partially (10%) restored activity of the enzyme. Oxime-induced 
      reactivation of acetylcholinesterase was most pronounced in dipyroxime and 
      toxogonin: parameters of the kinetics of reduction of the phosphorylated enzyme 
      differed by more than 2 times from the values received with the use of other 
      reactivators.

AB  - The administration of purified human plasma-derived butyrylcholinesterase (HuBuChE) 
      as a pretreatment has been demonstrated to enhance survival and protect against 
      decreased cognitive function after exposure to organophosphorus poisons (OPs). Based 
      on efficacy data obtained with guinea pigs and non-human primates and the lack of 
      behavioral side effects, plasma-derived HuBuChE has been granted investigational new 
      drug status by the US Food and Drug Administration. The recent availability of a 
      recombinant form of HuBuChE (rHuBuChE) from the milk of transgenic goats has now 
      allowed us to determine the pharmacokinetics of that material in guinea pigs and use 
      it as a therapy following exposure to the VX. The rHuBuChE was expressed as a dimer 
      and following intramuscular (i.m.) administration had more a rapid adsorption and 
      clearance profile in guinea pigs than the plasma-derived material. Based on those 
      data, we administered rHuBuChE i.m. 1h after a percutaneous exposure of guinea pigs 
      to either 2xLD(50) or 5xLD(50) of VX. Post-exposure therapy with rHuBuChE provided 
      improved survival at both challenge levels, 90% and 33% respectively versus 20% or 
      0% respectively for animals that did not receive therapy. These studies showed that 
      BuChE can be efficacious as a therapy against percutaneous exposure to VX.

AB  - The study presents the discovery of novel butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors 
      among derivatives of azaphenothiazines by application of in silico and in vitro 
      screening methods. From an in-house library of compounds, 143 heterocyclic molecules 
      derived from the azaphenothiazine scaffold were chosen for virtual screening. Based 
      on results of the docking procedure, 15 compounds were identified as exhibiting the 
      best fit for the two screening complexes (ligand - AChE and ligand - BuChE). Five 
      compounds displayed moderate AChE and good BuChE inhibitory activity at screening 
      concentrations of 10 µM. The IC50 values for active BuChE inhibitors were in the 
      11.8-122.2 nM range. Three of the most active inhibitors are tetra- or pentacyclic 
      derivatives of azaphenothiazines with the same N-methyl-2-piperidinethyl 
      substituent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a severe neurodegenerative disease of the central 
      nervous system in the elderly. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: In our study, we aimed to find 
      the best potential small molecule for AD treatment. STUDY DESIGN: We used many 
      models in Discovery Studio 2016 to find new potential inhibitors of 
      butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), including pharmacophore model, virtual screening 
      model, molecular docking model, de novo evolution model. METHODS: Ligand-based 
      pharmacophore models were used to identify the critical chemical features of BChE 
      inhibitors using the module of 3D QSAR Pharmacophore Generation in Discovery Studio 
      2016. The best pharmacophore model was then validated by cost analysis, Fischer's 
      randomization method, 3D-QSAR Method of the training set and test set. The compounds 
      that match the best pharmacophore model with the predicted activity <1 μM filtered 
      by Lipinski's rule of five were subjected to molecular docking. RESULT: After 
      virtual screening, 35 compounds filtered by Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET 
      analysis were subjected to molecular docking and then the number were narrowed down 
      on 10 compounds based on -CDOCKER_ENERGY. Finally, we obtained and modified the best 
      potential candidate ENA739155. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, ENA739155_Evo with 
      -CDOCKER_ENERGY of 47.12, estimate activity of 0.012, fit value of 10.02 could be 
      further subjected to drug development and forwarded as better alternatives to the 
      current batch of medicines used for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Increased serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity is a feature of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) in humans and rats. The objective of this study was to evaluate serum 
      BChE activity in diabetic dogs. The activity of the enzyme was assessed in three 
      cohorts of animals: (1) dogs with naturally occurring DM (n=74); (2) clinically 
      normal dogs (n=74); and (3) dogs with various other diseases (n=74). A statistically 
      significant increase in BChE activity was found in the diabetic dogs (7.59 ± 2.9 
      kUI/L) compared with the clinically normal animals (6.12 ± 1.94 kUI/L; P<0.05), and 
      with the dogs with other diseases (5.55 ± 2.06 kUI/L; P<0.01). Such increased 
      activity could be the result of the altered glucose and lipid metabolism that occurs 
      in DM.

AB  - We previously reported that recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (rhBChE) 
      complexed with a series of copolymers of poly-l-lysine (PLL) with grafted 
      (polyethylene) glycol (PEG) (i.e., PLL-g-PEG) showed reduced catalytic activity but 
      relatively similar concentration-dependent inactivation of the organophosphorus 
      inhibitor paraoxon. Herein, we compared the kinetics of catalysis (using 
      butyrylthiocholine as the substrate) and inhibition (using four different 
      inhibitors) of free and copolymer-complexed rhBChE. Using scanning electron 
      microscopy, polyionic complexes of rhBChE with three different PLL-g-PEG copolymers 
      (based on PLL size) appeared as spheroid-shaped particles with relatively similar 
      particle sizes (median diameter = 35 nm). Relatively similar particle sizes were 
      also noted using dynamic light scattering (mean = 26-35 nm). The three 
      copolymer-complexed enzymes exhibited reduced k(cat) (30-33% reduction), but no 
      significant changes in K(m). Inhibitory potency (as reflected by the bimolecular 
      rate constant, k(i)) was similar among the free and copolymer-complexed enzymes when 
      paraoxon was the inhibitor, whereas statistically significant reductions in k(i) 
      (16-60%) were noted with the other inhibitors. Sensitivity to inactivation by 
      proteases and heat was also compared. Copolymer-complexed enzymes showed lesser 
      time-dependent inactivation by the proteases trypsin and pronase and by heat 
      compared to the free enzyme. Understanding the unique properties of PLL-g-PEG-BChE 
      complexes may lead to enhanced approaches for use of BChE and other protein 
      bioscavengers.

PG  - 348-54
LID - 10.1039/c3mb70313d [doi]
AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and its mutants have shown great potential in 
      treating cocaine overdose and addiction. In order to effectively suppress cocaine 
      reward in the brain for a long period of time after an exogenous cocaine hydrolase 
      administration, the therapeutic enzyme should have not only a high catalytic 
      efficiency against cocaine, but also a sufficiently long circulation time. It has 
      been known that PEGylation (covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol) modification 
      of a therapeutic protein can prolong the biological half-life of the protein without 
      affecting its biological function. However, the asparagine-linked glycans on the 
      surface of glycosylated BChE may interfere with the PEGylation modification. In this 
      study, we built a three-dimensional (3D) model of glycosylated human BChE to 
      investigate the influence of glycans on the PEGylation modification. Glycans did not 
      change the overall stability of the BChE structure, but could increase the 
      flexibility of some local structures. For further evaluating the accessibility of 
      the PEGylation reaction sites, particularly lysine residues, on the protein surface, 
      we calculated the Solvent Accessible Surface Areas (SASAs) of these residues. The 
      results indicate that some lysine residues show a significant decrease in SASA due 
      to the direct or indirect influence of their surrounding glycans. The results also 
      indicate that PEGylation reaction agents with smaller functional groups could have a 
      better chance to react with lysine residues. This investigation provides a 
      structural basis for rational engineering of human BChE and its mutants as 
      therapeutic candidates.

TI  - Evaluation of the inhibitory effect of abamectin on mammalian butyrylcholinesterase: 
      Enzyme kinetic and molecular docking studies.
PG  - 713-718

AB  - Abamectin, a blend of the natural avermectins B(1a) and B(1b), is a widely-used 
      insecticide/miticide with relatively low toxicity to mammals. Exposure to high doses 
      of it, however, leads to cholinergic-like neurotoxic effects. Butyrylcholinesterase, 
      which is best known for its abundant presence in plasma, is a serine hydrolase 
      loosely coupled with the cholinergic system. It protects and supports the 
      neurotransmitter function of its sister enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Here, using 
      experimental and computational studies, we provide evidence demonstrating that 
      abamectin is a potent (IC(50) = 10.6 μM; K(i) = 2.26 ± 0.35 μM) inhibitor of horse 
      serum butyrylcholinesterase and that it interacts with the enzyme in a reversible, 
      competitive manner predictively to block the mouth of the active-site gorge of the 
      enzyme and to bind to several critical residues that normally bind/hydrolyze choline 
      esters.

AB  - Recently, the use of atomic spectrometry (AS) for biochemical analysis has attracted 
      considerable attention due to its high sensitivity, selectivity and 
      anti-interference ability. In this work, we conducted a detailed study on a 
      phenomenon of thiol inhibition of mercury (Hg(2+)) cold vapor generation (CVG) and 
      found (L)-cysteine ((L)-Cys), glutathione (GSH), dithiothreitol, 
      N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, β-mercaptoethanol, and NaI can 
      inhibit the CVG of Hg(2+), while EDTA has no inhibitory effect. Furthermore, 
      changing the content of -SH can effectively adjust the CVG atomic fluorescence 
      spectrometer (CVG-AFS) signal of Hg(2+). As as a consequence, an AS-based 
      homogeneous bioassay was constructed by adjusting the oxidation ratio and production 
      quantity of -SH in the system. The quantitative analysis of the system was 
      demonstrated by using AFS as a representative detector. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) 
      and glucose were used as representative analytes for the validation of Hg(2+) atomic 
      fluorescence signal turn-off strategy, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) as well as 
      parathion (organophosphorus pesticides, OPs) as utilized as representative targets 
      for the signal turn-on strategy. Under optimal experimental conditions, the 
      homogeneous CVG-AFS sensor can be successfully used to detect 3 μM H(2)O(2), 30 μM 
      glucose, 0.25 U/L BChE, and 0.4 μg/mL parathion. In addition, the detection results 
      of glucose and BChE in human serum samples agreed well with those obtained by using 
      glucometer and kit, showing the promising potential of this method for practical 
      applications. Therefore, this work provides a perspective for the construction of 
      AS-based homogeneous bioassays and shows great potential for the detection of 
      biomarkers.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is routinely measured to assess exposure to or effects 
      of organophosphorus insecticides (OP). As a biomarker, it can be used to clarify the 
      relation between exposure to OP and health impairment. The interpretation of BuChE 
      inhibition data, particularly of small changes in enzymatic activity, sometimes 
      presents significant complexities. These complexities are presented in this short 
      communication and the factors that influence the degree of BuChE inhibition are 
      discussed. Despite the complexities of their interpretation, BuChE measurements 
      remain a mainstay for the fast initial screening of exposure to OP; thus, they are a 
      useful tool in the protection of humans, domestic animals and wildlife from 
      overexposure to these toxic agents.

TI  - Inhibition of Butyrylcholinesterase with Fluorobenzylcymserine, An Experimental 
      Alzheimer's Drug Candidate: Validation of Enzoinformatics Results by Classical and 
      Innovative Enzyme Kinetic Analyses.
PG  - 820-827
LID - 10.2174/1871527316666170207160606 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selective butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)-inhibition, increases 
      acetylcholine (ACh) levels. In rodents, this inhibition is known to boost cognition. 
      Also, this occurs without the typical unwanted adverse effects of 
      acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors or AChE-Is. The novel compound, 
      fluorobenzylcymserine (FBC), is derived from our effort to design a selective 
      BuChE-inhibitor. Also, we wanted to check whether butyrylcholinesterase-inhibitors 
      (BuChE-Is) possessed an edge over AChE-Is in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in terms of 
      efficacy and/or tolerance. METHOD: FBC was synthesized as reported earlier while 
      enzymatic activity of BuChE was calculated by Ellman-technique. Molecular docking 
      was performed using Autodock4.2. We applied classical as well as innovative analyses 
      of enzyme-kinetics for exploring "FBC:human BuChE-interaction". The mode of 
      inhibition and kinetic parameters were also determined. RESULTS: Docking results 
      displayed two strong interacting sites for FBC. One of these binding sites was 
      previously identified as a deep narrow groove having polar aromatic residues while a 
      second site was identified during this study which displayed better interaction and 
      was lined with aliphatic and sulphur containing residues. At low concentrations of 
      BuChE, the IC50 was found to be very low i.e. 4.79 and 6.10 nM for 12 and 36 µg, 
      respectively, whereas it increased exponentially by increasing the units of BuChE. 
      CONCLUSION: These analyses indicate that FBC is an interesting AD drug candidate 
      that could provide a potent and partial mixed type of inhibition of human BuChE.

AB  - Human plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an endogenous bioscavenger that 
      hydrolyzes numerous medicamentous and poisonous esters and scavenges potent 
      organophosphorus nerve agents. BChE is thus a marker for the diagnosis of OP 
      poisoning. It is also considered a therapeutic target against Alzheimer's disease. 
      Although the X-ray structure of a partially deglycosylated monomer of human BChE was 
      solved 15 years ago, all attempts to determine the 3D structure of the natural 
      full-length glycosylated tetrameric human BChE have been unsuccessful so far. Here, 
      a combination of three complementary structural methods-single-particle 
      cryo-electron microscopy, molecular dynamics and small-angle X-ray scattering-were 
      implemented to elucidate the overall structural and spatial organization of the 
      natural tetrameric human plasma BChE. A 7.6 Å cryoEM map clearly shows the major 
      features of the enzyme: a dimer of dimers with a nonplanar monomer arrangement, in 
      which the interconnecting super helix complex PRAD-(WAT)(4)-peptide C-terminal tail 
      is located in the center of the tetramer, nearly perpendicular to its plane, and is 
      plunged deep between the four subunits. Molecular dynamics simulations allowed 
      optimization of the geometry of the molecule and reconstruction of the structural 
      features invisible in the cryoEM density, i.e., glycan chains and glycan interdimer 
      contact areas, as well as intermonomer disulfide bridges at the C-terminal tail. 
      Finally, SAXS data were used to confirm the consistency of the obtained model with 
      the experimental data. The tetramer organization of BChE is unique in that the four 
      subunits are joined at their C-termini through noncovalent contacts with a short 
      polyproline-rich peptide. This tetramer structure could serve as a model for the 
      design of highly stable glycosylated tetramers.

TI  - Butyrylcholinesterase Deficiency Promotes Adipose Tissue Growth and Hepatic Lipid

PG  - 3086-95
LID - 10.1210/en.2016-1166 [doi]
AB  - Despite numerous reports of relationships between weight gain and 
      butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), this enzyme's role in the genesis of obesity remains 
      unclear, but recent research points to strong links with ghrelin, the "hunger 
      hormone." The availability of BChE knockout (KO) mice provides an opportunity to 
      clarify the causal relationship between BChE and obesity onset. We now find that 
      young KO mice have abnormally high plasma ghrelin levels that slowly decline during 
      long-term high-fat feeding and ultimately drop below those in wild-type mice. On 
      such a diet, the KO mice gained notably more weight, more white fat, and more 
      hepatic fat than wild-type animals. In addition to a greater burden of hepatic 
      triglycerides, the livers of these KO mice show distinctly higher levels of 
      inflammatory markers. Finally, their energy expenditure proved to be lower than in 
      wild-type mice despite similar activity levels and increased caloric intake. A gene 
      transfer of mouse BChE with adeno-associated virus vector restored nearly all 
      aspects of the normal phenotype. Our results indicate that BChE strongly affects fat 
      metabolism, has an important impact on fat accumulation, and may be a promising tool 
      for combating obesity.

TI  - Rat butyrylcholinesterase-catalysed hydrolysis of N-alkyl homologues of 
      benzoylcholine.
PG  - 1185-97
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the catalytic properties of rat 
      butyrylcholinesterase with benzoylcholine (BzCh) and N-alkyl derivatives of BzCh 
      (BCHn) as substrates. Complex hysteretic behaviour was observed in the approach to 
      steady-state kinetics for each ester. Hysteresis consisted of a long lag phase with 
      damped oscillation. The presence of a long lag phase, with no oscillations, in 
      substrate hydrolysis by rat butyrylcholinesterase was also observed with 
      N-methylindoxyl acetate as substrate. Hysteretic behaviour was explained by the 
      existence of two interconvertible butyrylcholinesterase forms in slow equilibrium, 
      while just one of them is catalytically active. The damped oscillations were 
      explained by the existence of different substrate conformational states and/or 
      aggregates (micelles) in slow equilibrium. Different substrate conformational states 
      were confirmed by 1H-NMR. The K(m) values for substrates decreased as the length of 
      the alkyl chain increased. High affinity of the enzyme for the longest alkyl chain 
      length substrates was explained by multiple hydrophobic interactions of the alkyl 
      chain with amino acid residues lining the active site gorge. Molecular modelling 
      studies supported this interpretation; docking energy decreased as the length of the 
      alkyl chain increased. The long-chain substrates had reduced k(cat) values. Docking 
      studies showed that long-chain substrates were not optimally oriented in the active 
      site for catalysis, thus explaining the slow rate of hydrolysis. The hydrolytic rate 
      of BCH12 and longer alkyl chain esters vs. substrate concentration showed a 
      premature plateau far below V(max). This was due to the loss of substrate 
      availability. The best substrates for rat butyrylcholinesterase were short alkyl 
      homologues, BzCh - BCH4.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an enzyme with broad substrate and ligand 
      specificities and may function as a generalized bioscavenger by binding and/or 
      hydrolyzing various xenobiotic agents and toxicants, many of which target the 
      central and peripheral nervous systems. Variants of BChE were rationally designed to 
      increase the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze the psychoactive enantiomer of cocaine. 
      These variants were cloned, and then expressed using the magnICON transient 
      expression system in plants and their enzymatic properties were investigated. In 
      particular, we explored the effects that these site-directed mutations have over the 
      enzyme kinetics with various substrates of BChE. We further compared the affinity of 
      various anticholinesterases including organophosphorous nerve agents and pesticides 
      toward these BChE variants relative to the wild type enzyme. In addition to serving 
      as a therapy for cocaine addiction-related diseases, enhanced bioscavenging against 
      other harmful agents could add to the practicality and versatility of the 
      plant-derived recombinant enzyme as a multivalent therapeutic.

TI  - The C5 Variant of the Butyrylcholinesterase Tetramer Includes a Noncovalently Bound 
      60 kDa Lamellipodin Fragment.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22071083 [doi]
LID - 1083
AB  - Humans with the C5 genetic variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) have 30-200% 
      higher plasma BChE activity, low body weight, and shorter duration of action of the 
      muscle relaxant succinylcholine. The C5 variant has an extra, slow-moving band of 
      BChE activity on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This band is about 60 
      kDa larger than wild-type BChE. Umbilical cord BChE in 100% of newborn babies has a 
      C5-like band. Our goal was to identify the unknown, 60 kDa protein in C5. Both 
      wild-type and C5 BChE are under the genetic control of two independent loci, the 
      BCHE gene on Chr 3q26.1 and the RAPH1 (lamellipodin) gene on Chr 2q33. Wild-type 
      BChE tetramers are assembled around a 3 kDa polyproline peptide from lamellipodin. 
      Western blot of boiled C5 and cord BChE showed a positive response with an antibody 
      to the C-terminus of lamellipodin. The C-terminal exon of lamellipodin is about 60 
      kDa including an N-terminal polyproline. We propose that the unknown protein in C5 
      and cord BChE is encoded by the last exon of the RAPH1 gene. In 90% of the 
      population, the 60 kDa fragment is shortened to 3 kDa during maturation to 
      adulthood, leaving only 10% of adults with C5 BChE.

TI  - Comparison of Efficiency of Purification (from Human Plasma) of a Nerve Agent Adduct 
      of Butyrylcholinesterase Between the Affinity Gel Method and Immunomagnetic 
      Separation.
PG  - 248-253
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmx107 [doi]
AB  - O-ethyl S-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methyl phosphonothiolate (VX) is a highly toxic 
      chemical warfare agent because it inhibits cholinesterase (ChE) activity in the 
      nervous system. Inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity by VX is due to 
      formation of a phosphorylated BChE adduct; this adduct in human plasma can serve as 
      a biomarker of exposure to nerve agents. We compared purification efficiency between 
      the procainamide affinity gel method and immunomagnetic separation (IMS) for the 
      nerve agent adduct of BChE in plasma and then optimized the sample preparation by 
      purifying BChE to measure biomarkers of human exposure to organophosphorus nerve 
      agents. The purification efficiency of IMS was 5-fold greater than that of the 
      procainamide affinity gel method because the antibody conjugate with protein G 
      magnetic beads ensured highly selective capture and high recovery of VX-inhibited 
      BChE from plasma. Protein isolation and extraction of the adduct of VX-inhibited 
      BChE from plasma were made more specific by IMS. A 50 µL of the IMS solution was 
      enough to bind VX-inhibited BChE in up to 0.5 mL of plasma. Nonetheless, the IMS 
      method has a limitation in terms of reutilization of the complexes antibody-magnetic 
      beads. We expect that this approach can be used to quantify other types of 
      organophosphorus adducts in human plasma, thus serving as a possible general assay 
      for biomarkers of exposure to nerve agents.

AB  - Ligand and structure-based pharmacophore models were used to identify the important 
      chemical features of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors. A training set of 16 
      known structurally diverse compounds with a wide range of inhibitory activity 
      against BChE was used to develop a quantitative ligand-based pharmacophore (Hypo1) 
      model to identify novel BChE inhibitors in virtual screening databases. A 
      structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis (Phar1) was also developed with the 
      ligand-binding site of BChE in consideration. Further, the models were validated 
      using test set, Fisher's Randomization and Leave-one-out validation methods. 
      Well-validated pharmacophore hypotheses were further used as 3D queries in virtual 
      screening and 430 compounds were finally selected for molecular docking analysis. 
      Subsequently, ADMET, DFT and chemical similarity search were employed to narrow down 
      on seven compounds as potential drug candidates. Analogues of the best hit were 
      further developed through a bioisosterism-guided approach to further generate a 
      library of potential BChE inhibitors.

AB  - Extensive computational modeling and simulations have been carried out, in the 
      present study, to uncover the fundamental reaction pathway for butyrylcholinesterase 
      (BChE)-catalyzed hydrolysis of ghrelin, demonstrating that the acylation process of 
      BChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of ghrelin follows an unprecedented single-step reaction 
      pathway and the single-step acylation process is rate-determining. The free energy 
      barrier (18.8 kcal/mol) calculated for the rate-determining step is reasonably close 
      to the experimentally-derived free energy barrier (~19.4 kcal/mol), suggesting that 
      the obtained mechanistic insights are reasonable. The single-step reaction pathway 
      for the acylation is remarkably different from the well-known two-step acylation 
      reaction pathway for numerous ester hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by a serine 
      esterase. This is the first time demonstrating that a single-step reaction pathway 
      is possible for an ester hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by a serine esterase and, 
      therefore, one no longer can simply assume that the acylation process must follow 
      the well-known two-step reaction pathway.

AB  - Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a glycoprotein capable of bioscavenging toxic 
      compounds such as organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents. For commercial production of 
      BChE, it is practical to synthesize BChE in non-human expression systems, such as 
      plants or animals. However, the glycosylation profile in these systems is 
      significantly different from the human glycosylation profile, which could result in 
      changes in BChE's structure and function. From our investigation, we found that the 
      glycan attached to ASN241 is both structurally and functionally important due to its 
      close proximity to the BChE tetramerization domain and the active site gorge. To 
      investigate the effects of populating glycosylation site ASN241, monomeric human 
      BChE glycoforms were simulated with and without site ASN241 glycosylated. Our 
      simulations indicate that the structure and function of human BChE are significantly 
      affected by the absence of glycan 241.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a serine hydrolase that is present in all mammalian 
      tissues. It can accommodate larger substrates or inhibitors than 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of the 
      neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central nervous system and neuromuscular 
      junctions. AChE is the specific target of organophosphorous pesticides and warfare 
      nerve agents, and BChE is a stoichiometric bioscavenger. Conversion of BChE into a 
      catalytic bioscavenger by rational design or designing reactivators specific to BChE 
      required structural data obtained using a recombinant low-glycosylated human BChE 
      expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This expression system yields ≈ 1 mg of 
      pure enzyme per litre of cell culture. Here, we report an improved expression system 
      using insect cells with a fourfold higher yield for truncated human BChE with all 
      glycosylation sites present. We developed a fast purification protocol for the 
      recombinant protein using huprine-based affinity chromatography, which is superior 
      to the classical procainamide-based affinity. The purified BChE crystallized under 
      different conditions and space group than the recombinant low-glycosylated protein 
      produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The crystals diffracted to 2.5 Å. The 
      overall monomer structure is similar to the low-glycosylated structure except for 
      the presence of the additional glycans. Remarkably, the carboxylic acid molecule 
      systematically bound to the catalytic serine in the low-glycosylated structure is 
      also present in this new structure, despite the different expression system, 
      purification protocol and crystallization conditions.

TI  - High-Confidence Qualitative Identification of Organophosphorus Nerve Agent Adducts 
      to Human Butyrylcholinesterase.
PG  - 1955-1964
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04441 [doi]
AB  - In this study, a data-dependent, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry 
      (ddHRMS/MS) method capable of detecting all organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) 
      adducts to human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was developed. After an exposure 
      event, immunoprecipitation from blood with a BChE-specific antibody and digestion 
      with pepsin produces a nine amino acid peptide containing the OPNA adduct. Signature 
      product ions of this peptic BChE nonapeptide (FGES*AGAAS) offer a route to broadly 
      screen for OPNA exposure. Taking this approach on an HRMS instrument identifies 
      biomarkers, including unknowns, with high mass accuracy. Using a set of pooled human 
      sera exposed to OPNAs as quality control (QC) materials, the developed method 
      successfully identified precursor ions with <1 ppm and tied them to signature 
      product ions with <5 ppm deviation from their chemical formulas. This high mass 
      accuracy data from precursor and product ions, collected over 23 independent 
      immunoprecipitation preparations, established method operating limits. QC data and 
      experiments with 14 synthetic reference peptides indicated that reliable qualitative 
      identification of biomarkers was possible for analytes >15 ng/mL. The developed 
      method was applied to a convenience set of 96 unexposed serum samples and a blinded 
      set of 80 samples treated with OPNAs. OPNA biomarkers were not observed in 
      convenience set samples and no false positive or negative identifications were 
      observed in blinded samples. All biomarkers in the blinded serum set >15 ng/mL were 
      correctly identified. For the first time, this study reports a ddHRMS/MS method 
      capable of complementing existing quantitative methodologies and suitable for 
      identifying exposure to unknown organophosphorus agents.

AB  - A series of bezofuran appended 1,5-benzothiazepine compounds 7a-v was designed, 
      synthesized and evaluated as cholinesterase inhibitors. The biological assay 
      experiments showed that most of the compounds displayed a clearly selective 
      inhibition for butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), while a weak or no effect towards 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was detected. All analogs exhibited varied BChE 
      inhibitory activity with IC(50) value ranging between 1.0 ± 0.01 and 72 ± 2.8 μM 
      when compared with the standard donepezil (IC(50), 2.63 ± 0.28 μM). Among the 
      synthesized derivatives, compounds 7l, 7m and 7k exhibited the highest BChE 
      inhibition with IC(50) values of 1.0, 1.0 and 1.8 μM, respectively. The results from 
      a Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated a mixed-type inhibition for compound 7l with BChE. 
      In addition, docking studies confirmed the results obtained through in vitro 
      experiments and showed that most potent compounds bind to both the catalytic anionic 
      site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of BChE active site. The synthesized 
      compounds were also evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal 
      activities. The results indicated that the compounds possessed a broad spectrum of 
      activity against the tested microorganisms and showed high activity against both 
      gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi.

AB  - The ghrelin hormone is a 28 amino acid peptide esterified on serine 3 with octanoic 
      acid. Ghrelin is inactivated by hydrolysis of the ester bond. Previous studies have 
      relied on inhibitors to identify human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) as the hydrolase 
      in human plasma that converts ghrelin to desacyl ghrelin. The reaction of BChE with 
      ghrelin is unusual because the rate of hydrolysis is very slow and the substrate is 
      ten times larger than standard BChE substrates. These unusual features prompted us 
      to re-examine the reaction, using human BChE preparations that were more than 98% 
      pure. Conversion of ghrelin to desacyl ghrelin was monitored by MALDI TOF mass 
      spectrometry. It was found that 5 different preparations of pure human BChE all 
      hydrolyzed ghrelin, including BChE purified from human plasma, from Cohn fraction 
      IV-4, BChE immunopurified by binding to monoclonals mAb2 and B2 18-5, and 
      recombinant human BChE purified from culture medium. We reasoned that it was 
      unlikely that a common contaminant that could be responsible for ghrelin hydrolysis 
      would appear in all of these preparations. km was <1 μM, and kcat was ~1.4 min(-1). 
      A Michaelis-Menten analysis employing these kinetic values together with serum 
      concentrations of ghrelin and BChE demonstrated that BChE could hydrolyze all of the 
      ghrelin in serum in ~1 h. It was concluded that BChE is physiologically relevant for 
      the hydrolysis of ghrelin.

AB  - The human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) tetramer is composed of 4 identical 
      subunits and a noncovalently bound polyproline-rich peptide. In a previous report we 
      identified lamellipodin as the source of the polyproline-rich peptides in HuBChE 
      tetramers purified from plasma. Our current goal was to identify proteins in 
      addition to lamellipodin that donate polyproline-rich peptides to plasma HuBChE 
      tetramers. Peptides were released from 1 mg of pure plasma-derived HuBChE tetramers 
      by boiling. Mass spectrometry identified 74 polyproline-rich peptides. MALDI-TOF 
      mass spectra and spectral counting of the LC-MS/MS data supported the conclusion 
      that lamellipodin accounted for 70% of the polyproline-rich peptides. Additional 
      precursor proteins were matched through BLASTp searches, suggesting but not proving, 
      that 20 proteins including UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine transferase ALG13 homolog, 
      leiomodin 2, and zinc finger homeobox protein 2 are sources of polyproline-rich 
      peptides found in HuBChE tetramers. Eighteen polyproline-rich peptides had no match 
      in the human protein database. In conclusion, HuBChE assembles into tetramers 
      through interaction of its C-terminal domain with polyproline peptides derived from 
      a variety of proteins.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inactivates the appetite stimulating hormone 
      octanoyl-ghrelin. The hypothesis was tested that BChE-/- mice would have abnormally 
      high body weight and high levels of octanoyl-ghrelin. It was found that BChE-/- mice 
      fed a standard 5% fat diet had normal body weight. However, BChE-/- mice fed a diet 
      containing 11% fat became obese. Their obesity was not explained by increased levels 
      of octanoyl-ghrelin, or by increased caloric intake, or by decreased exercise. 
      Instead, a role for BChE in fat utilization was suggested.

AB  - Our immunization strategy introduced recombinant mouse butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
      to naïve BChE knockout mice. An extraordinarily strong immune reaction gave rise to 
      a whole spectrum of antibodies with different properties. Two selective and highly 
      efficient monoclonal anti-mouse BChE antibodies 4H1 (IgG1) and 4 C9 (IgG2a), with Kd 
      values in the nanomolar range were generated. ELISA detected BChE in as little as 
      20-50 nl of mouse plasma using 2 μg (4H1) or 4 μg (4C9). Both antibodies 
      cross-reacted with BChE in dog plasma but only 4 H1 reacted with rat BChE, 
      suggesting that the antibodies are targeted towards different epitopes. 
      Surprisingly, neither recognized human BChE. The anti-mouse BChE antibodies were 
      used in immunohistochemistry analysis of mouse muscle where they specifically 
      stained the neuromuscular junction. The antibodies enable visualization of the BChE 
      protein in the mouse tissue, thus complementing activity assays. They can be used to 
      study a long-lasting question about the existence of mixed acetylcholinesterase/BChE 
      oligomers in mouse tissues. Moreover, monoclonal anti-mouse BChE antibodies can 
      provide a simple, fast and efficient way to purify mouse BChE from small amounts of 
      starting material by using a single-step immunomagnetic bead-based protocol.
